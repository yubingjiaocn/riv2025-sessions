1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,370
- Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,410
First of all, very happy to be here

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,335
to talk about how we help our customers

4
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:10,320
modernizing credit risk application

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,850
and make the best out of
solving concrete problem

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,150
using Agentic AI in this case.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,510
So I'll talk a lot about
finance. Why is this happening?

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,210
Why we need AI agents
in order to solve some

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,060
of the credit risk challenges
that banks are facing,

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,760
particularly for business banking.

11
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,430
First, you know, who am I? I'm Adrien.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,030
I'm the Global Director of
AI solution for Cloudera.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,863
So what do I do?

14
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:38,970
I help our customers around Cloudera,

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,370
Cloudera AI to make use of the platform

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,110
and to solve the right use case

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,553
with the right solution.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,110
So, you know, first banking,

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,390
you know, banking is the
most impacted by GenAI.

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,760
That's correctly, I think
according to McKinsey,

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,638
we are looking at the $340
billion potential value creation

22
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,793
thanks to a generative AI.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,230
But it's not that we are
looking at 340 billion,

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,910
that it's gonna happen overnight, right?

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,080
There's still a lot of
challenges that we see on this.

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,620
The first one you know, is
integration in existing process.

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,530
If you look at the bank, a lot of legacy,

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,815
a lot of system that
have been here for years

29
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:21,030
and you need to make sure

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,940
that the system can get
connected to an AI system.

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,891
When you look at training the people,

32
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:31,260
entire processes were revolving
around manual processes,

33
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,805
human driven,

34
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:37,215
and you have to rethink them
on how do you move this process

35
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:41,820
to become AI-driven with human control,

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,620
which is a very different taxonomy.

37
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,250
It's not just like sprinkling
some AI on top of a process

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,564
and hoping something good happen.

39
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,600
And you look of, you see a
common topic for banking,

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,790
AI safety, guardrails.

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,920
How do you ensure that
the process is still safe

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,235
and that you're not
sending your credit data

43
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:01,383
to the wrong person or
the wrong actors, right?

44
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,820
But first let's get back to Cloudera.

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,450
So Cloudera, we are an
AI and data platform.

46
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,510
We try to, we claim that we can do,

47
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,600
you know, from your data
ingestion all the way

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,380
to your AI on one platform
with a single control plane,

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,740
with a single security layer.

50
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,600
We are completely hybrid.

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,140
Obviously our preferred partner is on AWS.

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,570
That's where most of our
customers are using them

53
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,040
when they are on cloud.

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,330
Can also do it on premise.

55
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,760
So we try to really be a
bridge between the two.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,380
For customers who might want, you know,

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,580
to do a zero code refactoring
move to the cloud,

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,660
they can obviously do it.

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,630
We provide a unified data
fabric. What does it mean?

60
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,170
It means that for all your
application from the ingestion

61
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,010
all the way to your AI,

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,950
you are managed with a
single security schema.

63
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,915
You don't need to reproduce
some like security rule

64
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,570
somewhere else.

65
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,280
And then you realize that your
access policy do not match.

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,134
Then you get 25 audit findings

67
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:06,360
and your bonus decline at the end.

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,220
I was head of AI for a bank

69
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,230
and I know that when you
get too many audit findings,

70
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,670
the bonus goes down.

71
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,320
There's a, there was a rule like this,

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,933
I discovered it the
hard way at some point.

73
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,990
We provide the open data
lake house obviously

74
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,990
as a foundation to AI application,

75
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,760
but also to reporting

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,340
and any kind of more traditional
things you want to do

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,770
with your AI, like with your lake house.

78
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,510
But today we'll focus a lot
more on the application layer.

79
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,020
Why? Because obviously we
have a big shift towards AI.

80
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,240
That banks, financial institution,

81
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,710
the largest particularly in the US,

82
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,528
have been investing
heavily on data lake house

83
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:48,120
and now it's money time, you
know, make this data to use

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,690
and be able to build
application, refactor application

85
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,373
and get some business
impact leveraging AI.

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,290
We do this, you, we do this even more

87
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,750
on the advantage of Cloudera,
which is private AI.

88
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,240
Private AI obviously is
very convenient for us

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,609
in a financial service industry.

90
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,120
Financial service industry,
meaning we are able

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,930
to provide this within your
own VPC, whether it's on cloud,

92
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,920
whether it's on-prem,

93
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,440
everything remains within
a single environment.

94
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,500
So you can deploy models,
whether it's an LLM

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,180
or a credit risk model

96
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,229
in the same cloud estate if you want,

97
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,270
which is really something

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,470
where the Cloudera
clients appreciate on it.

99
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,550
We do value a lot of open source.

100
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,420
So most of our stack is open
source. Why no vendor lock-in?

101
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,056
I always say, if you don't like us,

102
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:44,490
you can take the code and go
on open source if you want.

103
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,030
Which is I think a testimony
on the value we generate.

104
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,290
Clients are willing to pay for us,

105
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,340
not because they are locked in,

106
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,283
but because we do provide
them a lot of value.

107
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,680
And the last part, you know, is hybrid.

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,750
Like I say on cloud, on-prem,

109
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,158
you can use the estate as much as you want

110
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:04,083
and deploy the code wherever
you would like to have.

111
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,153
Okay, let's get back to our applications.

112
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,590
You know, Agentic AI,
when I talk to customer,

113
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,230
they tell us, you know, we do
see a lot of potential value.

114
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,720
The potential value is 50%
improvement in the process

115
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,360
and particularly for business
banking, commercial banking.

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,831
Why is that?

117
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:29,100
Because if you look at the
landscape of credit origination

118
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,780
for mortgages in most country,
it's heavily automatized.

119
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,150
Even in the US you know,
you have a credit bureau,

120
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,700
you get a score, you
have almost, not perfect,

121
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,353
but close to perfect information.

122
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,810
So, automation is always there.

123
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,970
The real pain point for banks,

124
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,300
and when I ask some of them
well, is the, you know,

125
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,920
how much time do you spend more tell us?

126
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,710
SMEs is where we spend a lot more time

127
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,990
and that's why the spreads
for SMEs are very high,

128
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,270
because operational costs are high

129
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,250
and it's also difficult for them

130
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,620
to get good insight on what's happening.

131
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,453
Why?

132
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:05,190
Because when you are an SME,
sometime you don't get audited

133
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,380
or the audit report is very different

134
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,880
from one company to another.

135
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
They work in very small businesses.

136
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,383
So you really have a
tremendous opportunity there.

137
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,010
But you know, in an ideal
world, we don't need this.

138
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,590
In a nice world, we have
perfect information,

139
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,810
perfect trust and perfect decision.

140
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,643
What does it mean?

141
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,750
It means that we have great data coming

142
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,490
from great P and L statement

143
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,290
that are uniform and everything.

144
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,930
That's what you see on large corporation.

145
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,720
That's not what you see
on smaller enterprise.

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,270
You have perfect trust.

147
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,497
When a company gives you a document,

148
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,724
you know this document is trustworthy.

149
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,440
Obviously that's not true,

150
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,096
especially when you start
looking at international lending

151
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:51,096
and other, let's say less
well-known enterprise.

152
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,490
And you have perfect decision.

153
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,364
Given the information that you have,

154
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,720
you can make a decision that you know

155
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,750
with certainty what is the risk
you're taking on this loan?

156
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,940
Meaning your credit risk model

157
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,440
should be working fine, right?

158
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,380
That's obviously not the case, right?

159
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,710
We do have a lot more
friction that are remaining

160
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,443
when you look at the
loan origination process.

161
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,610
You go from an application, verification,

162
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,170
underwriting at some point

163
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,050
and then maybe some approval if it's good.

164
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,340
Here, what do you see as key blockers?

165
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,660
Well, you see quite a lot, right?

166
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,483
Documents. Many of them
are going to be physical.

167
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,700
Especially when it's an audited statement,

168
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,530
you still find them with a stamp

169
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,910
and even if it's a DocuSign,

170
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,190
it does not help much more, right?

171
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,590
You have policies inside the bank,

172
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,564
so the policy against
which you're supposed

173
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,110
to match the credit application.

174
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,400
This policy, what is it?

175
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,250
It was written by human for human,

176
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,420
it's not returned by an AI,
it's not readily enforceable.

177
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,380
And then later on, you know,

178
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,260
you'll see covenant monitoring and others.

179
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,430
So you have obviously a
heavy human intervention

180
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,800
in this particular processes.

181
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,620
Whether it's application,
collecting the document,

182
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,063
then saying, "Hey, you're
missing this file."

183
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,000
Making a decision.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,530
Yes, there are machine learning models

185
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,970
that are making decisions,

186
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,740
but if you look at the
machine learning models

187
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,818
for enterprise and small
and medium enterprise,

188
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:25,020
the human input and the expert
input, how they call it,

189
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,420
is still quite heavy, right?

190
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,890
So that's why we do see

191
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,260
that there's still quite
a lot of opportunities

192
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,000
and the opportunities
you know, are numerous.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,043
First of all, an AI-powered origination.

194
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,820
Can you make the document
review more seamless?

195
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,530
Can you review credit memo

196
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,555
and states against this policy,

197
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,587
this credit memo seems to match

198
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,150
or hey, there are some deviation.

199
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,750
Here, the deviation,
please go reach an approval

200
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,810
for a certain, by a certain authority.

201
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,190
Could be a chief risk officer,

202
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,223
it could be just a director,
compliance, anyone, right?

203
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,380
And the last one is obviously
AI-powered loan management.

204
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,220
We do see some banks now doing
automated call collection.

205
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,783
I was working at at a bank before in Asia

206
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,460
and instead of having people
calling for loan connection,

207
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,350
they put a chatbot to it

208
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,630
and if the chatbot managed
to reach out the person

209
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,000
that is being passed to a loan processor.

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,860
So maybe, and in the US I know some

211
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,440
of you might be receiving some calls

212
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
that are automated from the banks

213
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,556
in order to try to get
you to pay back the loans.

214
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:32,970
And then later on, you know,

215
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,860
we can also have
AI-powered loan management.

216
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,720
Yeah, risk review.

217
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,020
And risk review is something
that is very simple,

218
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,670
yet very complicated.

219
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,490
For enterprise, it's any
new information may lead

220
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,990
to a risk review.

221
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,980
Think about it like this.

222
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,180
Tomorrow a board member of
this enterprise is changing,

223
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,720
what are the implication
from a risk standpoint

224
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,313
for this particular credit?

225
00:09:57,427 --> 00:10:00,420
Might be nothing, but if
you have to do it manually,

226
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,390
you have to research, oh,
this person is on the board.

227
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,550
What is the name
screening for this person?

228
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,640
What is the new risk scoring that we see

229
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,500
and so on and so forth, right?

230
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,250
So it might not be straightforward.

231
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,770
For today, we're gonna
focus a lot more on, okay,

232
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,640
I have a policy, I have a credit memo.

233
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,680
How do we know that this policy

234
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,540
and this credit memo are matching?

235
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,100
And we do have some customers

236
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,862
really actively investing a lot on this.

237
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,880
Why? Because that's a very
large bottleneck on it.

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,140
So we have a credit risk policy

239
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,150
written by human for human,

240
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,470
might be a mortgage policy,

241
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,540
it might be an enterprise policy.

242
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,010
We have a risk memo

243
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,117
and basically the credit
policy is gonna state,

244
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:47,772
"Okay, your loan to value must be 80%."

245
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,550
Does this credit proposal fulfill this

246
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,980
or do we need an escalation process?

247
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,746
That's a process that can
take really a lot of time

248
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:59,822
and leads to loan being postponed

249
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:02,103
and not being approved in time.

250
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:05,130
So we are going to have a demo

251
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,730
where we create an agent
per rules in the policy

252
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,390
and then this agent can be
matched against the credit memo.

253
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,390
That can be seen as a create
application from an enterprise.

254
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,230
Before that, you know,

255
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,330
the process that we have chosen for this,

256
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,150
that we will have a
creation for each agent

257
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,690
by reading the policy, an
AI system can understand

258
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,610
what are the right agent to extract

259
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,040
and what are the right agent to create

260
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,500
so that you get a list
of, in this example,

261
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,280
having couple of hundred of
agents, then we can select it.

262
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,680
The selection in the
example is still manual,

263
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,090
can be automated.

264
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,410
We do it manually because you know,

265
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,020
still some human intervention,

266
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,990
you don't want to apply the
wrong rule to the wrong memo.

267
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,850
Then you get obviously a wrong output.

268
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,193
Then the execution and the monitoring.

269
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,280
It's really going to look like this.

270
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,841
We're trying to bring
together a bank process,

271
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:02,790
a bank policy, and also
the people in the bank

272
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,363
as like human in the loop layer

273
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:06,900
and even in the future,

274
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,153
try to bring in the
machine learning model.

275
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,460
That's just the technical
slide that I have to put.

276
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,700
How did we build it?

277
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,790
So I build it leveraging
couple of other technology,

278
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,430
some open source, some of our partners,

279
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,710
everything runs on Cloudera,

280
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,940
Neo4j as a graph database

281
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,283
in order to bring better,

282
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,750
you know, relationship
between various agents.

283
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,640
I did find that it improves
heavily the extraction of agent

284
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,280
to have a graph database on it.

285
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,540
Also use Docling as a document processor

286
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,280
for this particular use case.

287
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,680
There's other technologies
that are possible,

288
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,260
but overall, you know,
we're gonna extract,

289
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,230
find the agent, assess
what are the requirements

290
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,650
and then put it in a graph database.

291
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,320
And when we want to evaluate
the credit proposal,

292
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,420
we retrieve these agents,

293
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,164
assess whether the condition are satisfied

294
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,093
and then get a final memo on it.

295
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,020
This start or do I need to click?

296
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,100
Alright, so this is the
Cloudera AI workbench

297
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,960
where we have deployed an application

298
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,840
that is meant exactly for this.

299
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,673
First step, you know,

300
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,890
is we are going to select a credit policy.

301
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,170
And the credit policy
is one that I made up

302
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,480
based on another bank's policy,

303
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,250
but I can't use exactly
their own policy, obviously.

304
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,793
So it's a fairly standard one

305
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:42,822
where you have some threshold
that needs to be met

306
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,450
and a lot of rules in it

307
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,860
that's very typical

308
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,710
of what you can find in the bank.

309
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,820
We'll upload it, trigger
the first analysis pipeline,

310
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,270
which is going to
retrieve a set of agents.

311
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,411
The set of agents are
converted into some JSON file,

312
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:03,660
but first we can obviously select them.

313
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,210
So you will see one example is,

314
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,144
you know the credit report age limit here.

315
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,410
It just states

316
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,790
that the application must
be as recent as 30 days.

317
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,470
Just a very basic rule.

318
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,210
We can also have automated selection.

319
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,997
I implemented it so that I
don't need to bother thinking,

320
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:24,513
"Oh I need to trigger this
one, this one, this one,

321
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,354
get this agent to run, this agent to run."

322
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:30,510
And AI will decide which
agents are relevant

323
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,066
for this particular credit application.

324
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,808
Then I upload a mortgage
application in this case

325
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:40,290
with everything you expect
from a mortgage application,

326
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,503
income and other topics.

327
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,390
The policy was extracted

328
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,290
and some graph, knowledge graph was built.

329
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,329
And this does help a lot in bringing,

330
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,930
let's say relationship
between various rules

331
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,953
so that you can get all the
mortgage rules together.

332
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,520
We also provide observability

333
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,340
through another partner called Galileo.

334
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,310
And in this case, you know,
it does provide insight

335
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,600
on what's going on on the
agent that we are running,

336
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
just a basic observability observation.

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,523
If we go back to our application.

338
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,780
So it should be finishing, I hope.

339
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,820
Okay, so it does give us an
overall compliance score.

340
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,460
So in this case,

341
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,690
you know the credit report
age limit was selected.

342
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,690
They say it is fine, the credit
report is three days old.

343
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,840
So most likely this particular agent rule

344
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,570
that we define is actually okay.

345
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,946
The bank statement age limit is fine.

346
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:48,078
Just tell us that the minimum down payment

347
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,280
for first time buyer is actually correct.

348
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,730
I think in this case the
down payment is at 9%

349
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,830
and the credit policy was at 3%.

350
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,950
So it's able to make some computation.

351
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,920
This was not given in
the application memo.

352
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,402
The application memo we stated,
"This is the down payment,

353
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:10,182
this is the loan amount and
therefore that's how it works."

354
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,720
We used our partner
one more time, Galileo,

355
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,171
in order to assess what's going on

356
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,823
and whether everything run properly.

357
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,320
So we are able to log every single steps

358
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,830
straight from Cloudera AI in order to look

359
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,820
what is the execution.

360
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,010
In this case it's a workflow.

361
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,880
So it goes from left to right
in a fairly smooth manner

362
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,120
and we are able to, you know,
debug if something happened.

363
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,340
Was this the right agent to pick?

364
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,380
Was it executed properly

365
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,620
or does it needs to be
rerun at some point?

366
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,100
That's something quite
useful in order to avoid,

367
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,006
so there's some cost management
in case we are using some

368
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:53,223
in case we are using some other thing.

369
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,843
That's all for me.

370
00:16:56,843 --> 00:17:00,630
So I think I've been showing,
you know, on Cloudera AI

371
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,440
and leveraging some of
our great partners on AWS,

372
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,170
how we can modernize credit application.

373
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,960
It's not just theoretical on the demo.

374
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,290
I actually implemented this
for one of our customer

375
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,250
in order to double check
what humans were doing.

376
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,660
Let's be realistic.

377
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,881
Agentic AI is still at the infancy

378
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,720
and there's more, like,
there's still a lot

379
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,300
of duplicate checks that needs to be done.

380
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,180
But there's actually a bank
using this in order to,

381
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,920
you know, to check

382
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,640
whether some potential
audit issue are happening

383
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,640
inside the credit risk
origination process.

384
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,080
So I think it's generating great value

385
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,770
and if you want to know more,
please visit us at our booth,

386
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,052
1175 right over there.

387
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,040
We'll be very happy to
discuss more about it.

388
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Thank you very much.
