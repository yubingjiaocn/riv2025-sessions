1
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello everybody,

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:05,538
thanks for taking some time and peeling off of your expo

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,219
expeditions to sit down.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,698
If you're anything like me, you've walked about 20,000

5
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:11,698
steps in the last few days, so sitting is probably a,

6
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,419
a welcome, uh, repar.

7
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:16,010
Uh, so let's jump in.

8
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:18,670
Today I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about Red Panda

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,670
for those of you who are not familiar. Uh, for those

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,809
of you that have experience in the streaming

11
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,429
world, this,

12
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,708
we're not talking about Netflix streaming and videos,

13
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:28,489
this is streaming data and data movement throughout

14
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,250
organizations, so we'll educate you there.

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,149
Uh, we'll get into the cross sections of AI

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,259
and streaming and where we've seen our

17
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,048
early research,

18
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,340
uh, find intersections that we think can be

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,649
very useful when you're adopting AI into

20
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,228
organizations.

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,348
Uh, we'll do, we'll actually dig into some architecture,

22
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,529
so we'll try to keep it high level, but for the people

23
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:48,789
that have experience at the infrastructure level,

24
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,200
we'll actually talk a little bit about how we deploy these,

25
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:53,310
uh, within ecosystems, within DPCs,

26
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,149
things like that.

27
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:57,029
Uh, lastly, try to provide you some actual practical

28
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:59,029
guidance, you know, I see a lot of use

29
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:01,469
cases thrown around, but try to give you some actual

30
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,590
actionable intelligence into how

31
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,629
we're integrating these, where to start, and where

32
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:06,250
to go.

33
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,599
So, uh, Red Panda as an

34
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,698
organization is traditionally in the streaming space.

35
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,859
Uh, for those of you who are familiar with Kafka,

36
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,159
we operate on top of the Kafka protocol,

37
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,519
and we help organizations like these move

38
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,558
data throughout their organizations. So this

39
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:21,269
could be,

40
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:23,558
uh, large financial services like

41
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:25,599
the New York Stock Exchange where we do very highly,

42
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,739
highly transactional workloads, moving

43
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,459
millions and millions as in uh 10

44
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,359
gig 10s of gig.

45
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,213
Bytes of seconds of data throughout their trading platforms.

46
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,573
This could also mean retailers where

47
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:37,653
we are

48
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,974
building systems that help them federate their

49
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,213
data and spread out session captures

50
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:44,653
throughout and essentially keep all this

51
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:46,924
data moving through durably, reliably,

52
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,513
and deployed

53
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,254
where their customers

54
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,933
typically deploy their workloads. This could be

55
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,174
self-hosted, this could be in any cloud or hybrid

56
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,900
nature. Now

57
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,019
this is just a quick look. This is

58
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,168
our typical form factor, so we have a

59
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:04,260
single binary, but this can be deployed

60
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,579
anywhere. We're cloud agnostic and this, this

61
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,638
includes self-hosted.

62
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,508
So this allows us to move throughout many

63
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,659
organizations and deploy across a wide spectrum

64
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,360
of use cases and verticals,

65
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,058
uh, all the way from very

66
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:19,058
security conscious organizations

67
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,344
that need very high restrictive. Class

68
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:22,044
zero data,

69
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,455
things like security, PII, PHI for

70
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:24,985
healthcare,

71
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,324
all the way to just typical retail data.

72
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,944
Now, uh, over the last few years, you can

73
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,564
see on the left and right, we've

74
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,944
taken great effort to expand

75
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:36,064
our ability to uh

76
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,493
extend into ecosystems,

77
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,903
pull data from source systems like typical

78
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,504
databases, MySQL, Postress, takeover

79
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:44,163
use cases like CDC.

80
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,919
Uh, in the middle there, we are providing you a durable

81
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,520
log, ways in which we are capturing

82
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,750
everything that's happening through those in an immutable, uh,

83
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,919
in an appended-only way, and then storing that

84
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,960
for safe access.

85
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,308
That'll come into play with where we're headed with

86
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:58,729
our AI products as well.

87
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,159
Lastly, on the right-hand side, you'll see

88
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,493
we can sync to. Most common solutions.

89
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:06,314
Uh, a lot of our customers need to pull data from

90
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:08,413
a very sparse, uh,

91
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:10,653
set of databases and microservices

92
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:11,335
and tools,

93
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,604
federate them out to another set of,

94
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:16,433
maybe Snowflake for analytics, maybe data bricks

95
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,463
to, to use Iceberg to do analytics, things

96
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,344
of that nature.

97
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,974
Uh, and this is really the foundation for which we're

98
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,133
building our AI products, uh, the, the

99
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,145
interconnectivity, the, the ability

100
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:28,455
to collect all these logs, and the ability to deploy

101
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:29,344
these anywhere.

102
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,210
Uh, as far as form factors, again,

103
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:34,969
all of this runs typically on,

104
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,250
for self-hosted bare metal, but then in

105
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,368
our cloud environments, this is all on top of K8s.

106
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,490
So we can scale this horizontally or vertically very

107
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,569
easy. It makes it easy for us to, to

108
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,368
handle DevOps and uh

109
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,649
acclimate to whatever the workloads we're, we're working

110
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,969
with. Now, let's

111
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,288
get into the AI and Agentic.

112
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,118
We've released uh our Agentic

113
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,288
data plane. This is built on top

114
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,330
of the, the form factor you just saw.

115
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,969
Uh, to give you a little bit of dive in, you're gonna have

116
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,080
agents, and the simplest

117
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:05,558
definition for agents is you have,

118
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:07,659
uh, a body that has intent in the form of

119
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,740
a prompt, it needs access to a model,

120
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,520
an LLM,

121
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,179
and then it needs a set of tools that you can use

122
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,778
to, uh, build, uh, complicated

123
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:18,319
processes or functions to get, you know, outputs.

124
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,100
So in our world, what you see in this box

125
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,139
here runs on AWS inside a private

126
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,319
VPC or it could be running, uh,

127
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,319
in your self-hosted, uh, data center.

128
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:29,769
And we provide all of these services that run

129
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,798
at runtime. So your agent is a separate

130
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:32,829
service that runs,

131
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,358
we have gateways that allow you access to

132
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,730
LLMs, uh, various, uh, types,

133
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,480
uh, and as you can see, we're not choosing a specific

134
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,639
vendor. We believe we're, we're not gonna

135
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,730
try to build your specialty agents. We, we think

136
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,744
that that's gonna be uh. Where you come in,

137
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,504
but we're coming from the infrastructure up. So

138
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,514
if you want to change out models, if you want access

139
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:52,903
to Bedrock, for example,

140
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,274
if you want access to OpenAI, you want

141
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,463
to use anthropic or cloud,

142
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,303
um, it doesn't matter to us because we think changing

143
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,314
those out is actually a superpower to allow

144
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:04,035
you to really dial in your agents.

145
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,730
Uh, as all this data is moving through, you

146
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,230
see all the lines, there's a lot of interconnectivity

147
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,579
and the streaming domain. We're used to handling all

148
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,699
of this disaggregation. We're used to

149
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,738
having to track down, get access

150
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:17,879
to all of these source systems that could be either

151
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,540
inside your organization or outside of it.

152
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,858
Uh, as you can see, there's some public internet traffic

153
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:25,100
here. We're used to egressing and ingressing

154
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,420
very sensitive information. We know how to do BPC

155
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,920
peering. We know how to do all this interconnectivity.

156
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,298
So we're baking this into how we approach AI and

157
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,199
how we integrate it.

158
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,428
Uh, lastly, you'll see at the bottom there,

159
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,048
all, all of these services are dumping to

160
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,829
a log or observability log,

161
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,119
uh, which would provide you the ability to do

162
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:45,160
things like replay through as agents are

163
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,209
being built, and we're already very good

164
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:49,309
at this. This is our bread and butter. This is something we've been doing

165
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:51,369
for the last 7 years. We know how to protect these,

166
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,488
we know how to distribute these logs, and we really know how

167
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,889
to make the best use of them in a very cost efficient

168
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,975
manner. So if we apply. That to agents and

169
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,014
all these gateways, we learned that agents

170
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,095
send out a ton of messages into

171
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,454
its entry system between each other

172
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:05,824
using AOA protocols,

173
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:08,105
every call it does to an MCP, for example,

174
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,153
and all of that can be written to these logs durably

175
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,194
for safekeeping and for replayability.

176
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,290
Uh, so, I, I keep hearing a lot

177
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,319
about what are the big challenges with this,

178
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,488
and where to start, and I hear governance, I

179
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:23,649
hear security, I hear access,

180
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,358
but really,

181
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,689
once we start digging into this, it becomes about

182
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,730
like trust first, is how

183
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,209
do you trust this entity that you're gonna give autonomy

184
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,488
to, uh, to make decisions, to

185
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:35,488
potentially trigger events that may,

186
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,988
uh, go off in your organization.

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,678
And the best way, you know, I'm, I'm

188
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:41,759
no, uh, I'm no writer, Ernest seem the way I

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,838
said it best, but the best way is to find out is,

190
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,178
is, is to extend some trust at first. So,

191
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,759
uh, I'll talk to you a little bit about the practical approach of how we

192
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,858
do that, how do we provide an environment where you can

193
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,959
give it some trust, see how these agents behave,

194
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,100
track all of this, uh, and then

195
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,399
start to figure out how do we implement this more

196
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,939
widely and how do we take it to production.

197
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,079
Uh, so first off, in our ADP

198
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,439
you can see we have a layered approach. So

199
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,470
in, in our thesis for how our products are

200
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,428
coming to fruition,

201
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:10,798
we have an action layer, which is where the agents

202
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,920
are actually taking action. These could be

203
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,149
security agents that are handling very uh

204
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:15,889
sensitive data.

205
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,548
This could be coding agents, which are very popular

206
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,838
right now and we see the heaviest use of, of course, it's

207
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:21,720
very approachable.

208
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,238
But then when you get some more, uh, esoteric

209
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:26,678
cases like, uh, manufacturing IOT

210
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,738
where you have different types Of agents that are

211
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:29,480
taking action.

212
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,730
They're all gonna pass through this data plan.

213
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,040
And if we can

214
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,420
provide a way for you to track all of

215
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
that, um,

216
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,639
uh, log all of that data, uh, responsibly,

217
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,079
and then, uh, also, uh,

218
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,220
collect all the reasoning layer access as

219
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,369
well. So every time an agent's calling out to an LLM,

220
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,088
uh, we, we want it to be passing through this single

221
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,619
plane, this data plane, and allowing you all the tools

222
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:52,480
to track that.

223
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,579
Uh, it's meant to really start to target,

224
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,000
I mean, common term we hear shadow AI.

225
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,278
If you've been around for a while, you've heard it as shadow

226
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,298
IT back in the day.

227
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,869
But we see a lot of this, people just going out, spinning things

228
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:04,798
up and running it,

229
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,199
and we believe that to trust your

230
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,309
organization, we start with a single plane, allow people

231
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:12,079
access, do proper authorization, authentication,

232
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,410
uh, do proper conventionaling, and people will

233
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,639
just use it through this plane. And that way we can actually

234
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,959
effectively track, effectively make policies

235
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,920
that make sense for your organizations.

236
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,319
Uh, so back to streaming and why we're layering

237
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,350
this in, streaming is already everywhere. We

238
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,358
stream for pretty much every single

239
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,559
vertical, and our use cases

240
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,798
span cybersecurity, a very sensitive

241
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:36,058
data, all the way to non-PII data,

242
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,918
including like hospitality data, loyalty

243
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,469
programs,

244
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,840
uh, analytics, things of that nature.

245
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,413
So where we're coming from is. Look

246
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,625
at how can we give you effective tools

247
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,183
to build into this existing infrastructure? Why

248
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,264
retool things that are when we already have

249
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,344
data flowing through an organization that's already

250
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:55,455
been authenticated with all of your end users, all of your

251
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,705
database admins have already created service accounts for

252
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,465
access to all of this?

253
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,803
How can we use this connectivity

254
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:03,244
to provide agents, uh, better context

255
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,384
and, uh, better ways to, to

256
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:06,024
operate?

257
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,950
Uh, in the streaming world, we already

258
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,479
have,

259
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,048
we, we understand that there's some primitives for,

260
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,440
for agents that don't apply, right? There are primitives

261
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,570
that we work with to move data very rapidly,

262
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,129
uh, throughout organizations, but that doesn't encompass

263
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,210
things like A2A

264
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:23,649
or MCP protocols. So how do we layer those

265
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,190
in? Well, we already have

266
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,308
very effective methods to distribute and do

267
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:29,989
asynchronous operations, right?

268
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:33,109
We already have this publish subscribe for those of you

269
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:35,149
unfamiliar with the streaming domain, where

270
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,298
we're publishing messages,

271
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,590
they're getting written to brokers, which is collecting this

272
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,779
immutable log, and then we can have any

273
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,389
number of subscribers subscribe to this. Information

274
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,750
to pull it and go anywhere else.

275
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,428
Now, if you really think about it, the same archetype

276
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:49,590
can be applied to agents. They're gonna become distributed

277
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,899
nature. They're going to

278
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,590
be sending messages. They're going to be subscribing

279
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,908
to many different services, tools, etc.

280
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,229
So we're applying the same principles that we've learned in

281
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,298
streaming to the, to the agent

282
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:01,149
deployments.

283
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,750
Uh, architecturally we look at, we already

284
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,750
know how to decouple services, and if you

285
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,849
think about agents, we have tools that are decoupled,

286
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,969
we have LLMs and reasoning that are decoupled,

287
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,349
but you still have these intersections in which you want to

288
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,649
collect all this information. You need to do tracing

289
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,788
on all those little pieces and you actually want the

290
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:17,945
outputs from all. All of that

291
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,533
stored durably and readily.

292
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,683
The last thing you want is a very high critical agent

293
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,634
to go down and be able to replay data,

294
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:25,955
understand what happened about it,

295
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,445
what happened to the data. Do you understand how to move

296
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,594
it and do DR responsibly? These are the

297
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,864
same concepts that we already do in streaming very well.

298
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,840
Uh, last thing is we're already built for real-time.

299
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,219
We, we help customers migrate from large

300
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,418
batch jobs all the way to very, very

301
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,408
fast, uh, real-time applications.

302
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,279
And there are cases in which,

303
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,619
uh, agents are good and bad for either batch or

304
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:48,899
streaming, but over time, we believe that

305
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,019
more agents are gonna be.

306
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:51,724
Uh, utilizing streaming,

307
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,543
uh, information either for event-driven architectures

308
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:56,825
to help trigger or kick off or to help

309
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,024
provide the most up to-date context because that's

310
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,163
one of the more powerful features that we've seen

311
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,024
for agents is

312
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,303
real-time context. Can we get it to them and can

313
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,533
it influence their decision making right now?

314
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,399
Uh, so in the problem space, we see,

315
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,710
you know, context building and maintenance being an issue,

316
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,029
uh, authorization, governance,

317
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,519
uh, we see auditing be an issue with

318
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,759
agents, how do you, can you audit these, replaying

319
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,408
and validation of agent actions, and,

320
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,038
and then multi-agent orchestration. And

321
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:27,149
again, these are all data streaming problems

322
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,359
that we've essentially solved in one capacity

323
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,719
that we're now augmenting to solve for agenttic

324
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,298
issues that we come across.

325
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,899
Uh, especially the governance and

326
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,969
replay, we already are at all these

327
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:40,099
intersections, as I said, we're collecting

328
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,259
all these tracing and we're storing it durably

329
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,330
and immutably. So you can't go in and alter

330
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,729
these logs. That way you have, uh,

331
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,798
already ingrained auditing pathway

332
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:49,509
that you can use.

333
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,298
And the last is a multi-agent orchestration.

334
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,619
We're gonna start to see these systems distribute very

335
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:55,279
widely.

336
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,729
Uh, and it's gonna be hard to track which agent

337
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:58,619
is doing what.

338
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,450
Well, it turns out we already do that in a capacity.

339
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,609
Most customers use us for logging activities

340
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,729
where we're collecting logs across maybe 15

341
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,889
different services, passing them through, filtering

342
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:08,408
them for them.

343
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,690
So we already have this framework set up to

344
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,769
be able to take, take this action from this like

345
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,908
DevOps infrastructure perspective.

346
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:19,038
Um, so just to hammer that home, uh,

347
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,428
in the context abroad, you can see here in this little diagram,

348
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,840
you know, I have agents deployed.

349
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,359
In our system, agents are deployed on K8s

350
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,399
and scalable within your VPC, so

351
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,399
we all have them running on pods, uh, but

352
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,399
they still need to get access out to databases. They're,

353
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,710
they are egressing your VPC out,

354
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,918
and we start to see a spider web create, right? All

355
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,538
these points of interconnectivity.

356
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,080
Um, our thesis is that

357
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,099
enforcement on that single data plane is

358
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:44,330
gonna be easier to manage from a DevOps perspective,

359
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:46,899
uh, and provides like uniformity. So you can actually

360
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,808
track, all right, how,

361
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,779
especially when you get to multi-agent orchestration, you have many agents

362
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,788
accessing the same MCP tools potentially,

363
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,320
or the same data sets.

364
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:55,700
Um, so,

365
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,178
so that is where we're really coming from with like a single plane,

366
00:12:58,298 --> 00:12:59,359
a single data layer.

367
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,599
Uh, so,

368
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,129
just, just to summarize that, like we really

369
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,369
think that the intersection of data, that means

370
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,769
access, authentication,

371
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,250
uh, authorization to those sources, and this

372
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,869
includes MCP servers and just general connectors,

373
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,658
because you'll have both of your availability.

374
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,340
Uh, the AAI side of it means access to reasoning

375
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,408
models, this could be LLMs or this could be other

376
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,399
classification models,

377
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,849
and then governance, the ability to govern

378
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:25,889
all of this in one space, uh, and we want to

379
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,190
be at the intersection of that.

380
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:31,048
Now, let's talk about practical adoption. Like

381
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,109
how do you actually get this stuff into production?

382
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,570
Um, what we've seen when we speak with

383
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,599
customers, we get a lot of questions on

384
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,609
how do I get data access. Like, even if you're the

385
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:41,769
best at building, let's say, a

386
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,119
model context protocol and building MCP servers,

387
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:46,359
you still have to go to your database admin

388
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,489
to get access to this. They can't just spin it up

389
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:49,750
and say, go grab data.

390
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,149
Uh, which data can it get access

391
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,570
to? What, what is the user permission structures?

392
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,250
So it really starts with our organizational

393
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,349
conversations, like, talk to your infrastructure teams about

394
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,570
what data should be available. Your security

395
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,609
teams will know what are lower level

396
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,808
or non-class 0, class 1 data that

397
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:07,759
may be used to start testing these,

398
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,288
but that is the slowest piece. It's really not that

399
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:12,529
hard to stand up K-8s, get your services

400
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,754
running, and get connected. It's Really hard

401
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,913
to start working through how do I connect them? How

402
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,955
do I get data to this agent? Uh, is that

403
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,094
a database query through an MCP protocol?

404
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,594
Is that actually a connector doing a CDC

405
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:24,173
workload?

406
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,514
That piece is taking the longest, so I

407
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,945
actually advise people to start there, start asking,

408
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,754
where can I get access sooner and

409
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,433
what types of access can I give it.

410
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,298
Uh, on deployment, um,

411
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,210
we're recommending starting with secure

412
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,408
VPCs and private networking just as

413
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:43,129
a safe rail and safeguard, right?

414
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,529
This goes back to that trust component. You really don't want

415
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:47,570
your agent egressing and making decisions

416
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,690
out, especially on the open internet, when you're not

417
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,529
sure of its non-deterministic behavior.

418
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,859
So lock it down, log it to.

419
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:55,854
within your local VPC

420
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:58,445
and then until you really get a good understanding

421
00:14:58,445 --> 00:14:59,913
of what the actions is taking,

422
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:01,933
how does the particular LLM behave,

423
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:05,114
uh, especially when you're changing the prompt

424
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,195
iteratively, because typically

425
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:09,234
when we're developing agents, you're doing it very quickly.

426
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,433
You're changing the prompt, seeing what the behavior is

427
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,673
and seeing if it matches your measurable criteria.

428
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,109
Uh,

429
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,029
lastly,

430
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,440
this is kind of antithetical to what I've seen,

431
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,750
but I see people searching for

432
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,788
new use cases and new things to solve with

433
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,190
agents, and I come from a

434
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,269
processing background, uh, and that's the use

435
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,729
case we'll dive into is IOT manufacturing.

436
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,349
When you really wanna automate something, you don't

437
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,349
start with a, an amorphous

438
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,580
thing that You don't understand, you should pick something

439
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,658
that you know already, that you already have

440
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,408
well documented steps for.

441
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,739
That way you can actually understand, OK,

442
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,918
is the agent behaving

443
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:46,739
in a manner that we already understand? Uh, let's

444
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,840
say, rather than take a, a really

445
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:51,178
crazy problem, try to throw it at it, start with

446
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,259
the actual document that has 30 steps in it

447
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,960
and see if your agent can replicate it.

448
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,769
Uh, that's much easier to track, much easier to implement,

449
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,279
uh, and, and really gives you a good starting point,

450
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,158
especially because you understand how to measure it.

451
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,940
Um, and number one question I get

452
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,259
when we're speaking to customers is, what are the use cases?

453
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,460
And it's like, well, let's start with something. Let's

454
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,580
augment a process and help one

455
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,320
person become 3 within your organization

456
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,178
by figuring out what are the processes they understand

457
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:16,918
very well.

458
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,469
Um,

459
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,788
so for us in

460
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,989
the streaming domain, we're targeting low latency

461
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:26,190
use cases because that's a strength of ours.

462
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,418
This, this doesn't mean that agents

463
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:30,629
can't be used for, uh, longer

464
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,750
runtime or more heavy deep

465
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,830
thinking, but if we're being realistic,

466
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,469
uh,

467
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:38,119
we like to look at. Ad tech manufacturing

468
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,058
gaming where

469
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,440
seconds matter and you want inferences coming

470
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,349
through agents and decisions being made quickly,

471
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,739
that's gonna help just drive value right sooner

472
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,359
so common, these are some of the common latency

473
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,200
domains today we're looking at manufacturing

474
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
is where I have a background and we'll look at a

475
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,119
use case so.

476
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,058
In a manufacturing example,

477
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,989
pardon my little arrows there, they're supposed to be going sideways.

478
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,519
Um, you have a lot of equipment on a factory

479
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,519
floor. Uh, it's a common use case where we're,

480
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,709
we're aggregating all this data through maybe a

481
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,868
protocol like MQTT. We're pulling it in,

482
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,420
and we're doing a factory management system,

483
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,598
and then we're doing an operational database that's,

484
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,358
that we're coalescing this data to.

485
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,039
So within this use case, where

486
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,078
could we deploy agents? Well, there's a couple of places.

487
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:22,539
Since red panda can run at the edge, we can run them

488
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,559
very closely to the machine equipment.

489
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,239
And common use case would be they're augmenting

490
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,438
a technician and helping guide them through a

491
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,509
process of, all right, uh, something happened at the

492
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,778
edge, uh, an agent has been monitoring

493
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:36,038
the stream and already has access

494
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,198
through maybe a vector store or maybe even

495
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,358
just raw text

496
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:40,659
about a given manual,

497
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,917
and, uh, a technician will physically

498
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,958
go stand there and be given information, and say, hey,

499
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,307
based on this information,

500
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:48,718
uh, here's the decision criteria or

501
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,038
the RCA you should work through to repair this

502
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,348
machine. Um, so that's like a

503
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,309
physical use.

504
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:56,588
Now, when we get more towards the operational

505
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,709
database side where we can have more agents

506
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:59,250
running,

507
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:02,289
there's where we can start to provide context. Things

508
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,449
like, uh, let's say

509
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,630
it's, it's, it's common to have multiple machines

510
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,670
of the same type. Let's say we have 50 of them, and

511
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,650
I install spare parts into one,

512
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,880
from a specific provider with a SKU.

513
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,848
Um, we already have systems in, in

514
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,969
place that can give you indicators

515
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,049
that a machine is failing, but what it can't

516
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:22,150
do is reason and think and say,

517
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,410
all right, we installed the same spare part

518
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,769
in two different machines.

519
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,449
Uh, I'm gonna go ahead and recommend you stop the

520
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:30,769
second machine that hasn't even displayed problems

521
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,049
yet on any of the telemetry metrics,

522
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,500
uh, and, and, and do remediation

523
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,729
based on knowledge that I gained through context, right?

524
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:40,104
And that could be just a PDF that was uploaded with their spare

525
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,463
parts, uh, when they did change of management.

526
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,864
So that's like one of the use cases

527
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,934
that actually makes sense to have

528
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,025
an agent that's running 24/7 that

529
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,334
has human in the loop and is helping you

530
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:53,424
uncover and, and, and stop

531
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,424
something from uh happening that would

532
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,584
actually, you wouldn't discover through just

533
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,203
traditional preventative maintenance,

534
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,924
uh, or traditional PID controllers.

535
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:03,989
So that's an actual just um

536
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,338
a bare bones use case, that gives you like an idea

537
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,500
of, of where you can deploy these that actually create

538
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,279
value.

539
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,078
So that's all I have for you. Thank

540
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:15,239
you. Really, I really appreciate you taking some time out.

541
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,400
Um, and if you need to talk to me that we don't have a

542
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,439
Q&A here, but I'll be at our booth, which is

543
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,479
right over there by the Sula DB booth if you have

544
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,279
questions about the session.

545
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:23,118
Thank you.
