1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,190
- Alright, good afternoon.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,240
How's everyone doing?

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,780
Here we go. That's a good way to start.

4
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:09,840
So my name is Brendan Grady.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,020
I'm the general manager of
AI and analytics at Qlik.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
I am joined today by one
of our amazing customers,

7
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:20,940
Juan, who will come up and
talk about his use case.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,300
So I was reading the topic
on the way down here,

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,970
and I gotta tell you,
that's a pretty scary topic

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,193
for a four 30 session, right?

11
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:32,010
I mean, I hesitate in your history,

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,100
but the reality is, is that
if we are hesitating right now

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,440
with all of the changes that are going on,

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,350
we are gonna be history,
we will be left behind.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,420
So I want to just do a quick
show of hands in the audience.

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,310
Who here has more of a technical role?

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,090
People that are building
application developers, right?

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,443
More business people.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,740
Wow, we're split 50
50. That's pretty good.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,050
So I'll try to tailor the presentation

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,450
for both audiences.

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,087
So for those of you that
are in the building world,

23
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,640
there's a reality of what you're doing

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,370
in supporting your businesses
and your organizations,

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,657
and ultimately your businesses
and your organizations,

26
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:13,950
they're all driven by some
type of decision, right?

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,970
And that decision can be super
tactical about, you know,

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,520
which shirt do I wear today, for example?

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,180
Or which sweater do I wear
today? Or maybe even which shoes?

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,950
Or it can be super strategic.

31
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,290
Do I buy all of my clothing, for example,

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,492
from Neiman Marcus, right?

33
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,560
You can get really big.

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,980
So all of those decisions are critical

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,260
to the way your organizations perform.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,560
And if you are not basing
this on all of your data,

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,840
and using the right techniques,

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,910
there is a cost of not knowing.

39
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,980
And I always like to challenge my audience

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,674
when I present on this to do a
couple things when you leave,

41
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,676
go Google AI failures.

42
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:55,080
Some of them are really funny,

43
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,030
some of them are pretty scary.

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,410
That's one thing to do.

45
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,030
And then also I give a recommendation

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,970
to go look at social media fails.

47
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,073
That's the cost of not knowing.

48
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,920
And there are ways that you
can get it around this, right?

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,930
There are ways that you can address this.

50
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,280
And so for those of you that may

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,620
or may not be familiar with Qlik,

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,579
I wanted to just share
briefly about what we do,

53
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,250
and why it's important

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,919
to help you address the
cost of not knowing.

55
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,830
So in a world where I don't
think anybody in the room

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,350
would say, we don't
have enough data, right?

57
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,930
Does anybody really feel we
don't have an enough data?

58
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,730
Everyone's struggling with that.

59
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,997
Yeah, good.

60
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,660
You have gotta be able to get access

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,230
to all of your data
regardless of where it is.

62
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,063
You need to be able to extract it,

63
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:40,289
you need to be able to move it around.

64
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:42,480
You need to be able to make it ready,

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,260
and transform it in ways that
people can understand and use.

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,790
And I say people,

67
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,313
but the reality is, is moving
forward in the agentic world,

68
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:53,460
those people may not actually be people,

69
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,860
they may be actually other agents.

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,240
So what that means is
you have to be able to

71
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,863
trust that data.

72
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,460
Beyond just trusting that data,

73
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,050
and getting it and getting it ready,

74
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,150
you need to be able to
provide it to people,

75
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,700
or agents that may want to
consume this information

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,826
and have trusted data products.

77
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,930
And then in the world
that we're living in,

78
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,180
where analyzing all of your data,

79
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,280
helps you uncover hidden patterns

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,260
and make decisions off of
that about, for example,

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,090
what color jeans do I want to wear?

82
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,740
I could even use it for that.

83
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,130
But making decisions around
where do I allocate resources?

84
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,230
How much is my forecasting looking like?

85
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,370
You need to be able to bring all of

86
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,230
that data in and analyze it.

87
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,640
But the really interesting thing,

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,972
is you wanna make
decisions off of that data

89
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:38,280
and those decisions can
be extremely strategic,

90
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,680
but they can also be really tactical.

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,512
And ultimately you want to
act and do something on it.

92
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:46,680
Anybody seen here a nice
really pretty visualization

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,900
and just say, wow, that's really pretty.

94
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,880
But if you don't do
anything with that data

95
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,130
and Juan, you'll talk about
this when you come up,

96
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,020
that's absolutely critical.

97
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,150
So this is what we do fundamentally.

98
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,580
And there are three things
that we really do well,

99
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,950
like two, three things we really do.

100
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,090
Trusted data products.

101
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,730
We can get all of your data
regardless of where it sits,

102
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,170
and make it available to an
agent or person regardless.

103
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,003
And it's trusted.

104
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,840
So you know that whatever
decisions are being made,

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,600
you can have confidence
and we can prove that.

106
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,270
The second thing we do is
we actually find patterns

107
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,400
in that data that you will not find

108
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,350
with a pure visualization vendor.

109
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,030
It is impossible to do.

110
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,127
We have technology that
allows you to do that.

111
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:28,140
And the third thing that we do uniquely

112
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,310
is how you act on that.

113
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,001
When you combine trusted data products

114
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,827
with the ability to combine this,

115
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:36,330
you can act on it with more confidence.

116
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,790
We're starting to see in the
world that we grew up in,

117
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,680
for those of you anybody
have BI experience

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,480
or reporting experience in the room.

119
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,552
Yeah, right? Our world is
getting rocked here, isn't it?

120
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:50,552
It is not 2002 where someone
wants a pixel perfect report.

121
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,944
What we are hearing from our customers,

122
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:57,277
is we are hearing that
they expect their analytics

123
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:01,230
to become more of an
agentic intelligence layer.

124
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,140
That they built all of this IP,

125
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,360
and now they want to be
able to take advantage

126
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,220
of it in an agentic way.

127
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,780
And if any of you're Qlik customers,

128
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,814
please come by our booth
and we'll help show you

129
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:14,100
and understand how you can do that.

130
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,420
The second thing we're
seeing in the agentic world,

131
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,330
is data infrastructure.

132
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,420
The data you need to run
an agentic framework.

133
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,376
The data you need to make
decisions in agentic framework,

134
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,460
it is growing at rates that I don't think

135
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,970
any of us expected, even in the back

136
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,430
in the big data days, right?

137
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,310
It is growing way faster than
any of us would've expected.

138
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,335
It needs to be available,
it needs to be fast,

139
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,320
it needs to be performant
and it can't bankrupt you.

140
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,722
So we're starting to see customers

141
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:45,120
that are really struggling with that.

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,700
And then finally, we've been
talking in the BI space,

143
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,400
in the analytics space for 20, 25 years.

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,540
It is about what you do with it.

145
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,150
We are starting to see
more and more automation.

146
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,281
That's not a request anymore.

147
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:58,800
That's in fact a requirement for any of us

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,033
that are in this space.

149
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,540
But the challenges remain.

150
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,050
The challenges remain. Trusted data.

151
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,480
I never thought I'd be
standing here in 2025

152
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,150
and saying data quality
initiatives are important,

153
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,700
and are really exciting again.

154
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,370
Customers are struggling with that.

155
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,820
The cost. I talked about
having the data available

156
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,653
where you want.

157
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:23,370
Adaptability, and being able to do it

158
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,810
in a cost effective manner

159
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,893
remains to be a challenge
for our customers.

160
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:31,080
And then finally, the
ability to have all of that

161
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,550
information whenever
you need it, rely on it,

162
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,520
so you can act on it and automate
a lot of those decisions.

163
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,546
Customers are still
struggling with all three

164
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,600
of these things and
not just our customers.

165
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,633
Everybody out there that
we speak to is doing that.

166
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,643
I have good news.

167
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:52,650
I have a customer who's addressed
a lot of these challenges.

168
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,520
And the story that you'll
hear from Ingersoll Rand here

169
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,790
in just a moment,

170
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,770
will be talking about many of these things

171
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,380
that we just talked about,

172
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,780
talk about it in a way
that is not a vendor

173
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,580
telling you how it's going to work,

174
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,590
but the real world example.

175
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,293
And I think the thing that I'm
hoping you'll walk away from

176
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:13,680
this session today is after
listening to Juan talk,

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,010
that if you've invested in
this analytics infrastructure,

178
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,960
this data and analytics infrastructure,

179
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,800
that there is a way forward
for you in this new world.

180
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,270
So I'd love to welcome Juan to the stage

181
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,620
from Ingersoll Rand.

182
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,793
Please come round of applause.

183
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:31,350
(audience applauding)

184
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,350
- Thank you Brenden.

185
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,976
Alright so for everyone, I
would like to make this real.

186
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:40,950
I want to mention that
for many, many years,

187
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,040
I've been sitting there
and many of the ideas

188
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,790
that I consider we have
been successful with,

189
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,237
have not been our ideas
is people like, you know,

190
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,730
that have been here, I've
been hearing inspiring,

191
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,634
and I will consider myself like successful

192
00:07:56,634 --> 00:08:01,200
if some of you may say
I'm taking home something

193
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,363
from this presentation.

194
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,170
So let's start with something, right?

195
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,890
Ingersoll Rand is a
manufacturing conglomerate,

196
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,950
multinational, very complex, right?

197
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,030
And if you think about like Ingersoll Rand

198
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,060
is more than 90 brands.

199
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,200
Now, I don't expect you
to know even one single

200
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,590
of these brands, but what
I like about this slide

201
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,310
is that it is not a corporate slide,

202
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,640
it is an IT slide. And you'll see why.

203
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,780
This is an IT slide.

204
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,397
Because if you probably
extend this to your reality,

205
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,480
you'll see behind these dozens of ERPs,

206
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,468
perhaps like 5, 6, 7 CRMs,

207
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:57,450
supply chain complexities
for every single brand,

208
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,383
decades and decades of legacy systems.

209
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,760
It's all that make us
analytic professionals,

210
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,233
managers, developers,

211
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,130
our life difficult, right?

212
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,130
It is how do we make enterprise
grade, enterprise wide AI,

213
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,050
if we have to deal with that complexity

214
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,950
and data is messy and systems are legacy,

215
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,110
and it's difficult to connect.

216
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,430
It's, look, we have more
than 50 FPs in our company

217
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,650
just to tell you that, right?

218
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,680
So when we have to deal with something

219
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,730
of like that size and
complexity in manufacturing.

220
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,880
Manufacturing data historically, you know,

221
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,650
manufacturing companies are
very data rich, but inside poor.

222
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,938
And that hurts, right?

223
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:55,800
And we have to deal with
all these complexities.

224
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,754
So when we started to see
all these like AI explosion,

225
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:05,483
we ask ourselves how can
we attack the AI problem

226
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:08,040
in our manufacturing reality, right?

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,722
Lean teams, small teams of data engineers,

228
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:16,110
of enterprise wide like analytics.

229
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,010
How can we make AI that
can compete with, you know,

230
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,970
like big muscle high technology companies?

231
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,192
And so the first thing
we did was like, alright,

232
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,610
let's divide the AI problem on one side

233
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,020
of the spectrum, right?

234
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,493
I think you are the left
side on the screen for you.

235
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,438
We said we have workplace
AI, personal use AI right?

236
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:45,420
Someone needs to push a literacy

237
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,420
and culture program that can
reach 15,000 knowledge workers.

238
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,670
This is your typical Microsoft copilot.

239
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,040
These are the small use
cases where people start

240
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,637
to get a brain muscle on prompting,

241
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:02,445
on starting to trust AI.

242
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:06,660
And we started there and
then some ambitions, right?

243
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,020
Let's build some
transformational AI projects,

244
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,080
and we go to the other
side of the spectrum,

245
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,790
enterprise custom AI.

246
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,070
And that's where my team said, hey,

247
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,436
no one in the company
will be able to create

248
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:22,470
these like complex data pipelines,

249
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,030
structured data, unstructured
data, RAG, vectorization,

250
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,830
let's transform one or two,

251
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,200
or three aspects of the company, sales,

252
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,350
field service technicians,
customer experience.

253
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,450
But we cannot take more than that, right?

254
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,840
Choose, choose one, choose
two, but don't choose 50.

255
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,090
And all the people on the other side,

256
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,375
on one side of the spectrum
started to say, yeah,

257
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:48,930
here are a hundred use cases,
we want hundred use cases.

258
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,450
What is even more like
difficult at the beginning,

259
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,230
was that the people on the personal use,

260
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,340
or workplace AI, they started
to become good at this.

261
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,260
They started to understand AI

262
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,990
and they started to think, okay,

263
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,010
now I want my small
agent to answer questions

264
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,330
about my salesforce data, my Oracle data,

265
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,330
my JD Edwards data, my SAP
data, my Infor data, right?

266
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:21,690
And at that point we
analytics team said like,

267
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,860
hold on, hold on, right?

268
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,160
Like that will require a data pipeline,

269
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,460
that will require security,
that will require curated data,

270
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,800
because otherwise this will hallucinate

271
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,118
all over the place.

272
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,016
And so there was a gap

273
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:40,016
and that gap is users
started to ask for more.

274
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,870
More complex questions,

275
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,820
real time from their data

276
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,490
that assist their daily operations.

277
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,840
And then there's another aspect there

278
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,880
that I didn't talk too much yet,

279
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,490
which is single knowledge domain,

280
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,290
for us it's just fatigue.

281
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,240
So many point solutions,

282
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,850
every vendor trying to monetize their AI,

283
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,067
so much noise or everyone wanted to become

284
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,330
a new data cloud provider,

285
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,210
a new lakehouse architecture, moving data.

286
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,600
For us, it was like a nightmare
just hearing business, hey,

287
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,940
I have this vendor, they're
solving every problem

288
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,230
with AI right?

289
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,770
And that's like the
single knowledge domain.

290
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,970
So we took that gap and we
said, what can we do about this?

291
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,440
So we came with this.

292
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
I mean this is probably
not obvious for some,

293
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,140
some may be saying we already do this,

294
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,770
but if not, this is going
to make a lot of sense.

295
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,770
And let's put in that gap
something called data platform AI,

296
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,290
internal name for this.

297
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,130
And let's think about our
medallion architecture, right?

298
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,190
We have our lakehouse
architecture with our bronze,

299
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,380
and silver and gold zone.

300
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,240
But where is our most
curated data in the company?

301
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,250
It is on that data platform.

302
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,310
It is on Qlik in our case,

303
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,243
that is working as that glue logic,

304
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:10,243
almost like connective tissue
where for years and years,

305
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,050
our analytics professionals,
analytics community,

306
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,057
data citizens, have been
putting lot of effort, time,

307
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:24,090
sweat, blood, on curating databases,

308
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,113
creating pipelines that were sustaining

309
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,890
traditional analytics.

310
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,670
And what we said is, okay,
that's our new Goldilocks zone.

311
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,660
If we can enable AI directly

312
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,647
on all these thousands of analytics assets

313
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:44,123
that have been created with
time that some of these

314
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:47,343
we are still depreciating, right?

315
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:51,960
Is going to be like pervasive AI

316
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,570
with all the complexity of custom AI,

317
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,190
but at a scale, right? Reuse the assets.

318
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,904
And so that's where we partner with Qlik

319
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:07,904
on working on the private
preview on Qlik answers,

320
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,040
and understanding like, how
can we make this a reality

321
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,760
because we are betting big on this, right?

322
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,199
Is all these assets on the platform

323
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,940
becoming conversational analytics,

324
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,826
and even better, our
data citizens community

325
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:29,826
is upskill to AI developers
at almost zero cost, right?

326
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,910
Where that's something that, you know,

327
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,630
getting talent out there is
right now like very difficult,

328
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,880
very expensive and so on.

329
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,880
So, of course we need to present
an reference architecture,

330
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,538
because probably the technical
people won't be happy

331
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:54,420
if we don't present
something that they say, hey,

332
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,860
this makes sense, this doesn't make sense.

333
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,090
It looks similar to us,

334
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,030
but this is what we are building, right?

335
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,175
We have data sources, we
have extraction layers

336
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:06,047
that are moving the data near real time.

337
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:10,711
Again the 80, 90 ERP systems, CRM systems,

338
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:13,815
we have our medallion architecture,

339
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:18,690
but then we start to see some AI factory

340
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,623
that can scale, can be replicated,

341
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:25,050
can create an economy of a
scale, is not going to create

342
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,610
an agentic nightmare of
recreating the wheel every time.

343
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,248
And that's where we start to put the MCPs

344
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:35,529
on our most curated data,

345
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,730
which are very granular by the way.

346
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,170
And that's really cool

347
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,950
because when we have
front facing application

348
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,987
that needs data from the
procurement data in Qlik,

349
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,920
or from the supply chain data,

350
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,370
or from the order management
data, if something changes,

351
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,428
we only need to go and modify
the order management data

352
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:58,800
and that's it.

353
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,110
And the MCP will make that data available

354
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,960
to whatever downstream
applications are using that

355
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,153
without us having to modify
like a humongous AI agent.

356
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:12,410
So this is creating like a very resilient,

357
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,410
reliable mesh of agents out of the box

358
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,600
because we are relying
now on data platform AI.

359
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,570
And so the use cases are there.

360
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,510
For us 20,000 hours saved on

361
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:35,148
account managers being able to
put, a year like 20,000 hours

362
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,070
more of like customer facing time

363
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,240
because they don't have to go

364
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,961
and find this information somewhere else.

365
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,120
Or their management teams in Asia Pacific

366
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,093
that had to deal before
with 5, 6, 7 CRMs or ERPs

367
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,379
to sell something now are
coming to a single dashboard

368
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,830
that makes all that complexity agnostic,

369
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,570
and asking simple questions like

370
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,730
what are my top 10 orders
that are going to miss

371
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,000
a shipping date if I don't
remove a hold, right,

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,910
in the next five days.

373
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,180
And that's starting to
change and the way we work,

374
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,763
and it's almost out of the gate, right?

375
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,284
So this is, you know,
like if someone is fan of

376
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:19,744
some of those garner presentations,

377
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:23,400
is the first time that
we finally could say

378
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,058
we are delivering on that
old promise of combining

379
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,210
all these descriptive, diagnostic,

380
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,420
predictive, prescriptive,
and perceptive analytics,

381
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,490
because in a single place,

382
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,070
because of these data platform AI process

383
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,070
supported and enabled by
platform like Qlik right?

384
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,410
So to end the presentation,

385
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,470
couple of tactical unconventional hacks.

386
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,860
The first one is again, well
everything I just mentioned,

387
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,800
the analytics platform is
your closest to AI ready data.

388
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,180
Use it, right?

389
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,960
You have invested,
again, like a lot of time

390
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,450
curating your finance, your FP,

391
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,030
and your procurement, your supply chain,

392
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,214
your demand generation,
your operations data.

393
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:17,130
Now you have like the
possibility to just plug AI

394
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,843
on top of that and make
AI pervasive across

395
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:26,610
your entire user base of analytics users.

396
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,577
Second one is your analytics super users

397
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:32,940
become your instant AI army.

398
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,170
This is really important.

399
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,844
Like, doesn't matter how
much you think about it,

400
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:41,190
you have been building a
community of data citizens

401
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,788
and professionals and
they will love to jump

402
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,730
into the AI wagon,

403
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,680
and this is giving them the opportunity.

404
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,900
Immediately you're telling them, look,

405
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,750
your skills are completely up to date.

406
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,196
The data you have curated,
the data, you know,

407
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,200
is now the fuel of agentic AI and MCPs.

408
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,050
And you own that, and that's empowerment,

409
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,861
and that creates like
an amazing engagement,

410
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:13,194
and opportunity for, you
know, superpower analytic

411
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:17,340
professionals in the
company with the, you know,

412
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,562
the hype of AI which is very real, right?

413
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:25,020
So with that, I will hand
over back to Brendan,

414
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,766
and thank you for your time.

415
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:29,933
(audience applauding)

416
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,669
- [Brenden] Is that on? There we go.

417
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,423
A couple takeaways from Juan's section,

418
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:41,820
that I think are really important

419
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,890
and I mentioned it in my first part,

420
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,518
is if you've invested in a
data and analytics layer,

421
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,470
all is not lost, right?

422
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,820
We started off with a
little fear of, you know,

423
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,250
after your history, the
reality of what you're hearing

424
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,110
from a company like Ingersoll Rand

425
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,510
where I knew you had a lot of ERPs,

426
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,101
I didn't know you had that many ERPs.

427
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:06,150
They have built this
amazing infrastructure

428
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,010
on data and analytics that
they are just going to

429
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,290
take to the next level already,

430
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,140
by opening up a few new capabilities.

431
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,900
Like MCP is a big move
forward for you, right?

432
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,470
And that investment is
there for them already.

433
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,640
That's number one.

434
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,140
Number two, and I don't
think you could have

435
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,380
said it any better, as a
former BI developer myself,

436
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,920
I ask myself the questions,
what is my role in this?

437
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,580
Our role, those of us that have
built analytic applications

438
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,214
over time, our role in it is
to become to, as you said,

439
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,790
become the AI army, right?

440
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,770
That's the core thing.

441
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,970
So as you think about
why is Ingersoll Rand

442
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,040
able to take advantage of this?

443
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,660
There are a couple pieces of the puzzle

444
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,160
that Qlik has delivered.

445
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,380
We're not their entire infrastructure.

446
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,350
We're not trying to be
their entire infrastructure.

447
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,632
We're trying to address
very specific problems

448
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:01,440
for companies like Ingersoll Rand.

449
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,437
The first one is giving
them trusted data products,

450
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:07,320
and the way they've built
their analytics applications,

451
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,900
those analytics applications,

452
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,000
they're the basis for
everything they're gonna do

453
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,492
with agentic AI because it's trusted,

454
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:16,950
and I love the Goldilocks layer.

455
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,720
That's a new expression
that I learned today,

456
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,000
but the Goldilocks layer, it's just right,

457
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,920
and it's really amazing.

458
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,410
So getting that trusted
data products in place,

459
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,140
we help them do that
with the data pipelines,

460
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,291
as Juan mentioned,

461
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,770
they can make changes
in their source systems,

462
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,754
but because of the way that we
help them manage their data,

463
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,710
they're able to know that
the downstream systems

464
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,270
and the downstream decisions
and actions were accurate.

465
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,040
So that's one thing.

466
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,410
The second thing that
we're able to help with,

467
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,950
and we really fit in is
our analytics engine.

468
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,194
That is the secret sauce for Qlik.

469
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:55,572
90 source systems sounds like a lot,

470
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:58,230
and I'm only touching on
how many source systems

471
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,063
you truly have.

472
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:02,130
The 90 ERP, this is where
our analytics engine

473
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,140
comes in extremely strong.

474
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,780
We are able to help
you bring data together

475
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,960
in a fashion that will
reduce the amount of time

476
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,440
of building your data model
somewhere between 80 and 90%.

477
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,580
It will cut down that time.

478
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,860
And then what you have,
is you have your trusted

479
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,690
data foundation for AI.

480
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,990
And then finally we are
building all of this

481
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,335
on top of an agentic framework.

482
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:26,220
For those of you that raised your hands

483
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,990
of being in the analytics and BI space,

484
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,210
this is the future, right?

485
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,521
The future unfortunately
started about a year ago

486
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,510
for all of us and we have
to catch up with that.

487
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,600
So we are really looking
at the existing set

488
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
of capabilities we've
brought to the market

489
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,000
to support extremely complex scenarios

490
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,440
like Juan spoke about.

491
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,380
And we're building it on
top of an agentic framework.

492
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,254
And the way we're really
thinking about it is,

493
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:57,254
Qlik wants to be a
portfolio of capabilities,

494
00:23:57,522 --> 00:24:01,026
that will help you understand the context

495
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:05,430
of the information you
have in all of this data.

496
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,440
We are going down a path
where we're bringing

497
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,440
assistance to you and or we
are integrating with things

498
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,892
like anthropic.

499
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:17,370
We're integrating things like copilot.

500
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,493
We're integrating with
capabilities out there

501
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:23,520
that will allow you to
interact with the secret sauce,

502
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,050
the analytics engine,

503
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,090
plus the trusted data products

504
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,270
in a way that will be natural language,

505
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,450
that your users will
feel comfortable with.

506
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,970
And that ultimately will help you target

507
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,919
very specific business challenges.

508
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,070
These assistants are designed

509
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,800
to tap into our agentic framework,

510
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,920
and have very specific tasks.

511
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,890
You'll notice here that
we're focused on data tasks,

512
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,750
or analytics tasks.

513
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,340
You're not gonna see us build an agent

514
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,020
around customer service.

515
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,810
That's not our expertise,
Juan, you know that,

516
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,580
our expertise is data and analytics.

517
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,678
So we are focusing on
bringing agents out there

518
00:25:02,678 --> 00:25:06,330
that can work with MCP
that you can interact with.

519
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,400
And then also we are going down the agent

520
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
to agent architecture approach.

521
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,830
So agents from other
systems, as Juan pointed out,

522
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,980
can interact with, say for
example, a data quality agent.

523
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,766
Hey, I'm trying to make a
decision around my supply chain

524
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:24,328
to build my shoes, my socks and my suits.

525
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:27,990
Go tell me whether or not
my data quality is correct,

526
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,180
and the agent will go off and do that.

527
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,180
We're also focusing on knowledge agents.

528
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,460
And knowledge agents are really designed

529
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,656
to help you bring that unstructured data,

530
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:40,950
which for the record is
about 85% of the data

531
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,480
in your organization.

532
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,720
Bring all of that into
a knowledge assistant

533
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,430
that will allow you to make decisions

534
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,320
off of that data without needing to build

535
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,730
your own RAG pipelines.

536
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,180
We can cut that time down by 90%.

537
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,580
And if you want to talk about
the experience that Juan

538
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,590
and team have had with Qlik answers,

539
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,140
I encourage you to talk about
the time it can save them.

540
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,426
Ultimately these agents
are designed to help

541
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:08,165
remove some of the manual tasks

542
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:11,520
and help you make more effective decisions

543
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,920
based off of this trusted architecture.

544
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,675
So regardless of what you're using,

545
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,280
whether it's a Microsoft,

546
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,580
whether you're using some of
the AWS amazing announcements

547
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,740
we've heard over the past couple of days,

548
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,410
anthropic, whatever it may be,

549
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,510
you can interact with MCP

550
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,318
and as you go down your agent framework,

551
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:31,380
we are designed to work with other

552
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,810
agentic frameworks as well.

553
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,004
We're also trying to build this
on top of an infrastructure

554
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:40,800
that is going to help
you be adaptive, right?

555
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,330
We've seen data gravity,

556
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,820
data gravity is going to be a challenge.

557
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,790
Wouldn't we all love to put
our data in one single location

558
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,980
and just have it sit there and be happy.

559
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,800
Juan, you would be super
happy if we could do that.

560
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,080
The reality of everything
you're dealing with

561
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,960
is that you need a set of capabilities

562
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,330
or portfolio of capabilities
that are adaptable

563
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,950
to the way you want to work.

564
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,160
You can have some of your
data that sits over on Azure,

565
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,961
or AWS, you can have it sit in Google,

566
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:11,550
you can have it sit in a
Databricks or Snowflake,

567
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,530
all of these locations.

568
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,110
And we have gone down
an open lakehouse path

569
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,530
with Iceberg that will help you make sure

570
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,332
that you can take advantage
of your data wherever it is.

571
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:23,910
Make sure you're adaptable.

572
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,078
You can do it in a scalable way.

573
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,380
The number that I've heard on scalability

574
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,200
on our Iceberg instance,
it was really interesting.

575
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I heard 17 million transactions per second

576
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:39,450
is what we are able to bring
through our Iceberg instance.

577
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,720
So if you think about
that type of scalability,

578
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,180
I think about the supply chains
that you have to deal with,

579
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,430
that type of scalability is incredible.

580
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,400
And we do it so we can help
you reduce your data ingress

581
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,870
and egress charges with Iceberg.

582
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,610
So we're helping you be adaptable,

583
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,840
we're helping you save money,

584
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,100
and we're trying to make
sure you're doing it

585
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,783
with trusted data infrastructure.

586
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:03,845
Look, has everybody seen
the, the MIT study out there

587
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,030
that's only 5% of AI.

588
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,760
Yeah, super. Really, really fun isn't it?

589
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,080
5% of AI initiatives have failed.

590
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,410
Our approach at Qlik and what
I'm hoping you saw from Juan,

591
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,500
and we'll open it up to
questions in a second here,

592
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,013
he is a real example
about how to be successful

593
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:24,510
with an initiative like this, right?

594
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,550
Juan is one of the 5%.

595
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,312
Our goal is to make sure that we can make

596
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:32,910
that number not 5% successful,

597
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,335
we can make almost every
customer successful.

598
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:37,950
We really want to do that.

599
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,530
So a couple things that
you need to think about,

600
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,150
what we've spoke about today.

601
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,387
And as Juan pointed out, yes,

602
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:47,070
we all love our architecture diagrams.

603
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,260
We all do, right?

604
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,605
It really lays it out for us.

605
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,740
But the reality of the situation is,

606
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,650
you have to make sure
that you have context

607
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,530
as you go down this
agentic framework, right?

608
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,200
Making decisions with all your data,

609
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,187
on top of a trusted data foundation,

610
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:07,230
and doing it in a way
that allows you to adapt

611
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,210
to where your data resides,

612
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,100
is going to be absolutely critical.

613
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,780
If you are not going down that path,

614
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,273
and thinking about decisions in context,

615
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:19,140
your initiative is likely to fail.

616
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,510
You will end up being one
of those Google searches

617
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,500
that I just spoke about.

618
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,649
So really think about context

619
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:27,933
in the framework of agentic AI.

620
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,960
The second thing, governance.

621
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,831
I mean governance has
become even more important.

622
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,125
Governance ultimately comes down to,

623
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,340
what we've seen is that,

624
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,310
feedback into these models is critical.

625
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,500
One of the things that
we've noticed with customers

626
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,816
that have been successful in deploying

627
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:49,166
our unstructured data assistant already,

628
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:53,250
is that they give constant
feedback into their models,

629
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,890
and they give constant feedback
with trusted information

630
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,830
and they govern that information.

631
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,410
It allows them to ensure
that whatever answers

632
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,910
they are they're getting

633
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,350
and whatever decisions they're making,

634
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,930
that it has been through
a feedback mechanism.

635
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,154
And I am blatantly and
shamelessly stealing the AI army

636
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:13,950
concept here because you've
gotta let that AI army

637
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,611
be those people that help
you govern that data,

638
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:20,910
govern those models and
help govern your decisions.

639
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,040
Those of us in the BI and analytics space,

640
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,720
we're the experts in that data.

641
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,830
We know it, right?

642
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,238
So it's one of those things
that you can really do.

643
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:29,910
The other thing is,

644
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,820
and I'm gonna make a fairly
controversial statement here,

645
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,800
as an analytics vendor,

646
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,563
who has made their career
on building dashboards.

647
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,380
That world is gone.

648
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,950
It is not the world that we grew up in.

649
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,558
Analytics as a destination, as a portal,

650
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:50,430
is no longer going to be acceptable.

651
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,827
And if you go back to Juan's markitecture

652
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:56,190
and architecture diagram,
I loved across the top,

653
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,010
you literally have every generative AI

654
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,216
and agentic tool across the top there.

655
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:03,613
That's the world we're living in now.

656
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:07,800
Everything that we do
from a data and analytics

657
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,379
and decision making process,

658
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:14,550
has got to be embedded within
your business processes.

659
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,500
We're at a point where the digital natives

660
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,404
are entering the workforce
and our successful customers

661
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:23,578
are really focusing on
helping this workforce

662
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:27,325
who grew up with mobile phones, iPads,

663
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:31,440
and asking Siri to make them breakfast.

664
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,260
That's the world we're living
in, in this generative AI.

665
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,454
So as you think about that,

666
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:39,480
really ensure that you're
going to embed everything

667
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,680
into your workflows.

668
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,870
Ultimately, Juan, I would
imagine you probably

669
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,420
consider it success
almost if they don't know

670
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,280
they're using your AI capabilities,

671
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,470
'cause if they know, that means
there was an outage, right?

672
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,000
That's usually the bad news.

673
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,410
But you want to make it embedded.

674
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,330
Your supply chain
manager should just think

675
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,860
they're running their supply chain.

676
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,170
Your marketing operations
lead should just think

677
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,953
they're optimizing their campaign.

678
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:02,790
Analytics is going to
become part of an AI,

679
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,269
is going to become part
of everything we do.

680
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,352
So consider that.

681
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:11,160
And then finally, these
three things combined,

682
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,338
will help make sure
that you have the right

683
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:17,790
enterprise approach in
having the enterprise

684
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,928
grade AI strategy that will
allow you to get there.

685
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:23,252
What I really want you
to walk away from is not

686
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:25,710
necessarily what we at Qlik have to say,

687
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,230
but really listen to Juan's story, right?

688
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,360
He has an amazing foundation.

689
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,474
He has amazing organization
that backs him up on this,

690
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:36,990
and the proof is in the pudding.

691
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,310
I actually did a little research

692
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,239
on some of the business
results for Ingersoll Rand.

693
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,160
Just encourage you to go look
at their business results,

694
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
because the results that they're seeing,

695
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,046
is the results of what we
just talked about here today.

696
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:52,740
I actually wanted to end
this in about 30 minutes.

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,573
I know it was for an hour.

698
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:54,630
I wanted to give some time to see

699
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,700
if there are any
questions for Juan and me.

700
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,890
Juan, I'd love to bring you back up.

701
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,723
Thank you.
