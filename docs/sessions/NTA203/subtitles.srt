1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,290
- Hi, everyone. Welcome to re:Invent 2025.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,770
For those that are experiencing
re:Invent for the first time,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,770
you're in for a incredible week
of learning and innovation.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,250
Quick show of hands, how
many of you have experienced

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,793
Agentic AI solutions in your
workplace or daily life?

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,890
Okay, so that's about a
third of the 150 so people

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,990
that are in this room.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,020
And how many of you have
wondered about the architecture

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,873
or implementation behind
those experiences?

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,023
Okay, about about 25%.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,350
The adoption of Agentic AI
has truly been remarkable.

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,320
At AWS, we've been privileged
to witness our customers

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,210
across industries rapidly
innovating these solutions

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,910
to solve complex business challenges

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,790
and create transformative
customer experiences

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,840
to solve complex business challenges

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,080
and create transformative
customer experiences, sorry.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,380
However, this accelerated pace has brought

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,950
significant challenges from
architectural decisions

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,450
to production implementation,

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,180
and industry-specific considerations.

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,000
That's exactly why we've
designed today's session.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,720
We'll share insights into
how different industries

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,370
are leveraging Agentic AI,

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,040
explore common architectural patterns,

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,836
and provide guidance on

27
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:31,590
how moving from pilot
projects to production.

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,590
We'll also examine how application
development is evolving

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,390
in the era of Agentic AI.

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,170
My name is Eric Espeseth, I
lead the solution architect team

31
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,450
for enterprise customers
in the United States,

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,210
for customers that are new to AWS.

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,470
I'm pleased to be joined on
the stage by Akhil Melakunta,

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,660
who's a senior solutions architect.

35
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,030
Jey Vell, a senior SA leader,

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,743
and Kalpana Mahesh, who is a
Agentic AI specialist leader.

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,890
Let me quickly walk you
through what we'll cover today.

38
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,740
We'll start with an executive
outlook on Agentic AI,

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,860
focused on the healthcare
vertical and several use cases

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,080
where our healthcare
customers are transforming

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,330
the patient care experience.

42
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,120
Then Akhil will dive into
the Agentic AI architecture

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,450
guidance and provide examples
of how customers in the retail

44
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,970
and e-commerce vertical
are leveraging Agentic AI

45
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,760
to transform the customer experience.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,460
Jey will follow by exploring
the path to production

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,100
with financial service focused view.

48
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,560
To close out the session,
Kalpana will walk us through

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,410
the innovations of the
AI development lifecycle,

50
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,900
focusing on how to learn,

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,030
how learn and adapting the processes

52
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,083
and what's on the horizon in this space.

53
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,970
A common question we get
from our customers is,

54
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,550
should I be replacing
my Agentic AI efforts,

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,520
my Gen AI efforts with Agentic AI?

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,620
The short answer is no.

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,530
We like to say that
Agentic AI is an evolution

58
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,813
in the AI space in general.

59
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,510
Gen AI and Agentic AI are
complimentary technologies,

60
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,160
and that's because they are different,

61
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,903
they serve different purposes.

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,060
As an AWS customer, think
about how you either have used

63
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,923
or consider using Gen AI.

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,380
So for common use cases
and summarize information,

65
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,580
generate content or visualizations,
conduct translations,

66
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,780
or those sorts of things.

67
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,750
All of those are still fantastic use cases

68
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,800
for Generative AI,

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,320
and we still encourage
our customers to generate,

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,873
use Generative AI for
those types of outcomes.

71
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,130
Agentic AI is similar but different.

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,710
The primary purpose of
Agentic AI applications

73
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,900
is to complete specific task.

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,270
We're talking about
solving complex problems,

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,610
similar to the ones that humans solve,

76
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,650
particularly when the
outcomes of those decisions

77
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,190
are subjective and involve
talking to large amounts

78
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,203
of data from various systems.

79
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,660
Now, let's dive a bit
deeper into the difference

80
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,640
between Generative AI and Agentic AI

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,650
in the healthcare space.

82
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,540
Customers have been using Generative AI

83
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,120
for use cases like chatbots
in patient experience

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,500
and digital health.

85
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,280
In this domain, chatbots
provide self-service care triage

86
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,430
with proactive communication
and patient care guidance.

87
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,830
They also generate
patient friendly reports

88
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,950
and post-discharge care guidance.

89
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,780
Similarly, in care management,

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,350
Generative AI has been
effective in summarizing records

91
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,930
for registries and analyzing patient level

92
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,050
and cohort level records to identify risk.

93
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,970
It has also proved valuable in segmenting

94
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,223
patient populations for interventions.

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,070
In medical research and education,

96
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,590
Generative AI has been
instrumental in solving

97
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,930
clinical trial patient matching,

98
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,880
summarizing research publications,

99
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,620
and providing self-service Q&A

100
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,870
for medical reference documents.

101
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,810
We have observed Generative
AI outcomes boosting

102
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,300
research efforts by
automating data cleansing

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,340
and enabling cross patient queries

104
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,100
to identify clinical trial matches.

105
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,190
This diagram illustrates how Generative AI

106
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,740
powered by large language models or LLMs

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,960
integrate with various
healthcare data sources

108
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,120
to achieve these outcomes.

109
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,590
Now, let's see where agent AI

110
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,273
is being effective in healthcare.

111
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,740
In intelligent patient experience,

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,830
we're moving beyond basic
chatbots to autonomous agents

113
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,400
that actively coordinate
across multiple systems.

114
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Pulling data from EHR, lab
results, image repositories

115
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,590
and scheduling systems to
create truly personalized

116
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,743
patient journeys without
constant human intervention.

117
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,980
For hospital staff productivity,

118
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,010
multi-agent systems
now autonomously manage

119
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,720
the entire clinical workflows

120
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,880
intelligently allocating resources based

121
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,420
on real-time conditions, and
even predict staffing needs

122
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,880
before the shortages impact care delivery,

123
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,123
fundamentally reducing
administrative burden on clinicians.

124
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,700
In supply chain optimization,

125
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,430
agents continually
monitor inventory levels

126
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,120
across facilities, predict
demand patterns using historical

127
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,700
and contextual data on
autonomously trigger

128
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,310
procurement workflows when needed,

129
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,630
eliminating manual oversight
of routine supply management.

130
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,550
What makes this truly transformative

131
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,970
is the agent orchestration
layer shown in the middle.

132
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,410
Unlike traditional Gen AI

133
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,570
that makes recommendations
in a single domain

134
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,630
requiring human approval,
these agents work together

135
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,200
across multiple domains,
making autonomous decisions

136
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,083
and executing actions in real time.

137
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,120
This orchestration layer
enables the shift from reactive

138
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,690
to proactive healthcare
operations, fundamentally changing

139
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,403
how healthcare systems function.

140
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,120
Looking at these diverse industries,

141
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,063
we can see a landscape rich
with untapped potential.

142
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,180
Each sector presents unique challenges

143
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,530
that this agentic technology

144
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,810
is uniquely positioned to address.

145
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,790
The opportunities extend far beyond

146
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,010
what we will discuss today.

147
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,500
Executives are already
having their teams working

148
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,020
on these outcomes for various industries.

149
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,460
What's particularly exciting

150
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,200
is how these solutions can be tailored

151
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,690
to industry specific needs and use cases

152
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,903
while leveraging common
technological foundations.

153
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,870
The most innovative organizations

154
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,000
are already exploring these frontiers,

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,630
creating competitive advantages
through novel applications.

156
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,960
The question isn't whether
these opportunities exist,

157
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,450
but rather which organizations
will move quickly

158
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,730
to capture them and
define the next generation

159
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,173
of industry solutions.

160
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,150
While these opportunities are compelling,

161
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,090
successful implementation
isn't guaranteed.

162
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,803
As we can see here,
Gartner projected over 40%

163
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:06,480
of Agentic AI projects will fail by 2027

164
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,300
due to escalating cost,
unclear business value

165
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,550
or inadequate risk controls.

166
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,340
This is precisely why
the rest of this session

167
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,310
we have focused on taking
a strategic approach,

168
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,700
keeping the value model at the center,

169
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,650
and offering available solutions on AWS

170
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,613
to achieve agentic outcomes
at enterprise scale.

171
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,087
And what is our vision
for Agentic AI on AWS.

172
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:36,150
AWS's vision is to be
the best place to build

173
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,610
and deploy the world's most trusted

174
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,310
and useful agents, enabling organizations

175
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,580
to reimagine their
business with Agentic AI.

176
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,590
We at AWS are working with customers

177
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,260
to transform these ideas into agents,

178
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,860
complexity into autonomy
and effort into outcomes,

179
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,660
empowering organizations to deploy

180
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,363
secure, reliable Agentic AI at scale.

181
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,680
Now, Akhil will walk you through
the architectural guidance

182
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,640
to build complete Agentic
AI solutions with retail

183
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,163
and consumer packaged
goods industry focus.

184
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,043
- Thank you, Eric. Great insights.

185
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,970
To understand a well-rounded
architectural guidance

186
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,100
when you're building agentic solutions,

187
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,500
it is important to start
off by understanding

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,080
what it takes for an
agent to be functioning,

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,560
different approaches to use
agents for different use cases,

190
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,990
and what are the common
patterns when you try to combine

191
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,360
multiple agents to
accomplish a task for you.

192
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,410
So let's get started.

193
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,170
So the next part of this session,

194
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,750
I'll be using retail and e-commerce CPG

195
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,210
as an industry example
to share my point of view

196
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,740
on architectural guidance.

197
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,280
So you can understand to help,
you know, technical aspects

198
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,100
to your real world examples
and most of the examples

199
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,710
and aspects that we talk
here, you can go back

200
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,443
and even map it to your
respective industries as well.

201
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,690
So what makes an agent function?

202
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,550
What are the basic functions for agent

203
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,173
to be performing, right?

204
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,193
So at the core of it, agent
uses an LLM for reasoning.

205
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,710
To start off, when you design an agent,

206
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,903
it is important to set
a goal for an agent.

207
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,256
An example for a goal can be this agent

208
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:21,780
is a customer service agent,

209
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,060
supposed to solve a
query within two minutes

210
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,500
within an average customer
satisfaction rate of 4.5.

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,630
That can be a goal for you to start off.

212
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,720
It is also important for
agents to have access to tools.

213
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,910
MCP servers are best example,

214
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,463
so you can extend
capabilities of your agents.

215
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,600
Memory is also very critical
for accuracy and performance.

216
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,760
You want your more both short term

217
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,070
and long term memory
accessibility to your agents,

218
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,490
so your agents can both
store recent conversations

219
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,930
and also results achieved

220
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,123
for faster performance and accuracy.

221
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,840
And at enterprise scale, it
is critical for your agents

222
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,300
to be able to access your enterprise data.

223
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,170
So you can have your
agents solve the problems

224
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,770
that are very specific to your business.

225
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,220
Unlike any software system,
it is important for agent

226
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,840
to have an end-to-end observability

227
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,430
and guardrails built on it,

228
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,470
so you're continuously
monitoring the performance

229
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,843
and how agents are
operating for your business.

230
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,600
So now, let's take a look at how,

231
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,360
and with a basic agent
can help solve a problem

232
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,070
in a retail space.

233
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,960
So let's say a retail e-commerce customer

234
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,600
is trying to build a purchase system

235
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,940
where they're trying
to address a user input

236
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,740
and this user has asked a
question about a specific product,

237
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,470
which most likely means
they're trying to purchase it.

238
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,720
Can one agent that we just spoke about

239
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,230
with all the basic agentic
functions solve this problem?

240
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,340
Definitely, yes.

241
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,700
But is it performant enough
that you're tasking single agent

242
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,900
to do all the work?

243
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,070
In this case, you would want
to look up who the customer is.

244
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,680
Do you have that product in the inventory?

245
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,810
What is the nearest store to purchase?

246
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,660
These are multiple, you know,
steps from a single prompt

247
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,030
that you're expecting the agent to solve.

248
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,100
Does it make sense for one agent to do it

249
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,100
or a series of agents
helping this one single agent

250
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,540
to do it in parallel, right?

251
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,160
It's just more performant.

252
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,310
You want that agent to
go look up the customer,

253
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,710
authenticate them, look up your inventory,

254
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,930
whether if you have that product.

255
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,990
Do you have any promotion
going on for the same user?

256
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,850
Or you know, and then
what is the nearest store

257
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,350
that they can go and purchase?

258
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,740
When all of these agents are in action,

259
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,140
a well-rounded response
would look like this.

260
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,420
You have authenticated who the user is,

261
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,340
given them a recommendation,

262
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,640
some promotion that is
very specific to that user,

263
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,763
and then a nearest store
for a better experience.

264
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,200
So that is the pattern
that we have seen customers

265
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,680
using agents so far,
more reactive in nature.

266
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,040
You know, people doesn't like
chatbots so much anymore.

267
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,580
But we have seen a
foundational shift in how

268
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,670
the customers are using agents now.

269
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,590
They're moved on from reactive agents

270
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,320
to more proactive and autonomous agents.

271
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,910
So autonomous or proactive
agents are act on their own,

272
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,760
doesn't wait for a user
input like a reactive agent.

273
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,150
So you are, you know,
pricing is a best example

274
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,860
to understand autonomous agents

275
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,200
because if you're trying to
dynamically price products

276
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,140
for your platform, it would
make sense for your agent

277
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,850
to act autonomously, right?

278
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,460
But still, if you're from
a retail space, you know,

279
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,180
pricing is not as simple as
one agent can do this task.

280
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,960
Oftentimes, our customers
have teams of people

281
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,150
accomplishing pricing challenges.

282
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,270
So this is usually a team that would bring

283
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,000
a pricing strategy to a platform.

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,910
Now, to understand
multi-agent collaboration.

285
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,670
What if we solve this
problem using multiple agents

286
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,250
coming together, right?

287
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,960
So before we get into understanding

288
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,820
multi-agent collaboration,

289
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,040
let's start with a basic understanding

290
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,500
of how agents communicate with each other.

291
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,230
So for agents to
communicate with each other,

292
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,410
agents use what's called
an Agent2Agent protocol.

293
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,320
It is an open standard protocol for agents

294
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,060
to create an abstract layer

295
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,800
when they communicate
with each other, right?

296
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,770
So this protocol solves the basic problem

297
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,990
of interoperability between agents.

298
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,570
So no matter what framework
you develop an agent,

299
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,430
another team within your organization,

300
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,040
another agent can talk to
it without understanding

301
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,530
what is actually happening
within your agent.

302
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,140
So this protocol actually facilitates

303
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,270
transport agnostic communication.

304
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,440
So whether it is a HTTP with
a JSON-RPC sample request,

305
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,040
or for a gRPC request for
high performance use cases,

306
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,860
or a simple rest method
for web applications,

307
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,660
you can use this protocol to
communicate between agents.

308
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,940
So now, let's understand
going back to the pricing

309
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,110
platform challenge, right?

310
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,060
So my pricing platform challenge,

311
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,070
I have my market intelligence team.

312
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,650
So I would want to design
my market intelligence team

313
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,410
with an orchestrator agent
that sits on the top,

314
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,420
that can use multiple agents

315
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,730
who are specialists in their own domain.

316
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,470
So for my market intelligence,

317
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,800
I want another agent acting
as a competitor price scraper

318
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,530
going out and looking
up for competitor prices

319
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,560
and making, you know, helping
my orchestrator agent.

320
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,590
So in this case, if I'm trying
to price a specific product,

321
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,340
I want my orchestrator agent
to use multiple other agents

322
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,290
that specialize in their own task

323
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,420
and call them as a callable functions,

324
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,400
almost use them as tools.

325
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,730
So in this pattern of
using other agents as tools

326
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,470
is called agents as tools.

327
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,870
It's a common pattern
that we see customers use.

328
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,290
Now, let's look at how would you want

329
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,450
to dynamically price your customers.

330
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,870
So I want my agents in
for this specific use case

331
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,470
to be able to segment my
customers based on their historic

332
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,450
history of, you know, number of purchases

333
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,740
that they have made.

334
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,200
So if somebody made more
than a thousand units,

335
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,960
I want that customer to
be segmented in a way that

336
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,380
that request is routed to
a volume discount agent.

337
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,310
So where the notes of the
agents are deciding the path

338
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,380
of the communication between agents,

339
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,290
this pattern is called
dynamic customer pricing.

340
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,810
So if you have a use
case that would require

341
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,884
your agent notes to decide
how you want to communicate

342
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:20,970
between your agents,

343
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,870
this pattern is better suited for you.

344
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,790
Now, about actually approving those prices

345
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,873
that you have determined with, you know,

346
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,910
with the analysis so far.

347
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,010
So when we strategize approving changes,

348
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,830
I would want my agents to act like peers.

349
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,320
I want them sharing a
common knowledge base.

350
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,450
I want them sharing a common memory

351
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,850
where they're making their
decisions based off it

352
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,850
and sharing those decisions
back to the other agent as well.

353
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,270
In this case, all the agents here

354
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,920
are sharing a common memory

355
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,500
and they're sharing their
decisions back into that space

356
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,800
and acting as peers, not making a decision

357
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,153
in a hierarchical fashion.

358
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,387
Now, with that changes being,
you know, approved with,

359
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,150
you know, this flow,

360
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,540
how would I push those
changes into my platform?

361
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,950
Pushing changes into platform

362
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,610
is more deterministic in nature.

363
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,440
I would have my base cost agent

364
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,020
determine what is the
base cost of a product.

365
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,780
Now, with all the analysis
that we have, you know,

366
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,060
drawn from all the analysis
with all the other agents,

367
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,710
I would have my market position of

368
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,690
how I want to price that product.

369
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,420
Now, once that is done, I
would want to apply those rules

370
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,820
to actually push those
changes and validate them

371
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,140
before I do that.

372
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,850
This is very deterministic in nature

373
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,270
where one agent is
operating, getting an output

374
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,880
and sending that as an
input to a second agent.

375
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,140
So for any use cases

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,630
where you have a very
deterministic workflow,

377
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,880
you can use what's called
a workflow pattern.

378
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,120
Return order management
is another best example

379
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,360
in this space where the
workflows are very pretty defined

380
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,430
of what happens in a sequential fashion

381
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,080
and workflow pattern better
suits in those use cases.

382
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,000
Now, let's bring
everything together, right?

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,450
So we have this multiple teams

384
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,710
using different patterns together,
solving a complex problem

385
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,460
for an autonomous proactive
agent to strategically price

386
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,790
for a price items for a retail customer.

387
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,470
Here is the critical insight.

388
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,380
These patterns are not mutual
mutually exclusive, right?

389
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,900
In real world, when we
work with customers,

390
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,240
oftentimes it is a composite architecture

391
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,980
that our customers adopt.

392
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,780
Even in this specific case,

393
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,440
I can have my dynamic pricing agent flow,

394
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,690
use a graph pattern, but even within that,

395
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,000
I can have each individual agent calling

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,560
other agents as tools.

397
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,630
So it is oftentimes a
composite architecture

398
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,800
that will work for you.

399
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,440
So just, you know, you have to come up

400
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,090
with an architecture that is better suit,

401
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,730
that better suits your business case.

402
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,640
Most customers with that level
of architectural guidance

403
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,430
will get to a very
successful pilots, right?

404
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,280
So pilots, when they try
to move to production,

405
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,400
a whole new set of
challenges starts to arise.

406
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,330
So Jey is now going to take
us into his next section

407
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,180
where he'll walk us through
his view on path to production

408
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,590
and how we can accelerate it.

409
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,423
Jey?

410
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,463
- Thank you, Akhil. Welcome.

411
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,520
Path to production.

412
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,930
We are going to cover
a couple of things in

413
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,370
as part of the path to production,

414
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,780
we are to start business value model,

415
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,600
production challenges,
some of the guardrails

416
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,550
to avoid those production challenges

417
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,350
and some of the matrix
to do the evaluation

418
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,150
of your production workload.

419
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,123
That said, I am Jey Vell,
this is path to production.

420
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,640
You'll see this pattern
that's happening now.

421
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,250
We are talking about different vertical.

422
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,140
Here I'm talking about finance vertical.

423
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,480
Raise your hands if you're
from the finance vertical

424
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,080
or something to do with finance.

425
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,750
Amazing, around 20% of the
population. Awesome, good.

426
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,350
And the 40% stat, again, this
is something from Gartner.

427
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,350
Gartner predicts by 2027, 40%
of the finance institutions

428
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,903
going to use AI agents to
automate their workflows.

429
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,390
So that's it. Let's see where
to start and when to start.

430
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,180
Start right now and where to start.

431
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,910
It's always good to start
with the business problem.

432
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,820
Talk with your business
owners, line up business owners

433
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,980
and ask them what's the
business problem they have.

434
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,740
And then from there
onwards, look backwards

435
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,110
to meet that business
need and build a pilot

436
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,780
and then you can move into production.

437
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,310
We talk about the business value.

438
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,250
Let's see how to build a
business value, a value model.

439
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,220
And I'm gonna walk you
through a framework here.

440
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,750
In the end, you can take a screenshot.

441
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,420
Again, here, I'm gonna talk
about some of the cost elements,

442
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,490
also some of the returns.

443
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,170
And then we can see the ROI.

444
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,940
Then we can take this to a CFO

445
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,770
or any of the line of business owners

446
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,093
and get their sponsorship.

447
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,950
So when you build a any
agent, first of all,

448
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,340
the first cost is coming
from the model API access.

449
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,430
Akhil clearly explain you like
even for any agent to run,

450
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,720
you don't have the LLM large
language model behind it.

451
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,140
To access that, there'll be
a cost involved, it's 25%.

452
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,210
The next cost is model optimization.

453
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,850
Imagine you are running a
model, you get some good output,

454
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,560
now you want to fine tune the model

455
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
and then now you wanna do more work.

456
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,400
So that's where this cost comes from.

457
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,350
Another one where to run these models,

458
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,580
you need infrastructure.

459
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,920
That's where this cost is coming from.

460
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,500
The next one, this is very
important, data strategy.

461
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,810
What is the key difference

462
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,940
between an agent versus Gen AI.

463
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,950
Agentic AI agent versus Gen AI.

464
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,020
You can use your own data with agents

465
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,990
and again, how to use your
data, where the data exists

466
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,820
and what transformation you do.

467
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,673
All these things come as
part of this data strategy.

468
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,880
Next one is talent slash development.

469
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,660
Again here, your development
team slash how to coach them

470
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,490
and upskill them.

471
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,440
All these things come as per this cost.

472
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,270
Last but not least, operations
and support and ethical AI.

473
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,410
Again, in the financial industry, GDPR

474
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,400
or in the healthcare, HIPAA,
all this comes together.

475
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,230
How to build those governance patterns

476
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,400
as part of this model?

477
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,080
And that's going to cost you.

478
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,790
So this is some of the cost model,

479
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,610
but then let's dive into
the return or revenue part.

480
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,343
Again, there's some direct
and indirect revenue.

481
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,950
The direct revenues could be,

482
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,313
think about you have some
agents, you charge each agent.

483
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:22,800
When you access, you charge per access.

484
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,730
That's one way of charging
or getting some revenue back.

485
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,890
The end of the one is you may also have

486
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,960
the subscription model,
like, you know, for a month,

487
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,790
I'm gonna charge, we are
gonna charge this much.

488
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,260
That's the end of the way of getting

489
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,090
direct revenue from agents.

490
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,980
There are some indirect revenue.

491
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,760
Like for an example, if
the sales revenue goes up

492
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,000
because of these agents,
that's called indirect revenue.

493
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,150
Then on top of all these
things, there are some returns

494
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,690
that you may put a dollar
quantity on top of it,

495
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,130
but they're very valuable.

496
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,980
For an example, enhanced
customer experience.

497
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,680
Imagine you put a bot on your website

498
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,660
and customers go there and ask a question.

499
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,370
They get a really solid response.

500
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,530
Now, customers love your app.

501
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,510
Right there, you increase
the customer experience.

502
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,700
Another one is boost employee productivity

503
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,420
or especially think about
like a call center agent,

504
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,500
actual human being.

505
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,010
They have a AI agent next to
them and they ask a question

506
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,810
and they understand the person calling,

507
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,010
but calling is what they need

508
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,210
and what they had in the past,

509
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,460
so now, they can make a
really good recommendation.

510
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,640
That's how we boost the
employee productivity, right?

511
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,800
So all these come under returns.

512
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,210
Now, what's going to happen?

513
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,573
We have this cost and the returns.

514
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:36,510
Now, we can find the ROI,
create a business case

515
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,410
and propose that to our CFO
or other business owners,

516
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,360
so we can get the business sponsorship.

517
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,630
So now, I'm going to walk you
through a sample use case.

518
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,120
Again, this may vary
customers to customers,

519
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,100
but I'm giving you a sample example

520
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,900
what we observed in the past.

521
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,020
For any given scenario,
we have some assumption.

522
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,670
This is a, I'm picking up an example

523
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,960
from the finance vertical,

524
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,030
like an investment advisory agent.

525
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,260
For that agent, imagine you
have 10,000 queries per day.

526
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,350
This is for both human agent and bots.

527
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,350
In that, we have 50% of the
volume being handled by bots.

528
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,510
Now, imagine the human cost is,

529
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,880
I'm just putting a number
here, $30 per hour,

530
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,170
but then bots, obviously
cheap, 10 cents per query.

531
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,440
If that's the case, what's the ROI?

532
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,090
The ROI is 10.8 million annual
savings plus some new trades.

533
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,920
What that means?

534
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,760
As we use these agents, you
can scale out and scale in

535
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,590
so that there will be some new trades.

536
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,420
Plus, there'll be some cost reduction.

537
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,960
You can see that obviously,
agent cost is very low,

538
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,710
so there'll be some cost reduction,

539
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,790
plus some customer experience.

540
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,100
Think about that again,
bot or even customers

541
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,170
are directly talking
with the bot of agents.

542
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,030
They'll get some better experience,

543
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,070
so your CSAT score goes up.

544
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,013
Plus, new customer
conversion also goes up.

545
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,400
Finally, employee productivity.

546
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,280
Like again, this could be
coming from call center agents

547
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,390
or even developers.

548
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,280
If you put some tools
with your developers,

549
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,820
when they write a quote,
their productivity can go up.

550
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,610
Plus some, you can also give the employees

551
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,770
so that human beings, some complex tasks.

552
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,780
Agent can do the mundane tasks.

553
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,690
So this is sample business
model we build, right?

554
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,670
So imagine you build this business model

555
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,850
and with Akhil's guidance,
we build a nice pilot.

556
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,630
So what is next? We need
to move to production.

557
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,790
So before we get into
the actual production,

558
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,620
I want to walk you through
some of the challenges

559
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,920
that you face in actual production itself.

560
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,010
So you have the pilot ready,
what's the first challenge

561
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,780
especially in the finance industry?

562
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,010
Performance.

563
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,810
We have millions of transactions

564
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,600
and we need them in millisecond timeframe.

565
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,900
How do we get that? That's
the biggest challenge.

566
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,120
What's the next one? Scalability.

567
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,850
Between 8:00 to 5:00,
especially in the trading floor,

568
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,580
agents should go up and in
the evenings it can come down.

569
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,500
How to build that?

570
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
Next one, security.

571
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,640
Each and every agent may
have its own security,

572
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,940
but then how to establish a
security between those agents.

573
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,943
Underlying data, all
this come as a challenge.

574
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,580
Another one is context.

575
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,413
This is very important,

576
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:17,280
especially in the agentic workflow, right?

577
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,190
One agent may have some context,
it may need to understand.

578
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,020
And then when customer
talk with the agent,

579
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,280
they may give some basic context,

580
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,820
but they don't have complete
information about the customer.

581
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,980
But then how do you go
and find other information

582
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,830
so it can give a customer
a concise response?

583
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,440
That's one of the biggest challenge.

584
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,590
And then this is the
important part, governance.

585
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,560
Again, we talk about
all these GDPR, HIPAA,

586
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,393
all these things.

587
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,260
How to build a concise governance model

588
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,610
across all the agents?

589
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,180
So these are some of the
biggest challenges we face

590
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,220
across Agentic AI applications.

591
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,310
But then in the Agentic AI agents world,

592
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,500
there are some specific challenge.

593
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,273
That's called agent silos.

594
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,320
Raise your hands if you
heard about agent silos.

595
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,120
Wow, around five, 10%. That's awesome.

596
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,360
So I'm going to explain you
what is agent silos first,

597
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,460
but then we can get into the agent silos,

598
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,233
some of the challenges.

599
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,570
So again, if you think

600
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,240
about the financial trading flow, right?

601
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,160
There'll be a market analysis agent,

602
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,020
there could be a trading execution agent,

603
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,640
there could be a risk management agent,

604
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,350
and there's the actual
human agent sitting there

605
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,940
or human trader sitting there.

606
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,620
They're gonna use all
these individual agents

607
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,790
to get some information

608
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,280
so we can finish the actual trade, right?

609
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,610
So with market analysis
agent, imagine I'm the trader,

610
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,817
I'm going to ask market analysis agent,

611
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,730
"Hey, find this specific share.

612
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,730
How is the social media
is talking about them?

613
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,750
Can I buy this or not?"

614
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,730
We get the whole sentiment from them.

615
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,867
But then we go and ask the
trading execution agent,

616
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:51,810
"Hey, I want to get this share
at this price, this volume."

617
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,330
That if this agent is
going to execute that,

618
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,460
and then I'm gonna go to
the risk management agent.

619
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,980
Imagine Eric, come and ask,
buy these, all these shares

620
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,620
and Eric wants to have
this specific risk score

621
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,453
that he want to manage.

622
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,680
If that's the case, I'll specify that one

623
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,990
and find the right mix
of the shares, right?

624
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,880
So the key here is each and
every agent is doing its own job

625
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,940
and writing the data,
using their own services

626
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,430
and writing in their own location.

627
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,450
It's fine for the timing

628
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,270
because I am the human
agent doing all this work.

629
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,913
They don't need to talk with each other.

630
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,130
Let's go to a little bit
more complex situation.

631
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,890
Now, we get a really good output.

632
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,110
People are happy, build more agents.

633
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,943
Guess what?

634
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,480
I'm gonna put some
portfolio management agent,

635
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,820
strategy agent, then risk management,

636
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,070
also communication agent.

637
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,510
Guess what?

638
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,640
The communication agent need
to talk with other agents

639
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,720
to get some information

640
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,793
so they can talk with the end customer.

641
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
This is where challenge comes.

642
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,550
If you have these individual
agents, write the date,

643
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,520
access their own services,
write in their own locations,

644
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,653
now, they cannot talk with each other.

645
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,880
This is what call agent
silos. Think about it.

646
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,093
That said, let's see what are
the challenges of agent silos?

647
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,520
Like I mentioned earlier, one
of the thing is integration.

648
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,550
Market analysis agent and strategy agents

649
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,440
need to talk with communication agent,

650
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,870
so it can be communicated
to the end customer.

651
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,790
That's where the integration comes in.

652
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,293
Another one is security.

653
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,560
When Akhil's team build its own agent,

654
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,510
they use some specific security services.

655
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,600
When Jey uses, he use some
specific services, right?

656
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,360
Now, how do you build a
comprehensive secretary passion

657
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,270
across all the agents so they
all can use the same services

658
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,620
and build a governance pattern.

659
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,780
That's one of the biggest challenge.

660
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,300
The next one is data inconsistency.

661
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,680
This is again, comes like, you know,

662
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,050
one agent writing into one location,

663
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,610
other one writing into another location.

664
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,550
Now, they both may have similar data

665
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,110
but different timeframes.

666
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,960
Now, that's where the data
inconsistency comes in.

667
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,760
Another one is scaling.

668
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,240
Again, like I mentioned
earlier, again, this scaling,

669
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,670
you can think of kinda
like inefficient scaling.

670
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,570
What's going to happen is you
ask this communication agent

671
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,390
to do some work and then
there's a risk management,

672
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,770
there's a market analysis agent.

673
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,030
They all are doing some work,

674
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,190
but they're not sharing
any data among them.

675
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,720
So they're gonna scale in their own,

676
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,730
they're gonna use all the
services, whatever they want.

677
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,950
They're not using anything
across each other.

678
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,900
So they're inefficiently scaling,
which is not good either.

679
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,550
So that said, let's see

680
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,370
how can we overcome all these challenges.

681
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,640
So again, this is a sample
of production application.

682
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,990
Again, in the end, you
can take a screenshot

683
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,700
of this application, how it looks like.

684
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,790
So if you think about
any agentic application,

685
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,360
we first start with it, top
level or application level,

686
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,940
application layer level, where
we are going to have a web

687
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,550
and mobile app where you
can access the agents.

688
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,740
Also, you might do some IDs like Kiro.

689
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,570
I love Kiro by the way.

690
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,840
So it'll help you to develop
the applications very fast

691
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,520
and then there might be
some chat interfaces.

692
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,140
It's getting more and
more popular nowadays.

693
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,280
If you want to talk with agents,

694
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,370
chat interfaces in a cool
way to access agents.

695
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,163
So what we should do first?
We need to authenticate.

696
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,380
So to authenticate with agents,

697
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,740
we can use Amazon Cognito, a great service

698
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,550
or you can use any of
the authentic services,

699
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,470
authentication services.

700
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,780
Once you authenticate with the agents.

701
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,660
The next thing is we have
agents and MCP services.

702
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,190
You might heard about MCP services,

703
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,030
but again, this kind of like
a services that use a protocol

704
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,160
that you can access outside tools

705
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,260
slash data sources with agents.

706
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,710
That's what MCP services are.

707
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,960
And then underneath that, LLM comes in,

708
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,370
large language model.

709
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,077
Again, you can use any
large language models

710
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,150
that come by Amazon, AWS.

711
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,500
I mean, talk to the associates architects,

712
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,780
they'll give you, they'll tell
you a list of all the LLMs

713
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,830
that you can use.

714
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,830
Again, to access those LLMs,
AWS, Amazon offers our Bedrock.

715
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,870
It's an API service, you can
access any of those LLMs.

716
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,380
Once you access those LLMS
and build your PoC or pilot,

717
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,750
what is next, move into production.

718
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,553
That's where AgentCore comes in.

719
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,950
If you want to deploy
your agents in scale,

720
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,750
you can use AgentCore.

721
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,190
Not only that, there are so many of that.

722
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,570
I'm going to talk, walk through them

723
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,943
while I'm opening up the slides.

724
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,720
So what is the next layer? Semantic layer.

725
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,553
What is this?

726
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,160
Imagine you have your LLM ready

727
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,070
and you wanted to use your own data.

728
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,960
You cannot just use your data as it is.

729
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,590
You may need to do some data
manipulation, some ETL job.

730
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,720
Plus, you need to create
some new connectivity

731
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,310
between those data.

732
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,470
So agents can use them as it is.

733
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,510
That's where the semantic layer comes in.

734
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,210
You can use services such as AWS Glue,

735
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,890
it'll do some ETL work for you

736
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,620
or Amazon Neptune database
to create some graph

737
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,150
or connectivity between the data.

738
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,630
That's where the semantic layer
comes in. So what is next?

739
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,450
Guess what? Data.

740
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,420
Again, under the hood,
everything driven by data.

741
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,670
You might think, oh, we need
a data lake immediately.

742
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,490
Guess what? No, you don't
need a data lake for this one.

743
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,440
Obviously, you can say, if
you have a data lake, amazing,

744
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,510
you can use it, even if you don't have it.

745
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,900
Still, if you know what
is your data, where it is

746
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,550
and how do you need to transform that

747
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,520
to use your agents, that's enough.

748
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,820
So have a comprehensive
list of all the data sources

749
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,400
and all these changes and
with that, you should be able

750
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,300
to build your agents and move forward.

751
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,090
So once you have all those things done,

752
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,500
your application's ready.

753
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,410
Now, you want to observe
across all the layers.

754
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,320
And again, AgentCore offers functionality.

755
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,620
You can observe not only
across different layers

756
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,330
but also inside your layer.

757
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,360
Imagine your market analysis agent

758
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,430
wants to talk with communication agent

759
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,350
and what's happening between those two.

760
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,810
You can observe using
the observative framework

761
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,373
that offered by AgentCore.

762
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,240
After all, security is
one of the top priority

763
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,830
for Amazon AWS.

764
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,663
So guess what we could do.

765
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,080
When your customers make a call,

766
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,960
imagine if Kalpana has made a call to buy,

767
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,360
say a hundred shares
from AWS, Amazon, right?

768
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,460
If that's the case,
what's going to happen?

769
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,680
Kalpana gets a dedicated session level

770
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,090
security for her session,

771
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,980
which means there won't be any data leak,

772
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,373
that any data leak that's
offered by AgentCore again.

773
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,290
So that said, we talk about
the production workload.

774
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,280
Now, we're going to talk about

775
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,000
some of the evaluation
techniques slash matrix.

776
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,320
Last year, if I ask you,

777
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,750
hey, how many evaluation metrics you have?

778
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,250
You might say five or six.

779
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,200
This year, we have 20.
Next year, who knows?

780
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,447
It might be 100.

781
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,710
The reason I'm telling you
is all these are not like,

782
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,020
there'll be a lot of metrics here.

783
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,453
But for your vertical it varies.

784
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,503
And also, you may have your
own custom metrics as well.

785
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:45,930
Especially for the finance,

786
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,180
I'm gonna talking about
three important metrics here.

787
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,190
One, accuracy.

788
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,740
When you make a transaction with a bot,

789
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,420
hey, I want to buy this many shares.

790
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,420
This price point, it should be
that. We cannot change that.

791
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,700
So that's where the accuracy comes in.

792
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,373
The second one is robustness.
What does that means?

793
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,600
When you train your model,
you use your training data,

794
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,100
models behave just fine.

795
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,930
But when you move to production,

796
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,300
we have some real world data there.

797
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,090
But still model needs
to be at the same way.

798
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,830
That's for the robustness.

799
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,613
The last one, this is one
of my favorite things, tone.

800
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,400
So what does tone means?

801
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,440
Like if you think about any bots

802
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
that you interact right away.

803
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,650
Like if you can think
of like it's a bot voice

804
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,060
and all those things, you will never get

805
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,860
trust from that voice.

806
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,940
But when you build a
financial advising agent,

807
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,160
it should have a voice,
not only just convincing,

808
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,960
but also data driven.

809
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,430
How do you build that?

810
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,410
That's the end of the metrics that we use.

811
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,400
So that said, I talked
about where to start,

812
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,307
also, how to build a business value,

813
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,060
what are the different
evaluation techniques,

814
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,100
production, workload, all those things.

815
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,080
But now, I'm going to hand out to Kalpana.

816
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,270
She's gonna talk about some
of the cool innovations.

817
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,730
She has new development lifecycle.

818
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,983
So that's it, Kalpana, floor is yours.

819
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,940
- Thank you, Jey. Hi, everybody.

820
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,490
How many of you have done something today

821
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,983
for Cyber Monday shopping on amazon.com?

822
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,520
Only one person. Oh, couple of people.

823
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,363
Okay, awesome.

824
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,690
So you know, we've been
talking about agents across

825
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,903
multiple industries, healthcare, retail,

826
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,080
and financial services.

827
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,110
Now, let's make it
super personal and real.

828
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,390
How many of you are aware of Rufus,

829
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,643
which is an agent that sits on amazon.com?

830
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,550
A few people, few people.

831
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,430
Okay, I use Rufus all the time

832
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,130
and it's super helpful for me as an agent.

833
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,910
And now, I have Rufus even
watching prices for items

834
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,280
that I really care about and alerting me

835
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,130
when it hits the right price
that I wanna buy it at.

836
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,230
So it's a very proactive agent for me

837
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,640
that watches amazon.com on
my behalf and does actions.

838
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,101
Now, how much do you think,
Jey talked about, you know,

839
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:05,700
if I had an agent that's a bot
that's helping my customers,

840
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,240
it could enhance a
customer experience by 15%.

841
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,840
How much more likely
do you think people are

842
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,480
to buy a product if
they engage with Rufus?

843
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,860
Just throw out some numbers.

844
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,350
What percentage do you
think people are more likely

845
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,110
to buy a product once
they've engaged with Rufus

846
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,360
versus not engaging with Rufus?

847
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,383
Throw some numbers.

848
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,230
80%. It's 60%, 60% more likely.

849
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,260
So if you've engaged with
Rufus, you're 60% more likely

850
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,360
to actually complete the transaction

851
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,090
versus if you haven't engaged with Rufus.

852
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,090
And it's projected to make
at $10 billion impact,

853
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,850
incremental impact on dot com for us.

854
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,070
So having Rufus as an agent

855
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,790
and people engaging with
Rufus is going to bring in

856
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,690
projected additional $10 billion with a B.

857
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,950
So that's how powerful
agents can be in real life

858
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,530
if they are doing all of the things that

859
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,440
my colleagues talked about,
they have the right voice,

860
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,870
they're secure, have the right tone,

861
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,420
are able to give you accurate answers,

862
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,610
are performant and scale.

863
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,670
I mean, it does us no
good if Rufus comes back

864
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,200
in five minutes and tells me something,

865
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,030
I moved on to something else, right?

866
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,340
It needs to be performance,
it needs to scale.

867
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,160
Hundreds of thousands
of requests every second

868
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,410
and Rufus needs to scale
across all of them,

869
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,480
but in a very secure way.

870
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,420
So we've talked about
multiple industry use cases.

871
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,890
What is top of mind for XX
across all of these industries?

872
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,010
It's not specific to a certain industry.

873
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,940
You know that executives
across all these industries

874
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,550
are very concerned about
speed of innovation.

875
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,620
That's one of the things
that's top of mind.

876
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,950
But how do I innovate at scale and speed

877
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,920
while keeping my ROI front and center?

878
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,410
Because it has to still
produce business value.

879
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,630
If I did Rufus just
because it's a cool toy,

880
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,340
that's not gonna go very far.

881
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,100
I need Rufus to actually
deliver business results,

882
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,290
like $10 billion of incremental revenue

883
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,270
for it to make sense for me to invest

884
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,400
and do all the performance and the scaling

885
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,410
and the security and
the governance, right?

886
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,740
But innovating at speed while
delivering business value

887
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,740
is top of mind across all
industries for executives.

888
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,920
At the same time, how do
I get my people educated?

889
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,930
And if agents are going
to be my teammates,

890
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,210
not just tools in my organization,

891
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,700
how do I integrate agents
into the organization?

892
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,130
What will that org
design look like, right?

893
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,760
That's again, top of mind for
executives at all industries.

894
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,630
Processes, Jey talked about responsible AI

895
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,700
and Akhil talked about the architectures

896
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,980
that you can develop for a very secure,

897
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,440
responsible agentic system.

898
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,340
And security and trust
as a technology platform

899
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,620
across all layers of
your agentic development.

900
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,870
Whatever your architecture
that you're building,

901
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,100
it's extremely important.

902
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,320
So these are some of the key areas

903
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,480
executives are very much concerned about

904
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,483
and bringing agents to production
in a very responsible way.

905
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,940
Across all of these concerns
and all of these use cases,

906
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,610
we talked about speed
of innovation, right?

907
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,290
So how do we transform
traditional development approaches

908
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,640
using agents to build agents, right?

909
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,140
So that's the key here.

910
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,840
How do I take advantage of Agentic AI

911
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,800
to put my net new agentic
innovations into production

912
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,480
regardless of any industry?

913
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,660
And how do I reimagine
that development lifecycle,

914
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,870
not just make incremental
progress, but how do I transform

915
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,580
and reimagine the whole thing?

916
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,660
And that is what we're
talking about in terms of

917
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,910
future of software development.

918
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,310
We're all very familiar
with traditional programming

919
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,010
with software development lifecycle, SDLC,

920
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,510
they're very familiar with that.

921
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,050
But in a very short three,
four-year time span,

922
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,740
traditional programming has
been dramatically disrupted

923
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,780
where we've gone from code completion

924
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,880
to chat-based programming.

925
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,740
Everybody's doing vibe coding now,

926
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,130
but in the future, we
anticipate AI clusters

927
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,460
and AI fleets to be helping
our development teams.

928
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,560
Now, what you see on the right hand side

929
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,490
is a very hierarchical
imagination of agents coming into

930
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,030
and becoming teammates on your Dev teams.

931
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:32,030
But really, what will happen
in reality is more a swarm,

932
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,060
a very decentralized
agentic groups of things

933
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,760
that are happening along
with human collaboration

934
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,080
to bring something to forth.

935
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,820
That's really what we envision.

936
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,890
But the reason it's shown is hierarchical

937
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,420
is to get conversation going.

938
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,820
When people see org
design, which agents in it,

939
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,290
it gets a conversation started.

940
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,287
And executives are like,

941
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,220
"How do I think about
agents in my organization?

942
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,650
What do I do about KPIs for those agents?

943
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,840
Do I measure them just like humans do?

944
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,580
And what do I do with comparison?

945
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,910
And how do I account for ROI?
What's my cost going to be?

946
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,550
What should the value that
I should derive from them?"

947
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,160
They all have calculations
for teammates, right?

948
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,440
How do I do the same things for agents?

949
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,480
It's a great conversation starter,

950
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,893
but it gets people thinking.

951
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,900
So AI-DLC is the same thing as SDLC,

952
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,490
but doing it with AI
in every way possible.

953
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,710
How do I get agents and AI

954
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,320
injected into my development lifecycle?

955
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,790
To build my net new innovation
is what AI-DLC is all about.

956
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,810
It's a methodology, not
necessarily a product or a service.

957
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,810
So regardless of what service, what tool,

958
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,400
what product you're using,

959
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,300
you can always adopt
this AI-DLC methodology

960
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,460
to help speed up your innovation.

961
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,190
Again, goes to speed of innovation

962
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,050
and doing it the right cost

963
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,020
and bringing agents into
your development lifecycle

964
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,460
for your net new product.

965
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,100
It could be a net new software
product you're building.

966
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,830
It could be a workflow that
you're trying to automate

967
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,990
that helps with employee productivity

968
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,160
within your organization.

969
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,960
It could be a customer service agent

970
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,130
that you're putting in place.

971
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,960
It doesn't matter what
you're trying to do,

972
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,510
but if you bring in a AI methodology,

973
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,090
AI development lifecycle
methodology to it,

974
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,630
you are going to automatically
speed up your innovation.

975
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,610
And that's the fundamental thing

976
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,130
that we're trying to do with AI-DLC.

977
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,200
And there are three phases to AI-DLC.

978
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,790
The first phase is inception.

979
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,940
This is where you are
kind of thinking through

980
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,140
what the product is going to be.

981
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,880
How am I going to develop the product?

982
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,000
That's the fundamental thing in inception.

983
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,040
And then construction is
when we are going to get

984
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,180
into active construction.

985
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,230
This is where you're building
your net new innovation.

986
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,230
And then operations is you
have to deploy it at scale

987
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,450
and get it productive, right?

988
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,760
So let's look at how this works

989
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,740
and what the roles and rituals are.

990
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,410
How many of you are familiar
with agile development

991
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,870
in your firms?

992
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,630
Majority of you, majority
of you're very familiar

993
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,463
with agile development.

994
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:03,840
So you understand what
roles and rituals are.

995
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,180
So how do we take those roles and rituals

996
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,250
that you're very familiar with SDLC

997
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,990
and how do we change it
and alter it for AI-DLC

998
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,370
is what we're gonna look at.

999
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,980
So remember we talked
about the inception phase.

1000
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,700
This is where you have this large intent

1001
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,170
that you're going to go after.

1002
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,410
Maybe you're building a net
new product, a net new project,

1003
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,760
whatever you're trying to do.

1004
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,260
So what is the intent of that?

1005
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,840
And then you wanna
break it down, you know,

1006
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,760
in the old style would
call it epics, right?

1007
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,310
Here, we're going break
it down into units.

1008
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,043
And how do we do that? That's
the key thing with AI-DLC.

1009
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:38,940
It's not just,

1010
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,040
oh, I just changed the
word from epic to unit.

1011
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,150
That's not what it is.

1012
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:47,150
It really is how do I use
AI in my inception phase?

1013
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,180
So I am not the one writing the units.

1014
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,510
I have the large intent and
I am going to get agents

1015
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,900
and AI to write the units for me.

1016
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,060
What is a task to be performed?

1017
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,920
What are the features that I need?

1018
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,000
And you do, you prompt the
agent to give you those answers.

1019
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,300
So AI is actually doing
your units for you.

1020
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,030
It is not a human doing it. So
what's the role of the human?

1021
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,020
What's the product owner?

1022
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,770
What's the development team
doing with AI in inception?

1023
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,050
They are guiding it, they're reviewing it.

1024
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,033
So that's how you get the speed.

1025
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,920
The next phase is actual
construction and development.

1026
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,820
Here you're doing mob
programming and mob testing.

1027
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,100
Again, the development team

1028
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,990
is not actually writing the code.

1029
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,650
They're prompting AI to write the code.

1030
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,970
And that's the key here.

1031
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,930
So your job is to prompt review, redirect,

1032
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,460
prompt, review, redirect.

1033
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,350
And so, you go in that loop.

1034
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,650
And you will see that we're
not doing sprints anymore,

1035
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,420
we're doing bolts.

1036
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,350
Why?

1037
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,760
It is really specifically
conveying speed of development.

1038
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,980
Sprint as fast as you can sprint.

1039
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,440
If you're Usain Bolt, you're
really bolting, right?

1040
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,940
You're not sprinting.

1041
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,180
So that wasn't meant for Usain Bolt,

1042
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,130
but I'm just making something,

1043
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,320
some correlation for it to stick.

1044
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,070
So you really are at
lightning speed moving forward

1045
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,970
with your development and your testing

1046
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,090
and it's an iterated loop.

1047
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,030
You could see how each
bolt goes into a loop

1048
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,010
where you've got the code, you prompted,

1049
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,710
it's given you a code,
agent is going to get you

1050
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,760
the test units as well.

1051
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,390
AI is writing the test cases,
it's testing, confirming,

1052
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,670
and then we're going in
that loop again, right?

1053
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,040
So you get through development

1054
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,530
and then you're going to go do deployment

1055
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,880
where product owners, developers,

1056
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,560
and AI are again, involved.

1057
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,340
But again, for deployment,
infrastructure as code,

1058
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,870
AI, agents helping you deploy
what you've produced as well,

1059
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,860
what you've developed.

1060
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,860
So that is what AI-DLC is
where the primary focus is

1061
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,330
not humans doing the tasks,

1062
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,000
but how are they gonna
get AI to do the tasks

1063
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,900
and how are they prompting,
reviewing, redirecting,

1064
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,950
and going in that loop.

1065
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,180
That's the key.

1066
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,980
And what can you really achieve
by using AI-DLC versus SDLC?

1067
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,873
That's a good question, right?

1068
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,843
Here's a customer, Dhan,

1069
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,360
who took their existing Jira backlog,

1070
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,610
whatever that they have in Jira

1071
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,360
and used AI-DLC against
their Jira backlog.

1072
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,450
So this is not for a cutesy net new,

1073
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,970
brand new development only project.

1074
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,820
AI-DLC is not only for,
oh, what's a net new idea?

1075
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,320
I have no tech debt.

1076
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
I am starting from a blank sheet of paper

1077
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,370
and then I will deploy AI-DLC.

1078
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,890
It's great, it'll work for that as well.

1079
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,350
But we know the reality
in most enterprises,

1080
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,570
we already have running projects right now

1081
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:52,980
that we want to speed up, our
net new projects we wanna add,

1082
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,620
features we wanna add
to existing products.

1083
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,090
That's the reality of life.

1084
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,670
So the question is, can
I use AI-DLC for those?

1085
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,950
Absolutely, you can use AI-DLC for it.

1086
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,250
It's a methodology that we
come and teach your Dev teams

1087
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,980
on how to do, where we walk,

1088
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,750
walk the product owners, the dev teams,

1089
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,510
and the test teams on how to use AI-DLC,

1090
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,240
adapt it as a methodology
using your existing tools,

1091
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,080
existing services, existing
backlog that you have.

1092
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,450
Just using this methodology,
how can you speed up?

1093
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,110
And with Dhan, we were able
to take what was two months

1094
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,710
of development using their
existing agile methodology

1095
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,120
that they had put in place.

1096
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,940
And we shared with AI-DLC
how they can deliver it

1097
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,770
in two days instead.

1098
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,220
So that's the kind of
revolutionary re-imagining

1099
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,170
transformation we're talking about.

1100
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,900
It's not incremental, it's
not going from, you know,

1101
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,540
two months to maybe I
could cut a week off.

1102
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,110
It truly is taking two months
of your existing backlog

1103
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,120
and how do I deliver it in two days.

1104
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,900
And that's what this
methodology teaches you.

1105
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,823
So in closing, right?

1106
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,750
We have seen multiple industry use cases

1107
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,290
across healthcare, retail, finance.

1108
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,470
We have seen what are the
key architecture patterns

1109
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,200
that you wanna adopt
depending on what you want

1110
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,320
that agent to do and how you
use an orchestration layer

1111
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,600
to bring all these agents together,

1112
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,790
where you're using multiple
architecture patterns

1113
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,990
for the individual agents,

1114
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:22,290
but then working as a team,
how do you bring that together?

1115
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,860
We talked about how to go
from pilot to production

1116
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,560
and what are the key things
you have to keep in mind.

1117
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,740
And then what is a methodology you can use

1118
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,770
to speed everything up, get
to your innovation faster

1119
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,020
and get to your ROI faster.

1120
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,870
Hope that was very helpful.
We have a few minutes left.

1121
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,020
We can take some
questions if you have any.
