1
00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:01,360
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:03,778
I'm Austin, I'm here from Metronome,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,589
and we're here to tell you why use space building must

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,980
be treated as infrastructure.

5
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:12,890
So this is actually our first, uh,

6
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,179
AWS reinvent that I've been to and

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,329
can be more proud to be here.

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,609
Um, we have folks from across the industry,

9
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,510
um,

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:20,728
companies like,

11
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,420
uh, Salesforce that invented SAS to modern,

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,629
uh, startups like OpenAI and Anthropic,

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,708
defining the future of what computing is,

14
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,530
so. I'm

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,658
Austin. I'm a solutions engineer here at

16
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,939
Metronome, so I've helped, uh.

17
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:38,228
Develop and land and expand

18
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:40,418
some of our uh largest clients

19
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,639
as well as our startup program

20
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:44,929
uh which I'll tell you more about towards the end of this

21
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:45,579
presentation.

22
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:48,118
So

23
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:50,728
Metronome does support some of the largest names

24
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:53,048
in AI as well as usage-based

25
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:54,228
uh software

26
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,798
today. So those are names that you might have

27
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:59,168
heard of like OpenAI and Confluent,

28
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:01,609
uh, as well as Anthropic, Nvidia, Lang Chain.

29
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:04,189
It's been pretty fun walking around the expo floor

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,698
this week and seeing a lot of the logos,

31
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,219
uh, that we've helped support,

32
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,370
grow, and grown with over the past several years.

33
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:15,159
So why must

34
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:18,120
Usage based billing, modernization

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,549
be infrastructure in this modern age.

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,198
I think we're all familiar with the previous eras of

37
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,409
software you sell a license, you

38
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,269
kind of forget,

39
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,769
and they use as much or as little

40
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,049
of that service as you provide.

41
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,088
Then we move this access,

42
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,549
uh, subscription consumption seats, a

43
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,668
little bit more of this value match, but as

44
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:40,838
you can see, let's try out the laser clicker

45
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:41,370
that's fun.

46
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,629
Uh, we are here at the nexus of

47
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,558
this new era, this

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,948
agentic outcome, workflows,

49
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:50,028
actions, hybrid, you name

50
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:52,079
it, we are seeing new pricing

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,290
models be invented

52
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:54,290
nearly.

53
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,299
I wouldn't say every day, but it's it's pretty common,

54
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,359
and they're all coming into Metronome and discussing

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,939
with us about how

56
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:03,510
to meet the value of their product

57
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,799
with their end customers, and it's also

58
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,418
safe to say

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,879
that Metronome is here and has been

60
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,949
here to support these pricing models,

61
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,240
things that we like to call hybrid, which

62
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,639
are really exciting. So as companies

63
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,069
transition from pure seats

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,118
to seats with allocations, trying

65
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:22,159
to understand and meet that value with their end

66
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,860
customers while also understanding.

67
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,409
That the underlying cost structure of their

68
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,028
service is changing.

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,469
LLMs are obviously,

70
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,849
uh, pure usage, and so when you

71
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,929
actually use them, you're burning down on

72
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,069
something you're incurring costs. It's very difficult

73
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,879
to match that towards a see of subscription,

74
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,389
so we're moving in this new age where,

75
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,889
as I'm sure you're seeing from the entire expo floor,

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,808
everybody's talking about agentic pricing.

77
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,250
It's very difficult to just slap on that

78
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,308
to a subscription and say that you're done.

79
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,899
Monetization is now real time. So

80
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,020
in the past billing used to be this

81
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,679
kind of

82
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,319
slow humdrum service.

83
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,770
You'd batch processes, you give your customers

84
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,939
a monthly invoice. They're all backward

85
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,159
looking. You have to

86
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,580
update things in spreadsheets. It's all kind of

87
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,618
relegated to the back office. Finance

88
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:10,520
doesn't really

89
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,139
care or talk to anybody else. It's really about

90
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,659
collecting bills at the end of the month and those subscriptions

91
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,960
are really what they are.

92
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,649
They're really detached from the product experience and

93
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,710
detached from that value that we're talking about.

94
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,979
Monetization now is real time

95
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,308
things like, uh, your

96
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:28,490
in moment workflows and notification systems,

97
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,729
gating entitlement, as well as making it

98
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,199
core to the product experience.

99
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,588
Everybody here on this expo floor

100
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,899
can certainly tell you that. If you go and

101
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,969
use chat DBT, you're interacting with a thing

102
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,979
called tokens. Now, can everybody describe what a

103
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,058
token is? I'm not sure. Some days

104
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:43,649
I don't know,

105
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,270
but it is core towards the usage of these

106
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,300
products. It is a strategic growth lever

107
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,479
as you're connecting

108
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,939
the the experience with your customers

109
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,058
to the end state of actually using the

110
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:57,360
product. So

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,368
monetization is the infrastructure, right?

112
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,740
It is the continuous flywheel of

113
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,919
developing your product and

114
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:05,288
continuing to iterate and match with your

115
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,149
customers. So

116
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Metronome, uh, in particular

117
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,538
does this through what we call our events. These

118
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,879
are business events, any sort of transaction

119
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:16,350
that might incur costs that might incur usage,

120
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,730
that might change the utilization

121
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,220
of your product. These are things like an API

122
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,579
call. I keep talking about LLMs.

123
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,019
Inferences being made, servers spun up, spun

124
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,139
down, continuous heartbeats while

125
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,540
a service lives live. These are all

126
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,439
things that have

127
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,889
we're very familiar with and have been around for years, but

128
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:36,059
actually attributed to them in real time and

129
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,959
doing things like gating off access,

130
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,699
letting customers know they're going into overages,

131
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,858
or even just from a go to market perspective, letting

132
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,028
them know, hey, you've hit. 90% of your

133
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:47,350
pre-commit, you might want to engage in an upsell.

134
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,709
These are things that we think are critical and they can't just be

135
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:52,069
done on even a daily basis

136
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,350
or even worse, a monthly basis. These have to be real

137
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,629
time. These are engagements that are pretty critical

138
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,660
that we're all are starting to become very deeply

139
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,689
familiar with whenever you, uh,

140
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,829
hit a little bit too much send on cloud code

141
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:04,608
and it runs for a little bit too far.

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,209
That's the kind of real-time product

143
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,670
experience that you need and that's why

144
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,000
this is an infrastructure problem. This isn't just

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,750
something that happens on the back office anymore.

146
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,420
In invoices and revenue data

147
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,889
have to be understood in real time, and

148
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,829
this is also where Metronome starts to sit.

149
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:22,250
The usage aggregation, the invoice computation

150
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,480
happens on every single event.

151
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,850
It is generating a new invoice. It's how

152
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,629
we think about these sorts of problems.

153
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:30,949
So why is this hard?

154
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,439
Why is Metronome even around? User space billing

155
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,439
is not some novel concept. We

156
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,480
didn't invent it. We just seem to be getting it

157
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
right. That's because in the

158
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,540
past transactional observability

159
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:44,160
was a pick two problem. You had correctness,

160
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,199
low latency, and high availability, and everybody

161
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,269
just kind of chose to, and we're like it's

162
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:48,939
good enough.

163
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,040
But again this is extremely difficult. Correctness

164
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,259
on its own for financial services, you would, you

165
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,699
need to make sure that every single cent is attributed

166
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,738
and matched. You need to make sure that you're ready

167
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,119
for your audits as you go

168
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,519
continuing to be, let's say, a public company

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,678
and confluent or you're a startup and making sure

170
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:06,269
that, uh,

171
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,619
you actually pass an audit so you can raise that next

172
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,338
round of funding.

173
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:11,720
Events also may arrive out of order. These

174
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,108
things need to be burned down on the actual attribution

175
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,319
of that time stamp that you're sending in the metronome.

176
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,920
This can't just be a a hey, we'll receive it eventually

177
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
and it gets attributed.

178
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,399
Correctness is key towards a, a

179
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,298
billing platform.

180
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,470
Low latency. This is again what we keep talking

181
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,588
about that real-time service alerts

182
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,350
for entitlement gating and fraud detection.

183
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,949
We're moving towards these usage

184
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,338
platforms that are customers,

185
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,428
uh, PLG oriented

186
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:40,428
so customers have immediate access, but as a

187
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:41,238
business. Provider,

188
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,699
you don't necessarily trust somebody who might just be signing

189
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,079
up for your service. Now you might give them a free trial credit,

190
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,660
but the difference between that and actually

191
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,798
making sure that you're not running and incurring bad

192
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:52,910
debt while also growing your business is essential.

193
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,959
Your customers are also starting to expect real-time

194
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,189
information. There are plenty of uh

195
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,509
platforms that we're all very familiar with that

196
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,670
maybe give you a 24 hour update after

197
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,709
usage that can't be the same thing for

198
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,829
a PLG style consumer

199
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,028
oriented product. You need to understand in real

200
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,269
time your burndown is and also if you're talking

201
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,730
about a finance team, they need to understand

202
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,230
across all sorts of customer, all sorts of

203
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,350
users where they're actually at month

204
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,949
to month.

205
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,269
And then that high availability, this is

206
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:24,350
because it's infrastructure because it lives at the core

207
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,269
of this product,

208
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:28,009
you need to have extremely high availability.

209
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,149
Billing can never go down. Your product

210
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:31,410
might be able to go down,

211
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,709
but billing has to be

212
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,790
available, has to be ready to be up

213
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,028
at every single moment. Those dashboards

214
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,028
that power all sorts of these things have to

215
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,028
be extremely available so you can understand

216
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,048
where your clients are at.

217
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,649
Again, why is metronome

218
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,579
what we are?

219
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,759
Because we got all three.

220
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,250
The infrastructure principles applied to monetization

221
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,139
are these 4.

222
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,649
It has to be scalable. It has to be modular. It has

223
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,649
to be, you have to be able to orchestrate things and it has

224
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,309
to be extensible as your company

225
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:03,069
and your customer base grows and as you iterate.

226
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,329
Nobody actually gets pricing right on the first go,

227
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,053
so that means that every single. One of these pieces

228
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:10,254
of this puzzle have to be extensible, have

229
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:12,454
to be scalable. You have to be able to change

230
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,653
things. You have to be able to think ahead as well as

231
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:16,653
potentially backdate things and extend

232
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:17,314
the platform

233
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,894
as your company grows and you start to build more

234
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,814
pieces of your billing stack.

235
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,389
Scalability for one, real-time

236
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,809
information on ingest that's invoice computation

237
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,500
as I talked about during usage.

238
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,709
Surges can happen,

239
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,428
but you need to be able to like ingest

240
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:34,859
in real time,

241
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,308
not fall over.

242
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,889
OpenAI, as I'm sure you can imagine, scaling

243
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,070
up and scaling down

244
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,879
all in um a very flexible

245
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,408
fashion.

246
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,779
Modularity, this is really where Metronome

247
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,759
got things right over the past couple of years,

248
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:52,129
decoupling every single piece of

249
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,129
your, your billing model so you

250
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,590
can do things like

251
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,129
having extremely nuanced customer

252
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,408
contracts for your largest customers who are really

253
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,590
good negotiators and then the opposite. Side

254
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,109
of things when you have a PLG segment

255
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,269
that is completely separate but also

256
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,389
the same products at their core, being able

257
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,750
to roll out those pricing changes while

258
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,190
not being able to do things like migrations

259
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,428
we like to say that migrations are a dirty word at at

260
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,509
Metronome. We don't do them, everything is

261
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:19,489
updated in real time.

262
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:23,440
And that orchestration that is things like

263
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,840
having those invoices be sent off to

264
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,979
your actual payment provider, having

265
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:30,058
those dashboards, uh, inform

266
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,070
your customers, those spend alerts

267
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,359
you can have things like a

268
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:36,700
90% threshold warning, let customers

269
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,779
go into arrears, but still gate them off when they

270
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,219
hit 150%. These are becoming core

271
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:43,298
product experiences that are essential

272
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,460
and, uh, deeply entrenched in your billing.

273
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,889
As well as those credit ledgers, you need to

274
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,038
understand at the end of the day for revenue recognition

275
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,989
purposes for burn down purposes

276
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,609
where things are actually going.

277
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:56,570
And that extensibility

278
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,149
Metronome sits at the heart of your entire modernization.

279
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:02,690
So again we talked about those usage events, those

280
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,000
transactions that are coming in, they're feeding

281
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,168
into this platform that has that real-time

282
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:09,168
meeting and rating pricing and packaging, which

283
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,590
is extensible and flexible,

284
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,908
as well as the contract life cycle management,

285
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,029
knowing what. When your customers are gonna

286
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,129
be ending their contract,

287
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,009
when to

288
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,090
engage with them again on a sales motion,

289
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,509
when to move them to a free trial, when to

290
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,788
move them to an arrears contract, and

291
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:26,149
then from there is what you get on the bottom

292
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,308
and the right hand side of this graph.

293
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,009
So it is things like,

294
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,428
let's make sure I don't hit the wrong button, your

295
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,509
CRM as well as your billing portal and all

296
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,690
the data lakes so that your team

297
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,908
can understand extremely deeply where

298
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:42,009
your finances are at, where your customers are at.

299
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:43,558
Evaluate,

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,119
understand, analyze, and iterate on your pricing

301
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,940
and packaging, as well as

302
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,719
this right-hand side where all the money actually

303
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,678
goes. That's what we

304
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:54,359
at the end of the day actually care about is that while we're

305
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,359
actually doing a consumption-based business, we need to

306
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,399
make sure that we're collecting the invoices for

307
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,469
our customers. It isn't just for the love of the

308
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,639
game. It is actually we need to make sure that our business

309
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,178
is healthy

310
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,379
and that those invoices be sent somewhere.

311
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
And of course AWS Marketplaces,

312
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,899
Metronome also sits and provides for them,

313
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,840
as well as a little company called Stripe.

314
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,808
So you have to be prepared for this velocity of AI.

315
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,058
AI is not just the buzzword

316
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:21,109
anymore, it's the businesses that we all operate in.

317
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,629
Companies like uh are are

318
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:27,168
testing their pricing model. They're making iterations,

319
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,649
uh, they, you know, OpenAI in particular

320
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,928
made 10+ pricing changes in the past

321
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:32,859
12 months.

322
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,190
You know, somebody might wake up and decide that they

323
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,308
want to compete on a different model and they drop the price.

324
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,389
They do that through Metronome as

325
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,933
well as 85% of. Software companies are adopting

326
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:42,994
usage based pricing.

327
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,575
It might not be core and essential towards their pricing

328
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:46,875
model, but it might be some

329
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:49,173
hybrid aspect as they are rolling

330
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,195
out things like

331
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,594
an agent on top of their platform

332
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,734
or integrating LLMs into the product

333
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,394
experience. These are becoming

334
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,715
essential towards the new era of software.

335
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,979
So modernization engineers, this is a new title

336
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,538
that we're seeing actually on uh

337
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:06,469
hiring pages,

338
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,859
why they should demand all these aspects

339
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,070
out of their platform.

340
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,580
Can your service process millions of events

341
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,700
in real time? Can you handle that PLG

342
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,599
scale that is, uh,

343
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:17,599
the new

344
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,538
way to grow your business isn't just a like

345
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,570
marketing scheme. It is actually how you. Mature

346
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,609
customers, early adopters into

347
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,889
enterprise customers, kind of stay up with

348
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,200
everything, right? What we talked about that that billing

349
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,509
needs to be essential and needs to always be available.

350
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,849
Can you deploy those pricing changes without real

351
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:34,399
deploys,

352
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,168
without migrations? Can you do a few clicks

353
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:38,889
from somebody who is not an engineer?

354
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,109
Can you set this pipeline up to be

355
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:43,719
completely removed and let RevOps then do. Things

356
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,918
like pricing changes, pricing experiments

357
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:46,580
in your platform,

358
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,000
and can finance and product share one source

359
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,158
of truth. This isn't just an engineering

360
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,469
problem. This is a finance problem. This is a bizopps

361
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:55,519
problem, but it is something that can be solved

362
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,719
by engineers evaluating the proper

363
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:00,058
tool that will take you from today

364
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,739
through the end state of

365
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:04,250
potentially this entire, uh, AI

366
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,479
era. And

367
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,479
again, Metronome powers this modernization

368
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,879
infrastructure, so we sit at this

369
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,219
at the center of this with real-time invoice compute

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
and uh a modular pricing

371
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,899
model so we can

372
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,639
create, iterate, roll through pricing

373
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,599
changes and

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,320
issue out those usage statements and invoicing

375
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,899
data.

376
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:28,158
Obviously OpenAI is pretty essential

377
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,168
towards our business and we have a pretty good case study

378
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,369
for them. It's on our website if you want to read more,

379
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,450
but Metronome is at the heart of

380
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,529
how, uh, OpenAI joined. We actually

381
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,928
like to say that when OpenAI joined us, we got the name

382
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,969
wrong. There were some random little research lab we called

383
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:42,048
them OpenAPI.

384
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,090
They're now a little bit more, uh, relevant towards

385
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,090
our, our day to day lives. They're adding new

386
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,369
LLMs every day.

387
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:50,719
They are deploying to millions of users in

388
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,729
real time. They're making pricing

389
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:53,710
updates that are not,

390
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,048
you know, months.

391
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:56,690
Discussions,

392
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,330
committees, these are done with finance

393
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,450
and they're matching the value while understanding

394
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,460
the analytics that are coming out of Metronome and

395
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,469
they have ultra efficient billing operations.

396
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,750
So, a little exciting thing that we're doing here

397
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,009
at Reinvent. If you want to come by our booth

398
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,590
and sign up to claim $1 million in

399
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,928
customer billing credits,

400
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:18,548
you may have to go through another demo, you may not,

401
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,109
but we will get you set up and live and

402
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,109
uh you can start using Metronome today,

403
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,548
playing around, kicking in the tires and get

404
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,750
again a million dollars worth of customer

405
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,590
billing credits with Metronome.

406
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,869
Our booth is right over there, somewhere near

407
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:32,940
Silla Cribble-ish.

408
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,629
There's a number on there, but nobody's actually looking those up.

409
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,029
Thank you. Again, come see us at our booth.
