1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,169
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:04,448
Well, thank you. I really appreciate that. I, I've

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,570
got to actually start this talk with a, with a really short

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,648
story, a kind of a funny story, maybe get a kick out

5
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:10,849
of it. It just before I came out, they

6
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,050
said, well, hey, can you stand over to the side because we're gonna

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,050
introduce you, then we want you to walk out. And

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,208
I said, oh, I get to make like a big sort of a rock

9
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,929
star entry, right? Like I can come out.

10
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:21,010
And she said, yeah, we're gonna play

11
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,670
like Metallica, Enter Sandman as you're like

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,708
entering the stage. And I said, oh, that means I'm gonna put

13
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,269
him to sleep, right? You know, so,

14
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,670
like, anyway, I just thought that was really funny, I thought that

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,978
I would share that with you. So,

16
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,618
anyway, welcome to today's talk,

17
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:35,029
Driving resilience with assurance and visibility

18
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,109
from edge to cloud. And, uh, let me

19
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,228
just start by asking you guys a couple of questions

20
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:41,228
by a show of hands. So, how many of you

21
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:43,889
work, uh, in a more application-focused

22
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:46,380
setting like DevOps, SREs,

23
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:47,529
that type of thing?

24
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:50,319
Nobody? OK, that's a good start.

25
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:52,719
How many of you are more focused on the network side?

26
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:55,109
How many of you work, uh, work in network

27
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,759
operations or manage infrastructure,

28
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,240
uh, those types of things.

29
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,740
OK, so that's, so that's great. So, what

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,719
we're, what we're gonna actually talk about here today,

31
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:05,338
um, is, is assurance. Um,

32
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,079
and let me just kind of get started here,

33
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,500
um, by talking about some of the challenges

34
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,888
that we have in today's world. And And

35
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:14,049
today's world is, is way different than the

36
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,269
way things used to be. So there's a new normal

37
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:18,409
in place. And what we've seen really is,

38
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,528
is really three different departures. So there's been

39
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:21,549
a departure

40
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,808
from reactive troubleshooting

41
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:26,219
to an approach that's really centered

42
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:28,870
on AI ops and proactive,

43
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,168
um, incident detection and then proactive

44
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:33,209
remediation. And so that's

45
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,290
the, that's the mode or that's the posture that

46
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,528
we really need to be in today.

47
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,049
The second thing is basically

48
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,099
unified end to end visibility. So,

49
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,250
it used to be that, you know,

50
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,040
within your operational silos, this is why I asked the

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,159
question, uh, from a network standpoint, you were

52
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,689
used to using network tooling, like network management

53
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:51,808
or NPM types of tools.

54
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,370
If you worked in application design or

55
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,290
application architecture,

56
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,388
you used

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,859
application. Performance monitoring or full stack

58
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,379
observability, that type of thing. And

59
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,519
what, what the new normal really demands now

60
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,198
in your environments is something that's a lot more unified

61
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:08,699
and a lot more seamless for your end users.

62
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,099
And then finally, we're really talking about

63
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,080
a departure

64
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,580
from traditional operational

65
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,649
models to one that's much more

66
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:18,830
collaborative. And one that's really designed

67
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,879
to implement simplified and streamlined

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,038
workflows into your

69
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:25,770
operations so that you can achieve better collaboration,

70
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,110
so that you can reduce the amount of finger pointing that

71
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,110
you deal with on a day to day basis, and that

72
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,349
you can basically address your end users'

73
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,469
concerns and assure their experiences

74
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,469
in a much more proactive and

75
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,169
effective way.

76
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,258
And really what's driving a lot of this, um,

77
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:42,278
is the increased complexity that we

78
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,538
say, that we see across

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,028
the digital landscape in today's world.

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,389
And it really starts with your end users.

81
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,679
Your end users are now, they used to be that they were all

82
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,719
located in offices. Well, now they're working at

83
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,758
home, or, and they're working in

84
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,409
offices that can be, that can be in campus

85
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,479
locations. They can be located in coffee

86
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,479
shops, and maybe they're not even human. Maybe

87
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,038
they're IOT events. But,

88
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,639
but nonetheless,

89
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,284
these users are trying to gain. Access

90
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:09,564
to those applications, and those applications

91
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,765
are now no longer hosted in

92
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:14,085
enterprise or premises specific environments.

93
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,686
They're hosted in, in, in hybrid cloud environments.

94
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,045
They're hosted in in AWS EC2

95
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:20,344
instances. They leverage

96
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:23,325
services like global load balancers or CDNs.

97
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,545
They leverage cloud-based services like DNS,

98
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:28,246
but they still can be located in enterprise

99
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,385
data centers, or they can be SAS

100
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:32,645
applications, and SAS applications pose a significant

101
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,186
challenge

102
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:35,564
because you as an applications person or

103
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:38,031
some Supporting your end user community,

104
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,491
you don't have any visibility or control into SAS

105
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:41,042
environments.

106
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:44,091
But the real challenge lies in this midsection

107
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,551
here, which is the digital supply chain,

108
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,961
and that consists of your own private networks.

109
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,360
It consists of internet transit. It

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,572
consists of cloud provider networks and all the

111
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,051
adjacent services,

112
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,450
as well as all the underlying technologies

113
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,352
and dependencies

114
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,852
that make that work, like BGP, like the

115
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:03,170
internet routing system, like DNS and

116
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,217
things like that. So you Really need

117
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,358
to have complete end to end visibility

118
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:09,556
in order to attain the

119
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:11,697
proactive operational stance that

120
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:14,138
you really want to achieve here. So

121
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,377
now, the reality is that

122
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:18,617
most teams and most IT organizations

123
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:21,367
today operate in somewhat of a siloed

124
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,577
model, meaning that some of you

125
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:25,858
are responsible for applications, whether

126
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,898
you're DevOps, whether you're application

127
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:29,757
architects, whether you're developers,

128
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,517
whether you're SREs,

129
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,523
some, some, some of You are responsible

130
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,603
for managing or maintaining infrastructure,

131
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:39,062
and that can be your on-premise locations

132
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,144
or it can be your cloud environments. It could be that

133
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:43,182
you're an architect focused specifically

134
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,843
on Kubernetes, specifically on distributed

135
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,113
container-based applications, and so on,

136
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,384
that also has connectivity, or you

137
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:52,384
can be working in a network silo. And,

138
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,944
and in the network world, basically, you're really

139
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,182
concerned purely with the connectivity and the

140
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:58,603
performance and the availability

141
00:04:58,944 --> 00:04:59,884
of your networks

142
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:02,103
across this entire digital supply chain.

143
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,298
But the problem is, is what do you do for those environments

144
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,449
that are outside of your control? Because again,

145
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,980
you don't control SAS applications, you

146
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,048
don't control ISP networks,

147
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,298
you, you, you have very little control even

148
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,379
over, over your cloud environments, and

149
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,040
you really,

150
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:21,079
uh, you don't have control, but you are still responsible

151
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:23,738
for delivering high-quality user

152
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,769
experiences to your end users.

153
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,005
And so you really don't have Control over

154
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,245
that. So,

155
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,925
the, and the problem now is that, is

156
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,185
that slow response time

157
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,605
and degraded performance leads to degraded

158
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:37,276
experiences.

159
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,716
When your users have a degraded experience,

160
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:42,045
they think that that's the same as an outage from

161
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,165
their perspective. Why?

162
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,846
Because it's stopping them from being productive. It's

163
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,125
preventing them from reaching your website. It's

164
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,485
preventing them from executing transactions.

165
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:53,151
or payments on your websites, you

166
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,610
know, and so if there's an, if there's a slowdown

167
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,190
or a bottleneck or some kind of degradation

168
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,821
across that digital delivery chain,

169
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,380
they see that as the same as an outage.

170
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,980
Whether it's a network issue, whether it's an

171
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,690
application issue, they don't really care.

172
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,271
But guess what? You do, OK. You

173
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:10,331
have to solve that issue

174
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:11,812
somehow, some way,

175
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,891
wherever it happens to reside.

176
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,470
And so what I'm going to talk about are a couple of different

177
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,009
solutions from Cisco,

178
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:21,488
one being Splunk observability,

179
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,869
and then the other being Cisco 1000 Eyes,

180
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,389
which is essentially assurance for digital

181
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,178
experiences.

182
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,509
And so what Cisco's actually done, and

183
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,629
we talked about some of the problems inherent in this

184
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:32,139
earlier,

185
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,509
which is that we've, we've gotten into this

186
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,858
sort of a siloed environment, right? So,

187
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:39,048
so typically Splunk is used,

188
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,509
you know, within application-centric environments.

189
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,884
Typically it's used by, by. Us folks,

190
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:44,755
by infrastructure

191
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:46,165
managers,

192
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:48,776
even by security teams because Splunk

193
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,855
really excels in security and all

194
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,915
those use cases, but it's, it's more of an

195
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,634
application and infrastructure-focused

196
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,175
solution. 1000 Eyes is

197
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,204
more of a, of a network-focused solution. We

198
00:06:59,204 --> 00:06:59,834
are really

199
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,276
dedicated to assuring the connectivity

200
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,894
across the digital supply chain to

201
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:07,935
ensure that your users can reach

202
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,975
all those applications, no matter where

203
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:12,360
they are, no matter who owns. The, etc.

204
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,641
And so what we've done at Cisco is we've sort

205
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,841
of joined forces between these two

206
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,980
solutions, between Splunk observability

207
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:21,380
and 1000 eyes assurance, and we've basically

208
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,401
integrated those. And the reason we've done

209
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,521
that is to make it easier and more

210
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,651
seamless for you as an IT

211
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,002
organization to assure resilient

212
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:32,360
networks, resilient experiences, and

213
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,781
high quality end user experiences.

214
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,122
And so that's what we're going to show you today. And we've come

215
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,401
up with 3 different solutions that actually

216
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,536
show. and I'm going to demonstrate these in just a

217
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:42,338
couple of moments.

218
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,786
The first is the Cisco 1000 eyes app for

219
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,898
Splunk. And if you're familiar with Splunk, you know that

220
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,166
Splunk maintains a vast

221
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:51,966
store or a library of applications

222
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,827
that's really built on a system called Splunkbase.

223
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,367
And then Splunkbase is, what that is, is, is it really

224
00:07:57,588 --> 00:07:59,726
Splunk has intelligence and tooling

225
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,226
that allows you to take the data that's collected

226
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:04,528
within Splunk and build custom applications.

227
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:06,937
And so what we've done is we've built a custom

228
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:07,666
application for Splunk.

229
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,014
Called the Cisco 1000 Eyes app

230
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:12,014
for Splunk, that's located in

231
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:14,052
Splunk Base, so you can download it and start using

232
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,653
it right away if you're a Splunk customer.

233
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,523
Um, and I'm gonna show you what that looks like.

234
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:20,252
Basically, what it does is it takes metrics

235
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:20,834
and data,

236
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,514
performance metrics, primarily network telemetry,

237
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:26,052
and exports it, uh, via API

238
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:28,213
and open telemetry, um, into the Splunk

239
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:28,954
dashboard.

240
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,574
The second solution that we have is

241
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:33,874
an integration between 1000 Eyes

242
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,692
and Splunk Observability Cloud.

243
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,399
So again, what we do is, is we export

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,658
our data into, uh,

245
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:42,759
uh Splunk's got something called the Common

246
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,678
Information Model or the CIM,

247
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
you know, where we basically map our telemetry

248
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,070
and map all those parameters into

249
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,119
their into the database so that you can

250
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,359
now, uh, display thousandized

251
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,710
telemetry within Splunk and vice versa.

252
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,080
So these, these are bi-directional integrations, meaning

253
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,298
if you're a Splunk customer, you can view 1000

254
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,479
eyes telemetry in Splunk.

255
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,798
If you're a 1000 eyes customer, you can

256
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:06,048
view. Splunk metrics,

257
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,849
events, traces,

258
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:08,840
logs

259
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,320
within 1000 eyes. And then finally, we have

260
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,058
something called Splunk ITSI

261
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,658
bidirectional integration.

262
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
IT service intelligence from Splunk

263
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,139
essentially is a machine learning. It's a, it's

264
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,779
really an AI ops tool that does automatic

265
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,259
preventative, uh, proactive correlation

266
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,548
of all the data that's collected within Splunk,

267
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,019
um, and then shows it in a dashboard. And

268
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,654
so, again, what we're doing is we're We're exporting

269
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,864
1000 Eyes network telemetry, uh,

270
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:36,033
into Splunk ITSI so that you can view

271
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,913
incidents there.

272
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,433
We've also got links from 1000 Eyes

273
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,433
directly into Splunk ITSI.

274
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:44,274
So if you identify an issue with an

275
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:46,474
application, you basically eliminated the network

276
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,474
as the culprit. You can then go

277
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,654
directly into Splunk ITSI and,

278
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,994
and see essentially a preventative or

279
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,033
recommendations for exactly how to

280
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,154
rectify that problem.

281
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:58,558
So let's go ahead and, uh, and show

282
00:09:58,859 --> 00:09:59,798
these demos.

283
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:02,460
So this is actually the, this is the,

284
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,719
um, the T1 1000 Eyes application for Splunk.

285
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,969
This combines deep visibility with AI driven

286
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:09,080
insights. And what you're basically seeing here,

287
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,119
you're actually in Splunk right now,

288
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,500
um, but what, you're in Splunk Enterprise, and

289
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
you're seeing tests that 1000 Eyes have

290
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,279
run. And you can see

291
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,859
you've got network latency, you've got network loss,

292
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,275
network. Jitter, and we're actually, we

293
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,875
have the ability to display that by

294
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,955
application. So we can identify the application and we can

295
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:28,375
see here that there's some consistent

296
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,575
packet loss, some consistent latency

297
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:31,535
within the network.

298
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,264
So from there, we can link directly into 1000

299
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:36,315
Eyes, and this is a 1 1000 Eyes test

300
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,926
view where we can show that, that, that, that availability

301
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,926
dropped. We drop into a 1000

302
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:41,975
eyes path visualization.

303
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,761
And we can identify very, very quickly that there's

304
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,971
high latency on this, on this network

305
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:49,251
transit link, and there's also packet loss

306
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,150
happening in the network,

307
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,932
both at the intermediate node and also

308
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,971
at the node that's in the destination network.

309
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:57,491
And so, right away, we can see

310
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,730
from what we got in through the Spunk

311
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,822
application, jump from Splunk into 1000

312
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,900
eyes and quickly move to diagnose

313
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,980
and resolve the issue.

314
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:06,552
Now, this is actually

315
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:08,980
the second one. This is basically the ITSI

316
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,692
integration.

317
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,369
Um, actually, this is, yeah, this is actually, I'm

318
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,149
sorry, this is the Cisco 1000

319
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,609
integration with Spunk observability cloud.

320
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,460
And what this is starting is we're actually in the 1000I

321
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,570
platform, and on this particular test, we

322
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,808
see that server application availability

323
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,279
has dropped precipitously.

324
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,649
Now we can go into our connect phases.

325
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,830
We can see that DNS resolved. We've got

326
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,849
connection, we've got send and receive, but

327
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,928
we've got HTTP errors, meaning

328
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,048
the application, the page really can't load for that

329
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:38,404
end user, and they're Probably going to log a call

330
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:39,543
and complain about that.

331
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,965
So what we do from here is we actually

332
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,085
can bring up within

333
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:44,724
1000 eyes,

334
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,065
uh, a service map, and we can basically

335
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:49,543
see high latency across this

336
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,585
transit, and we can see

337
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,734
a lot of, a lot of the metrics that are associated

338
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,320
with that. And we're able to jump directly

339
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,369
from this particular service map

340
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,149
and look at the trace. We can see that, that availability

341
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,469
has dropped to 0. We've got high latency

342
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,340
on that link, basically 2 seconds,

343
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:07,750
and we can see the status code. This is

344
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,950
all, again, built into 1000 eyes. And

345
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,029
then from there, we basically open up the

346
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,114
trace. Within Splunk, we can show that

347
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,514
within Splunk and then move very, very quickly

348
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,134
towards a resolution. So now

349
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:20,394
we've seamlessly moved into Splunk.

350
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,994
We can basically see the traces here, OK?

351
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:25,274
And we can look at what's happening on

352
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:27,494
the, on the front end. And then in the API

353
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:29,533
list, we have 500 errors pretty much

354
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,494
all along the way.

355
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:32,908
We can then take that and then we can get

356
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:35,070
more information. We can actually look

357
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,349
at the stack trace, and we can identify

358
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:39,369
that there's an issue with the JSON code, you

359
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,379
know, within that trace. And then from that, we

360
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,428
can actually give that to our developers. They

361
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,288
can fix the issue

362
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,649
and move forward from there.

363
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,649
So again, this is really showing sort of a seamless

364
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,908
integration between all the

365
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:52,899
network telemetry, the 1000 eyes. Delivers

366
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,519
along with the visibility into applications and infrastructure

367
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,529
that Splunk delivers, all done in a very

368
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,558
seamless way. And the great thing about this is

369
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,590
you can take snapshots of these tests and,

370
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,639
and of these results and basically share them

371
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,840
with your stakeholders. You can share them with

372
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,149
third-party service providers or your cloud

373
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,369
providers as a way to sort of move towards,

374
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,019
again, a rapid and, and, and proactive

375
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:13,960
remediation.

376
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,359
OK, so what's next for you guys? Because my

377
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,219
talk is pretty much coming to a close now.

378
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,808
Um, even though I, I, I still do have some time

379
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:22,849
left. Um, but basically what we want you to

380
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,149
do, and, and I'm, by the way, I'm happy to take

381
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,408
questions from any of you afterwards. I'm gonna be

382
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,450
in the Splunk Cisco booth

383
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,070
right over there. I'm pointing at it.

384
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,330
Um, we have a demo pod over there. You can come and

385
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,288
I can show any of this to you there.

386
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,908
Happy to answer all your questions.

387
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,570
Happy to show you demos.

388
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:41,183
Um, but you can also, if you visit our booth,

389
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,614
if you attend one of our theater presentations there,

390
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:46,114
if you get some demos, we'll give you these really

391
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:48,315
cool collector pins. We've got some really cool

392
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,354
collector pins, I'll tell you.

393
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:51,634
And you get two of those, and you can take those up to

394
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,715
our desk and our, and our booth staff will basically give

395
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:55,134
you, um, a really cool,

396
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,474
um, and pithy sort of a t-shirt, kind

397
00:13:57,474 --> 00:13:58,654
of like the one I'm wearing here.

398
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:01,288
The second thing you can do at our booth is basically talk

399
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,489
with an expert. So all the subject matter experts,

400
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,639
now, I'm actually with Cisco 1000

401
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,928
Eyes, so I can talk fairly intelligently

402
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,928
about 1000 Eyes, but I'm a lot less

403
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:12,048
intelligent when it comes to Splunk and all the

404
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,019
great things that they do.

405
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:15,489
So, but we have subject matter experts, not

406
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,489
only with Splunk 1 1000 Eyes, but we've got,

407
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,330
we've got experts in collaboration,

408
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,889
security, and all the other great things that Cisco

409
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,889
does across the board. Um, so we

410
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,894
really encourage you to visit our booth. And learn more

411
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:26,695
from our experts.

412
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:27,815
And then lastly,

413
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:30,264
uh, from 1000 eyes standpoint, we, we

414
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,195
do offer a free trial of our platform.

415
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,445
By default. It's a 15-day free trial,

416
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,844
but depending on the service that you're, that you're

417
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:38,335
actually, um, onboarding,

418
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:40,663
we can actually extend that as well. So,

419
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,715
sign up for a free trial. Just don't tell,

420
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,173
uh, the bean counters that, uh, that we're letting you do

421
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:46,923
that. So, uh, you know, you might get a,

422
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,654
we might get some nasty sort of stink eye looks

423
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:51,094
from, uh, from the accounting department.

424
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:53,580
Um, anyway, so I still have 5

425
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,158
minutes left,

426
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:56,779
um, but that's all for my presentation

427
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,000
today. I hope this has been informative on some level.

428
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,479
We're really looking towards,

429
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,619
you know, this new normal, right? Where, where,

430
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:06,418
the, the way that we used to operate, the

431
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:08,460
way that we used to manage, the tools that we used

432
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,469
to use are We're all basically going

433
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:12,469
away. We're moving towards a much more

434
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:14,908
AI driven, machine learning-driven, predictive

435
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:15,649
kind of an approach.

436
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,210
That's the goal here. And I hope that you are

437
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,369
all able to attain that and, uh,

438
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,428
and give your end users the higher, the highest

439
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,178
possible experiences that they can achieve.

440
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,548
So, thank you very much and hope to see you

441
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:27,288
over at the booth.
