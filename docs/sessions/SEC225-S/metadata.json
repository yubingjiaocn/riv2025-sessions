  "abstract": "Enterprises often withhold sensitive data from AI models due to risk, which can result in limited business insights. This session explores how tokenization can address this challenge by securing training and response data, which renders the data useless to unauthorized access and potential exposure while preserving its analytical value. Attendees will gain insights from Capital One’s large-scale tokenization implementation, along with actionable strategies, architectural patterns, and implementation blueprints for applying tokenization within complex AWS environments. You'll leave with actionable guidance for securing diverse AI-driven use cases at scale. This presentation is brought to you by Capital One, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "企业通常因风险考虑而不向AI模型提供敏感数据，这可能导致业务洞察受限。本次会议探讨了如何通过令牌化来应对这一挑战，通过保护训练和响应数据来确保数据安全，使数据对未经授权的访问和潜在泄露变得无用，同时保持其分析价值。与会者将从Capital One的大规模令牌化实施中获得洞察，以及在复杂AWS环境中应用令牌化的可行策略、架构模式和实施蓝图。您将获得在规模化保护多样化AI驱动用例的可行指导。本演示由AWS合作伙伴Capital One提供。",
