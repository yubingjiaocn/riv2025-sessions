1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,590
All right. Welcome everybody.

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:04,000
If you have your headphones on or maybe you

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,038
can hear my voice, uh, but, but thank you all for,

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,959
for being here.

5
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:09,478
This title of the, of this talk is, uh,

6
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:11,810
Build a multi-channel agentic Experience

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,108
with Twilio and AWS.

8
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:16,920
Uh, the first thing to point out is we have people from

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,179
both Twilio and AWS

10
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,219
on the stage. So this is a

11
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,638
collaborative effort. We've been working

12
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,859
together for the last year figuring out how to build

13
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,280
agentic solutions, how to build

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,829
cool stuff with both of our platforms,

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,200
and the talk today is, is the result

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,259
of, of that effort.

17
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:39,009
Uh, I'm Dan Bartlett. I'm a principal

18
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:39,750
solutions architect

19
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,929
at Twillo.

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,009
I'm Brandon Hawkins. I'm a lead PM at Tulio

21
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:44,658
for Voice AI,

22
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,289
and I'm Cameron Keene, a solution architect at

23
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,048
AWS.

24
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,048
Awesome. So that's the team again, Tulo and AWS

25
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:53,069
working together to, to make cool stuff.

26
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,020
Uh, I'm gonna read that title again.

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,439
Uh, build a multi-channel agentic

28
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,439
experience with Twilio

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,719
and AWS.

30
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,448
What does that really mean? We, we see agentic

31
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,698
on every, everything in the expo.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,698
Um, I guess saying it in another way,

33
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,138
we wanted to show how

34
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:15,159
to build an application using

35
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,198
Twilio and AWS

36
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:19,799
that allows your users to interact

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,099
with the channel of their choice.

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,359
Uh, so, so the obvious channels

39
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,180
that we're gonna cover today are of course

40
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,260
voice,

41
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:28,099
uh, SMS, messaging,

42
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,219
uh, and email.

43
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,680
So, so that's what we've built.

44
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,838
Um, and, and also kind of allow them to

45
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,918
switch between the two, so we, we all

46
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:38,000
have kind of applications. Hey, it's a voice application or

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
it's an email application, but what about

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,040
being able to switch between the two channels, and

49
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,558
we think this is what people want

50
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,099
and certainly what is possible to build,

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,278
uh, with, with the tools that are available

52
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:51,088
today. Uh,

53
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,448
so what does this look like? Um, yeah, this

54
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,308
is probably one of the more

55
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,010
simple architectural diagrams,

56
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,209
uh, that you'll get this week, but, but really what we have

57
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,510
is we have your customers,

58
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,409
uh, talking to you or communicating

59
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,459
with you over voice, over

60
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,300
email, over messaging, you know, to

61
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,110
your application,

62
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:13,189
all backed, uh, by an LLM,

63
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,409
uh, so.

64
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,088
You know, it does get more complicated than

65
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,868
this, I promise, but if you don't remember

66
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,409
anything else from the slide, this is what

67
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,330
we're putting together.

68
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,139
Uh, so what are some of the principles

69
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,960
or what are some of the important points of a multi-channel

70
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,118
agentic application,

71
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,558
you know, what should it look like?

72
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,300
Uh, the 1st 3 are, I have

73
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,360
3 choices and, and a principle to kind of

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,669
out there, and, and the first choice is, is

75
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,979
channel, you know, we, we think that your customers,

76
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,719
your users wanna be able to use

77
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,419
voice messaging. There are different varieties of

78
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,219
voice, the different varieties of messaging

79
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,819
and email. We think email is a, is a great

80
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,979
channel. We'll talk about that more, but it's a

81
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,439
channel that that your customers wanna use.

82
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,429
Uh, choice with your speech

83
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,528
to text providers, your text

84
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:00,649
to speech providers, we think that's also important

85
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,808
because that might, that's gonna vary depending on your

86
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,389
needs

87
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,929
and same with, uh, with model with the

88
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:06,819
LLM model.

89
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:09,250
And lastly, kind of a principle and drive

90
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,788
you've done

91
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,368
been doing software development as long as me, you know, don't

92
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,490
repeat yourself. You should be able to build

93
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,800
this in a way, uh, that has, uh,

94
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,088
that has reusable components where all these

95
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,270
channels and all these models can, can work together.

96
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:24,360
Um, so what does this look like?

97
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,808
So this is kind of a conceptual diagram,

98
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:27,639
you know, that we

99
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:30,199
put together as we were kind of building this out. Like,

100
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,368
here are the different layers, and this is our opinion on

101
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:33,149
how we think

102
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,610
this can be built, uh, so with the intent

103
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,669
here is to have this be helpful for you guys

104
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,050
to have model your own applications. So kind of

105
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,669
going from the top down, it all starts

106
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:44,080
with your users, which is where it

107
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,088
should always start.

108
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,740
Uh, the next one is gonna be the channels.

109
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,179
Uh, so for us and for this talk that's

110
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,258
gonna be voice,

111
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,038
uh, messaging, uh, and, and email,

112
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,889
and then API layer is next. Uh,

113
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,020
you gotta have a way for bidirectional

114
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,278
communication, so the channels need to communicate

115
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,399
with you with your app. Your app needs to communicate

116
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,219
with the channels.

117
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,899
The meat of it is, is the, the centerpiece,

118
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,838
the agent application and data.

119
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,099
Are what you guys, you know, wanna concentrate

120
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,139
most of your time on, uh, so, so that's

121
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,170
your agent application. Uh, this is where

122
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,178
your business logic, uh, resides. This

123
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,319
is how you interact with the data,

124
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,178
uh, so certainly identity resolution

125
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,220
and context are, are important factors

126
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,160
when building these, these applications.

127
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,699
Uh, the agent framework, there's a lot of neat tools

128
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,699
out there that I'm sure you guys are aware of to kind

129
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,259
of help you build agentic experiences.

130
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,108
A service layer we'll talk about and and

131
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,269
lastly, you know, the model, the large language model.

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,689
Uh, these are the pieces that we

133
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,809
used for this

134
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,970
application. So now, of course we, we understand there may

135
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,970
be something different for what you guys wanna use,

136
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:50,670
but this is how we build it. This is our

137
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,290
recommendation on, on, on a solution.

138
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,139
Um, and we're gonna go through these all in

139
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,259
more details, but certainly you're recognizing the

140
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,649
channels from Twilio,

141
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,939
uh, the, all the different compute products and the

142
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,100
data products, uh, from AWS.

143
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,500
Uh, I will say this is an instance where our,

144
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,579
our segment product can be plugged in

145
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:11,500
for helping with, uh, all the user

146
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,778
focused data,

147
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,259
uh, and then agent frameworks and of course the models

148
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:15,819
down below.

149
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,798
Uh, so I'm gonna pass it over to, to Brandon.

150
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,928
There you go. I'm gonna hit the button for you. Thank you, Dan.

151
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,220
So this segues well into

152
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,488
what does Twilio do and why are we here. Let's

153
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:28,798
talk about that a little bit more.

154
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,088
This image, uh, that Dan showed is, is

155
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:33,259
relatively simple, but it's a lot harder

156
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,269
than it looks,

157
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:35,250
and, um,

158
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,309
businesses are struggling to build,

159
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:38,329
um,

160
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,759
amazing engagement, and it's, it's very hard to do that.

161
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:42,928
And these are, you know, 4 reasons why we think it's

162
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:43,750
hard to do that,

163
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,389
um, you know, consumer expectation has evolved.

164
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,048
They want brands to remember them across channels

165
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,509
and interactions, but that's very hard to do,

166
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,889
um. And that's because data

167
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,209
lives in different silos,

168
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,750
um, you know, and, and there's

169
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,088
fragmented experiences across these channels

170
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:01,250
the channels are in isolation like I said, and switching between

171
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,170
them breaks the continuity of the experience.

172
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:06,829
And third, there's so many tools, it's

173
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,119
difficult to create like a lifelong

174
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,428
conversation or that customer connection.

175
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,309
Um, you have signals from customers, from channels,

176
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,009
from AI, and they aren't unified or activated,

177
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,509
uh, in real time, and so that limits, you know, what

178
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,509
we can do and and what kind of customer outcomes we

179
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:21,129
can drive.

180
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,480
And lastly, builders have to, you know, we always have to

181
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
make trade-offs between

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,519
uh friction and security,

183
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,160
and uh you introduce risk and frustration in the

184
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,608
process. So

185
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:34,170
why Tullio?

186
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,048
Our mission is, uh, you know,

187
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:40,369
our vision is we envision a world in which every

188
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,350
digital interaction is amazing.

189
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
And we think we sit at an

190
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,389
interesting place in the ecosystem to

191
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,269
deliver value and deserve to play here.

192
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,238
We invented the CPSS category

193
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:54,238
17 years ago. We're the #1 leader

194
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:55,819
in the market for communications.

195
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,040
We are not a foundational AI company, but

196
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,910
Amazon is,

197
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,350
and we are a developer platform, so we partner

198
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,619
very closely with all of them

199
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,059
and and can make those technologies available

200
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,759
for communications use cases.

201
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,759
And then last but not least, you know, if we wanna talk about

202
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,149
personalization and personalization at scale,

203
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,338
we have to talk about contextual data.

204
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,199
So Tulio owns segment, which is a CDP

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,238
product that Dan mentioned,

206
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,199
um, but even if it's not our CD product, CDP

207
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,439
product, you need to have this information to have a

208
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,139
direct relationship with your customer.

209
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,678
Tulio sits right in the middle of that and so that's why

210
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:30,858
we think we deserve to be here.

211
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:32,369
And look,

212
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,980
this is just a slide with a lot of logos that show

213
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,129
you we are trusted by a lot of the biggest names

214
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,119
and brands in the industry,

215
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,778
um, you know, hundreds of thousands of customers

216
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:42,899
trust us to do all of their communications

217
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,160
with all of their customers.

218
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,670
And you know, look, most importantly, it's one

219
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,689
thing to be, you know, send a couple of messages here and

220
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,108
there. It's another thing to do this at scale,

221
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,269
uh, with 99.999%

222
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,389
uptime across the busiest periods of the

223
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,709
year. And so, you know, we just had our cyber

224
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,778
week, uh, last week and,

225
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,000
uh, and, and Black Friday, and we'll have updated numbers,

226
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,649
but from last year, you know, these numbers are pretty massive.

227
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:08,670
Um, you know,

228
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,329
over almost 5000 global

229
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,269
carrier connections,

230
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,809
partnerships with all of the big companies and names

231
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,670
in the business to deliver these messages,

232
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,730
um, you know, and hundreds of thousands of customers and global

233
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,028
reach and territory and scale.

234
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:25,259
So I'm gonna hand it back to Dan uh to dig into

235
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,410
each of these channels a little further and talk about how we

236
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,850
build with them on AWS.

237
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,350
Awesome, thanks, Brandon.

238
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,729
OK, so I mentioned the channels

239
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,190
today we're gonna cover in this application of voice

240
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,109
messaging and email.

241
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,788
And we're gonna start with voice, kind of the most

242
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,629
popular and the most exciting,

243
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,989
uh, channel, uh, that, that, uh,

244
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,129
people are building agentic experiences on.

245
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:50,808
Um,

246
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,769
hopefully you recognize this as the, the Twillo

247
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:54,639
logo.

248
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,139
Uh, does anybody kind of know where it's from? I

249
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,178
know you have your headsets on. Maybe make a symbol of,

250
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,259
of what it's from. I'll, I'll have Brandon do it.

251
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,058
So it's, it's from, uh, that's a universal

252
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,548
sign for, for a phone,

253
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,048
and, and this is, um, the

254
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,178
Twilla logo was, was inspired by

255
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,580
the kind of the receiving,

256
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,009
uh, the receiver of, of

257
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,038
handsets of old school landline phones.

258
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
So really our origins are in

259
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,479
voice in 2008, kind of when we

260
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,379
were founded, we were founded as a company

261
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:25,519
that uh enabled voice

262
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,558
calls for software. So we've

263
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,038
been doing this for a long time,

264
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:30,798
uh, we're certainly good at it.

265
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:32,450
Um,

266
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,668
the other thing to say about voice,

267
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:37,389
and there's a lot of people doing voice

268
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,668
applications, uh, Twilio, uh,

269
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:42,250
enables voice over multiple

270
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,479
different channels, so there's,

271
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,269
you can call them varieties of, of voice,

272
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,889
and it's important that you kind of recognize that and

273
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,090
kind of why Twilio can certainly help with

274
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,308
all your voice applications because there is

275
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,450
the existing SIP PBX.

276
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,308
Uh, telephony systems that enterprise

277
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:00,489
and companies have that are certainly

278
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:01,989
important and will remain important.

279
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,619
There's the good old, uh, PSTN public

280
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:06,629
switch telephone network that allows that's actually

281
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,048
the phone numbers that's an important channel,

282
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,489
uh, of, of voice.

283
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,658
And then also on websites, uh, Sulo

284
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:15,950
has been doing web RTC for

285
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,950
many years now, so 2011.

286
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,029
So to point to click on a website to actually

287
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:20,750
talk to a bot.

288
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,700
Uh, and then lastly with mobile SDKs,

289
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,048
so all these different variety of voices,

290
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,269
uh, of, of voice of the voice channel

291
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,308
need to be supportive or certainly should be

292
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:32,788
supportive, and you can get them all, uh, with, with Twilio.

293
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:35,989
Um, I'm gonna pass it back to Brandon. He's gonna

294
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:38,109
talk more about, uh, conversation relay

295
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,259
and kind of Twilio's offering in,

296
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,168
uh, voice AI.

297
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:42,710
Thanks again, Dan.

298
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,308
So funny we're starting with voice

299
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,349
uh when a few years ago people said voice

300
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,649
was dead and it's kind of having a resurgence.

301
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:52,759
It's interesting. 3 years ago, almost

302
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,788
exactly, Chat GPT came out

303
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,229
and we had customers, you know, who are more

304
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,629
tech forward come to us

305
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,288
and they were stitching together

306
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,989
a speech to text vendor, a text to speech vendor,

307
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,070
and putting an LLM in the middle and

308
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,009
throwing it on a call

309
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,330
and it was pretty good

310
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,269
and there's decent demos, but we kept hearing

311
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,070
three problems over and over again.

312
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,700
Um, if you're in this space, this shouldn't be,

313
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,950
uh, a surprise,

314
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,379
and, uh, chief among them is latency.

315
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,239
There's a subjective and objective component

316
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,080
to this, so

317
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,619
objectively we think

318
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,918
if the response time in a conversation

319
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,080
is, uh, more than 1 2nd, it's

320
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,200
weird. You hit the uncanny valley

321
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,239
of like, is this a robot? I'm talking to

322
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,308
an AI agent, you're slamming 0 to speak to

323
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,139
an operator,

324
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,558
uh, so that's no good.

325
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:39,158
So, um, latency is huge. There's also

326
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,239
subjective pieces, right? So when we talk to a

327
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,418
human. Uh, like we're doing now, I

328
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:45,418
would say, uh, or give me a second while

329
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:46,580
I look that up for you,

330
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,859
um, that has to be, uh, that has to

331
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:49,678
be handled as well.

332
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,700
The second thing we heard was inflexibility,

333
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,609
lots of point solutions, lots

334
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,750
of SAS startups, lots of VC money going into this

335
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,029
space, um, but Toyota is a developer

336
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:01,548
platform,

337
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,369
and

338
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,509
it's interesting for us as product people.

339
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:07,029
Uh, our customers want that absolute

340
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,070
control, and to turn every

341
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,190
knob to deliver a great customer experience

342
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,469
on their own, and they, they weren't seeing that in the market.

343
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,658
Last but not least is orchestration. This ties

344
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:19,940
back to latency with some of the subjective pieces

345
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,029
I was talking about.

346
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,899
Um, it's non-trivial but absolutely

347
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,779
mission critical to get this piece right.

348
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,259
You have to gracefully handle interruptions.

349
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,619
You have to have accurate turn taking

350
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,820
and know when someone's done talking and

351
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,158
when you should start listening.

352
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,700
Um, these are very hard to do, like I said, and you have

353
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,399
to get them right.

354
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,210
We've been doing this for literally 17 years.

355
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:42,869
Twilio exists in voice to orchestrate

356
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:43,729
real-time media.

357
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,590
So of course I've teed up all these problems and I'm gonna

358
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,928
tell you we have a solution that we're very proud about

359
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,529
and this is called conversation relay.

360
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,519
It's a bring your own AI

361
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:56,950
to Toyo voice. It's how you build

362
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,609
voice agents with Tullio,

363
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,119
and this went to general availability

364
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,928
in March.

365
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:04,349
It's one of our fastest maturing

366
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,428
products in Tulo history, and it's one of

367
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,428
our most, it's the, it's the area we see

368
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:10,548
the most overwhelming demand at the moment.

369
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,210
What is it?

370
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,940
Uh, of course I have the, the, you know, the bullet points

371
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,960
on the slide. We'll dig in a little bit more.

372
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,668
Um, it's a super low latency,

373
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:21,690
um, way of, of building Tulio of,

374
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:24,259
of voice agents on Tulio where you

375
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:26,379
keep the things that are differentiated for your

376
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,849
business, bring the LLM,

377
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,279
um, and we'll take care of all the orchestration,

378
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:32,048
all the unsexy parts,

379
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,479
uh, that we think are sexy about voice,

380
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,719
uh, and real-time media.

381
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,288
Of course we have some niceties like interruption handling

382
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:40,340
out of the box, and we have all the best vendors on the,

383
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,080
on the platform.

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,298
So we'll zoom out again an oversimplified,

385
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,678
you know, architectural diagram. I, I hesitate

386
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:50,580
to call it that in a conference like this.

387
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,019
Uh, what, what's going on here? What is it?

388
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,548
Uh, oversimplified, right? The left side

389
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:57,710
is Twilio, the right side is you,

390
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,950
OK? And so we have a web socket that sits

391
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,580
in the middle.

392
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,190
So if you imagine we're on a live phone call,

393
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,840
we're gonna transcribe, uh, the

394
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,139
voice into text,

395
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,599
send it over the web socket.

396
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,109
You will do something with it, presumably run

397
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:13,219
it through an LLM, you know, do data dips,

398
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:14,928
send us back the response,

399
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,889
and then we will speak it into the call,

400
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:19,369
and all of this will be done in super low latency.

401
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,489
The median latency is 0.5 seconds or

402
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:22,058
less,

403
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:24,710
and um you know we're gonna do this with,

404
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:27,229
with all these great things that we have baked into the platform

405
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,149
to make your life easier as a developer,

406
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,960
uh, interruption handling, DTMF built in,

407
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,269
and like I mentioned, a variety of different

408
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,308
choices for vendors on the speech to text

409
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,190
and text to speech.

410
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,379
If I could call out like two things here that I want to hammer

411
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,369
home. One is

412
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,019
give us the things that we do, that's

413
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,139
our business, that's non-core to

414
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,629
you, which is orchestrating voice, and

415
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,668
keep all the things on the right that

416
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,788
are differentiated, right, and be able to

417
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,788
switch between these new technologies as they come

418
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,428
out and have absolute control.

419
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:59,109
Also, you probably care about where this data lives.

420
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:01,070
You have absolute control of that this way.

421
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:06,029
I mentioned the vendors for speech to text and

422
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:07,408
text to speech that we have on the platform.

423
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,950
Um, I wanna talk about, uh, our strategy there

424
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,918
a little bit and, and why,

425
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:14,250
why this is interesting at all to, to talk about.

426
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:15,609
Uh, one is, of course,

427
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:17,908
look, the, the voice that

428
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,048
you present to your customers represents your brand,

429
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:22,229
so it's the singular touch point. It matters

430
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:22,840
a lot.

431
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,190
Our strategy was basically,

432
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,590
look, let's instead of

433
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,668
having everybody on our platform,

434
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,979
there's a new TTS vendor every week on

435
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:32,590
Product Hunt and.

436
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,500
We love all of them. Um,

437
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,259
let's instead take, you know, the advantages that

438
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:39,259
Tulio has with scale and put our

439
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,298
pricing and buying power into a

440
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,320
few that we think will go the distance.

441
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,820
And so what we've done is we've, you know, we've made bets on

442
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,859
the hyper scalers like Google and Amazon, of

443
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,178
course, but also the best of breed

444
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:52,298
startups in this space that, like I said, we think

445
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:54,418
will go the distance in Deepram and 11

446
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:55,029
labs.

447
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,649
And you know we've been able to make sizable

448
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,739
sizable commitments to these vendors

449
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,899
and you know that gets us insight into

450
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,979
roadmap and influence, but it also gets

451
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,460
lower pricing and we can pass that on to our customers.

452
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,359
One last thing to say about this is, um,

453
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,840
you know, because we've been concentrated

454
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,239
in our bets, if you will,

455
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,739
we've been able to co-locate these services

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,529
um where possible

457
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,029
so that we control uh

458
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,759
every piece of it, right? We can allocate

459
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,609
the GPUs that we think are appropriate,

460
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,000
uh, we're not sharing traffic with anyone else and of course

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,940
we deliver the lowest latency possible.

462
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,399
Um, and then the last thing to say about that, you know, that

463
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,099
goes back to, to this view

464
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:38,090
is. Why

465
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,129
can Tulio do this better in lower latency than

466
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:40,639
anyone else?

467
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:42,629
The call is already on our platform.

468
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,969
So right, we've co-located these services with

469
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,168
the call media edge. You're not taking additional

470
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:48,928
hops out to other clouds.

471
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,450
No one else can do that, right, because we're the provider of the

472
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,090
communication.

473
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,879
So we just go one level deeper like what's the developer

474
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,340
experience? How do you build with this thing? What's that look like?

475
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
Um, for folks who have built with Toyo

476
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,019
before, Twimmel is our Tulio markup language.

477
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,900
If you ever wondered how do you pronounce it, it's not Twemle.

478
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,400
We apologize, it was decided 17 years

479
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,328
ago. It's Twimmel,

480
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,838
uh, but this is how you do it, and

481
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,160
the way to think about this is this is your config,

482
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,000
right? So this is pre-run time.

483
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,118
What provider do I wanna use, what languages

484
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,479
are we speaking? What voice do I wanna use?

485
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,068
We can even automatically detect the language and

486
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:27,358
switch for you. Um, but that's your pre-setup,

487
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,660
right? Like what are we gonna do?

488
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,848
The magic happens on the right via

489
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:34,328
the service provider interface or SPI

490
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:35,430
fancy name of saying

491
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,009
we've defined some events that we will send

492
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:38,588
each other

493
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,309
live during the call

494
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,049
and this is really, really powerful so you know we'll

495
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,130
tell you there's an interruption, right, so you can manage the

496
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,848
context.

497
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:48,368
You can also change the language on the fly.

498
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,689
You can temporarily pause the ability to

499
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,759
interrupt. Maybe you need to play an

500
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,828
audio file that says

501
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,588
uh this call is being recorded for

502
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:57,809
you know whatever training purposes.

503
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,400
Um, there's a lot of really cool developer

504
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,500
niceties that are baked into the platform that we can do

505
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:03,640
in real time.

506
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,900
Last but not least, I'm not going to play the audio file

507
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,338
here, but we have a variety of fine tuning

508
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,479
controls. I've mentioned all of our customers really love

509
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,279
to turn all the knobs and dials.

510
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:19,539
This is very important when you're speaking to different

511
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,880
customers in different languages in different regions

512
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,769
that you don't butcher their name or a

513
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:25,618
product like a medical.

514
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,943
Product and so we have uh ability to

515
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:30,104
fine tune those those things with SML and

516
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:30,743
phonemes.

517
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,184
Um, an example here that you know

518
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:34,564
I won't share is, you know,

519
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,025
if, if we were in Ireland, which we were in,

520
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:39,265
uh, we were in London a few weeks ago giving

521
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,265
a talk, um, you know, we might have a friend named

522
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:43,265
Sheena and it's spelled S I N

523
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,693
E, um,

524
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,483
you know, if you don't use this,

525
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:47,953
uh, it will say Sine

526
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:49,434
or Sine,

527
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:52,243
but, uh, with this, uh,

528
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,904
control we can now say it, you know, correctly, Shina.

529
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,630
OK, so that was conversation relay.

530
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,269
Um, that's how you build voice AI agents on Twilio.

531
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,430
We talked a lot about the voice agent building

532
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,689
aspect. Now you've got it up and running,

533
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,949
it's talking to your customers, it's, it's, it's,

534
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,049
it's in, it's at scale.

535
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,979
Uh, now what? Well, the next thing you

536
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,180
should be caring about is observability, right?

537
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,979
We need to see inside the black box of automation.

538
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:22,318
And we think of this, uh, in

539
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,459
two different kind of pillars or buckets.

540
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:26,789
Uh, the first one is table stakes, metrics,

541
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:27,750
telemetry,

542
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,279
what was the latency, was their

543
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:30,949
jitter,

544
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,479
um, etc. etc.

545
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,140
It it, it sounds trivial, but you have to have those things

546
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,779
to debug and deliver a great experience.

547
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,578
The second is this more high level business

548
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:42,739
intelligence like what was the customer

549
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:43,338
sentiment,

550
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:45,660
um, was a competitor mentioned? Did

551
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,068
the, did the bot hallucinate,

552
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,880
and these are really powerful things that we could do

553
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,059
uh on Tulio.

554
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,969
And I'll walk you through like what are the names of those things at

555
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,789
Toleo and the products that we have.

556
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,969
Voice Insights is our flagship troubleshooting

557
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,009
product, um,

558
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:02,368
uh, and it's evolving from more of

559
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,449
a metrics, you know,

560
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,368
product to, to do really cool things like aggregation

561
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:08,608
and showing, uh, trends that are happening

562
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,848
across, uh, varieties of calls or different

563
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,309
customers or different regions.

564
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,809
You can measure end to end latency across text

565
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,130
to speech, speech to text,

566
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:17,729
uh, the network, etc.

567
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,239
And um you know this is now

568
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,358
available with conversation relay directly

569
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,759
integrated in a pilot

570
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,439
if you're Tullio customer, talk to your account rep we'll get you

571
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,838
access uh uh immediately, and

572
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,880
this will go uh more publicly available in

573
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,959
the the beginning of the year.

574
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:36,630
I also mentioned right this other side, this higher

575
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,670
level business intelligence. Let's talk about that for

576
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,910
a bit. So Tullio has a

577
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,949
product called Conversational intelligence. If

578
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:45,219
you've been a customer or aware of Tulo for a while,

579
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,509
we had sort of our own siloed data

580
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,989
problems where we had a messaging insights

581
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,150
product, a voice insights product, uh, a voice

582
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,328
intelligence product, and, um,

583
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,769
back in May again

584
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,309
this went GA as conversational intelligence

585
00:20:58,309 --> 00:20:59,250
where we unified

586
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,098
an omni-channel intelligence observability

587
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:04,368
solution. Um, and

588
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,969
this is again, did the customer ask to be transferred?

589
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,449
Uh, did the bot hallucinate? Did the agent

590
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:10,769
achieve the desired goal?

591
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:13,390
And, um, super powerful using

592
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,890
a mix of pre-built language operators

593
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,890
and you can custom write your own.

594
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:19,989
Uh, we have LLM behind the scenes

595
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,489
and you could format the output through an API,

596
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,489
get events triggered exactly the way you want.

597
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,118
If you like UIs, we have this experience in the console,

598
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,890
you can do that too.

599
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,660
The one thing to call out here is that

600
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:35,279
this is all after the fact like

601
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,239
how does this work?

602
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,598
You have to have a transcript, so you have to have

603
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,670
a message that's in text you have to have a

604
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,729
voice call that's been transcribed you have to have the text,

605
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,180
right? And then we can run language operators on it,

606
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,759
um, and so you know, up until

607
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,880
now we've been very limited with regards

608
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,000
to uh how you can use it still

609
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,598
powerful

610
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,199
and we're very excited to announce here uh

611
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,318
on stage that it is now in the real time

612
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:58,949
domain and available on a pilot.

613
00:21:59,338 --> 00:22:01,509
Uh, and it will be more publicly available at

614
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:02,598
the beginning of next year.

615
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,269
So now that we can do this, we can run these operators

616
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,509
in real time, right? And that's very, very powerful

617
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,618
in terms of, uh, automating AI agent

618
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:10,289
experiences,

619
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:12,568
um, AB testing against your humans,

620
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,828
and um we're really excited about this.

621
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,568
OK, before I give it back to Dan, um,

622
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,309
we, we, we had, uh,

623
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,858
we've gotten a lot of questions and we kinda wanna ad lib

624
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:27,209
here just a second if you, if you give me some grace,

625
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,509
uh, uh, during the week about,

626
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,219
hey, you guys are talking a lot about voice AI agents,

627
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,348
you're talking about speech to text, text to

628
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:36,430
speech. What about speech to speech?

629
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:37,449
I've heard this is a thing.

630
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,949
What about multi-modal models? So let's, let's

631
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:42,049
talk about that for just a second. Um,

632
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:44,709
I am personally as excited about it as, as

633
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:45,588
many of you might be.

634
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,380
Um, the promise,

635
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,618
let me back up just a second.

636
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:52,049
The text to speech, speech to text architecture

637
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,880
is called the cascade model,

638
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,180
uh, because we're cascading through the pipeline,

639
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,709
and this new speech to speech model

640
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,719
eliminates text to speech and speech to

641
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,868
text so the the LLM does it all,

642
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,588
right? It's expanded to do both, both sides

643
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,029
uh of the of the coin.

644
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,449
This is exciting because, uh,

645
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,489
right, theoretically you have the

646
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,170
lowest possible latency because you've eliminated

647
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,348
parts of the, the pipe.

648
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:17,910
Um, it eliminates complexity as well.

649
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:20,559
But it, but it preserves uh

650
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,709
sentiment and, and tone

651
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,809
and um emotion better because

652
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,269
it stays in audio.

653
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:28,890
The LLM can process audio directly.

654
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:30,289
Um,

655
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,459
and so that's very exciting. It's very promising.

656
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,779
So what I would want to say on this is it's very early

657
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,868
days. Tullio always, you know, especially

658
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,979
as a product person, we always wanna be able to

659
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:40,979
say yes to customers. So if a customer wants to

660
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:43,049
come and build on us and you want to use the latest

661
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:44,598
and greatest, we're gonna say yes.

662
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:47,259
So we have a product in this space

663
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,559
that's also in pilot,

664
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:51,059
and, um, and we're really excited about that.

665
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,318
We wanna be ready

666
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,039
because the second thing, which is the takeaway,

667
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:56,500
is we don't think it's ready yet.

668
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,930
Super excited. It's not the recommended

669
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,108
way of going to production at scale

670
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:04,390
with voice AI agents yet,

671
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,848
and the primary reason for that is that businesses

672
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:07,670
run on text.

673
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,828
And so if you need to prevent the bot from hallucinating

674
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:13,469
or you know speaking something you don't want said into

675
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,608
the call, you cannot interrupt that if it's

676
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:16,539
an audio stream.

677
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,059
And if you do, it'll say something before you can

678
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:19,630
stop it.

679
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,809
Some other reasons are it's very expensive,

680
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,969
although I think we know how technology works that will come

681
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,328
down over time.

682
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,500
And um you know

683
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,068
you you have less control

684
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,989
because you're locked into a particular ecosystem.

685
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,969
So with the Cascade model you could pick a TTS vendor,

686
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:38,469
you could pick an STT vendor,

687
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,809
you could pick a communications vendor, you could pick

688
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:41,509
an LLM.

689
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,068
So if you go speech to speech you're all in

690
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:44,769
on the LLM,

691
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,049
right? You don't have the, you have the choices they have and

692
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:47,689
that's what you get.

693
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,368
I'm gonna speak out of both sides of my mouth again. We're

694
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:53,469
excited about it. It's just not there yet

695
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,650
and so I'm gonna leave you with when that

696
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,799
day comes, we have a product and we will, we

697
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,630
will be ready for it.

698
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,229
All right, I won't opine anymore about the future

699
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:05,608
of tech. Uh, let me hand it back over to Dan

700
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,868
and Cameron to talk about how do we actually

701
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:10,269
build these production scale systems on,

702
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,348
uh, ADS and Toyo today. Awesome, thanks,

703
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,469
Brandon. Uh, so Brandon showed

704
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:16,519
a high level architecture diagram. This

705
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,549
is a little bit deeper. It's been on the screen for

706
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,739
a little bit. Uh, but essentially a

707
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:22,880
call comes in from the Twilio platform.

708
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,400
This is a post call.

709
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:27,039
It goes to your application where it

710
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,689
then goes back and it initiates that

711
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:32,259
conversation relay session. That's the web socket

712
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,420
speech to text, text to speech cascade

713
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,439
model that Brandon talked about.

714
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,529
Uh, the text is sent back to your

715
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:41,660
application where you're gonna get context and you're gonna

716
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,789
get. Uh, your interaction with the

717
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,078
prompt and, and with Bedrock,

718
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,019
you're gonna send the stream the text back to

719
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:50,449
conversation relay and where we turn that text

720
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,250
into speech.

721
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,828
Uh, so we, we'll go even further later in

722
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:56,509
the talk, uh, with the architecture diagram.

723
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:59,029
Also we'll mention that this works with

724
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,390
certainly other any compute. So you, we've, we've

725
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,390
built this using EC2. We built

726
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,449
this using containers. So a lot of options here.

727
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,059
We're hoping to kind of give you guys some guidance on, on

728
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,549
how you could build your own solution.

729
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,189
Uh, all right, so let's get to a, a, a demo

730
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:15,390
and, and Cameron's been here for a little while. Cameron,

731
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,430
you're ready? Yep. All right, there you go. All

732
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,989
right, thanks, Sam.

733
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,539
All right, so you've seen a lot.

734
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,689
uh Dan showed us the architecture diagram.

735
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,588
Brandon talked about conversation relay.

736
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:27,118
So, let's actually see what an application looks

737
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,338
like using both conversation relay

738
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,338
and the AWS infrastructure.

739
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,338
So here I have a conversational helper

740
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:36,630
bot to give you information about reinvent.

741
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,769
So let's take a listen.

742
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,039
Hello, I'm Reinvent 2025 Helperbot.

743
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,500
How can I help you today?

744
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,078
Can you tell me about the replay party? I heard a lot

745
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:49,799
about dodgeball.

746
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:53,578
OK, let me look into the details of the replay

747
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,219
party for you.

748
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,660
The replay party is a big end of conference

749
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,858
celebration on Thursday, December 4th

750
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,939
from 7:30 p.m. to midnight at the Las

751
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:03,430
Vegas Festival Grounds. Some of the key details.

752
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,289
Entertainment. Two main stages with live

753
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,410
bands, a silent disco with AR

754
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,769
integration activities dodgeball,

755
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,930
button mash, ping pong, enhanced

756
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,729

themed lounges,

760
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:21,858
complimentary shuttle service from R,

761
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:24,368
Invent hotels starting at 7 p.m. The

762
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:26,368
dodgeball activity sounds like it will be a lot of

763
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,529
fun. Let me know if you need any other details

764
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,500
about the replay party.

765
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,170
Yeah, that sounds great, but I actually need to go

766
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,400
learn something first before having fun at the replay

767
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,709
party. OK,

768
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:39,068
got it. Let's take a look at some of the learning sessions

769
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:41,299
you might be interested in before the replay party.

770
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:43,709
Based on your interest in serverless, here are

771
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,910
some recommended tell me about Mandalay

772
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,848
Bay on Thursday.

773
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:50,509
OK, let me check on the Mandalay Bay venue

774
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,549
and any sessions happening there on Thursday.

775
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,828
Based on the search results, it looks like there

776
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:56,828
are a few sessions happening at the Mandalay Bay

777
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:59,390

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,098
the Mandalay Bay.

789
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,358
Lightning Theater seems to be hosting a number of the

790
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:25,479
shorter 20 minute lightning talk sessions on

791
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:25,989
Thursday.

792
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,598
Yeah, let me know if I want to attend that sage maker session.

793
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:32,430
OK, got it. The Sagemaker session you're

794
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,529
interested in is the session you're interested

795
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,959

slick deals AI powered deal text me all this

800
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,368
information. OK,

801
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,729
let me summarize the key details about the Sage

802
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,890
maker session you're interested in and send

803
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,088
them to you via text.

804
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:52,559
Done. I've sent that to you.

805
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,568
Is there anything else I can help you with?

806
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,529
Nope, that's it.

807
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:58,848
OK, no problem.

808
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,118
OK, so what did we just see?

809
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,959
We saw dual channel streaming between

810
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,838
conversation relay that converted speech to text

811
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,118
and text to speech

812
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,779
between an AI agent running on an EC2

813
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:11,910
using Bedrock.

814
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,739
As you can see, I asked the questions about the replay

815
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:15,959
party. It knew

816
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:18,568
the details about the replay party. I asked about sessions.

817
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:20,858
It gave me a list of sessions. I could dive deeper

818
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,410
on specific locations,

819
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:23,920
times and dates.

820
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,380
And then I asked,

821
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,818
OK, this is great, but can you send me a text message

822
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:28,900
so I can save this for later.

823
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,568
So we're able to induce using

824
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,469
voice, text and email a

825
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:36,769
seamless multi-channel experience achieving

826
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:39,229
subsecond latency on that.

827
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,759
So let's dive a little deeper on agents.

828
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,299
So agents in a nutshell.

829
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:47,559
So, as you saw,

830
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,180
uh, we had a prompt for our agent, so it's a helper

831
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,799
agent where we define goals and instructions

832
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:53,459
on

833
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,920
being a helpful assistant to the replay party

834
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,769
to give details about sessions,

835
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,039
about the replay party and just reinvent in general.

836
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
And then beyond that we had tools, so

837
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,170
as we saw it sent us a text message.

838
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:07,689
So we have 3

839
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,608
different voice channel tools

840
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:12,390
we have SMS, we have voice,

841
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,509
and we have email

842
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:15,848
and so when I said hey please send me a text message,

843
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,289
the agent recognized the

844
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:21,250
user was referencing the SMS tool

845
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,799
and it was able to send a text message in the background

846
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,689
without exiting the main voice conversation.

847
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:27,979
And then we have our context

848
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,250
where I started diving deeper on

849
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,400
the sessions and the specific locations

850
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:34,729
and we have a knowledge based

851
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:35,789
tool running

852
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,250
asynchronous as well to look

853
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,650
up in your knowledge base defined in Bedrock.

854
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,019
So let me dive.

855
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:45,430
So this is like a high level architecture diagram

856
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,130
of the agent itself.

857
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,739
So as I mentioned, we had 4 tools. We had our 4

858
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:51,170
communication channel tools

859
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,000
text, call, and email

860
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,009
where users can say, hey, send me a text,

861
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,890
or can you call me with this information,

862
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,539
or can you send me an email, as you'll see later in our

863
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:00,170
demos

864
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,250
and then we have the knowledge-based search tool.

865
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:03,779
So why do we have

866
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:06,469
these 4 tools as separate tools and not

867
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:07,509
built in within the agent?

868
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,439
So in a main voice product like this,

869
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,660
achieving subsecond latency

870
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:13,618
is the main

871
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:14,689
challenge,

872
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:16,500
so we wanted to

873
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,259
Define tools as asynchronous tool calls

874
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,400
to not block the main communication channel.

875
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:25,219
And the same thing with the knowledge-based search and the other channels.

876
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,618
So this is great, but this seems

877
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:29,199
very complex.

878
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:31,949
And so

879
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:34,578
managing the context, managing tools,

880
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,949
if you start going multi-agent, how do you

881
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:38,868
orchestrate it and the collaboration between the two?

882
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,910
This is where open source frameworks come into

883
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,068
play, so we have strands, we

884
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,348
have lang chain, lane graph and crew

885
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:48,430
AI. They help do the heavy lifting

886
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,469
of writing all the manual code you have

887
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:51,630
to do to manage this.

888
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,660
OK, this is great. You're able to build your agents

889
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,920
to do all the tasks you need,

890
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,439
but where do you go from there?

891
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,180
How do you host this at scale?

892
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:01,890
And that's where Agent Core comes into play.

893
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:04,338
So we showed our previous architecture

894
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:05,618
with EC2.

895
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:08,598
So if you still wanna run them on your own hosted

896
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:09,689
infrastructure, you can,

897
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,519
but with the new launches and Agent core runtime

898
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,799
with dual channel streaming, this enables

899
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,959
this entire architecture that you saw earlier to

900
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,380
also be deployed on Agent Core,

901
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,559
uh, the entire Agent core family.

902
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,680
So we have our framework that we built

903
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:25,838
uh in Lang chain in the previous example

904
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,420
and then we can deploy that to agent core runtime.

905
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,068
And with the

906
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,949
The new release of dual channel streaming with web

907
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:35,229
sockets, it allows us to have that low latency

908
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:35,789
connection.

909
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,640
After that, we provide the model choice

910
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,358
using the new Nova 2 models,

911
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,920
the freshly launched Gemini models, and the

912
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,078
latest cloud models.

913
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:46,029
After that we have memory.

914
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:47,049
This will handle

915
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,809
all the session management

916
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:50,348
and context for you,

917
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,789
so we have short term and long term memory to

918
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:55,019
store sessions for less than 30

919
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:57,108
days. So the conversation I just had would be in

920
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,009
short term memory

921
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,318
and then once you hit the 30 day window,

922
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:02,709
it gets uh summarized and stored

923
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,170
in long term memory to persist user

924
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:05,949
context.

925
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,160
And then within the AWS environment,

926
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:10,930
observability for your agent,

927
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,779
so knowing what the agent's doing,

928
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,439
seeing the token usage, latency,

929
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,180
that's where observability comes into play.

930
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,930
And then if you have existing functionality,

931
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,250
if you have lambda functions, existing code that you

932
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,608
wrote, or you have APIs

933
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:25,709
that you already have built,

934
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:26,989
agent core gateway

935
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,568
allows us to put an MCP layer on

936
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:30,630
top of those,

937
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:33,588
uh, APIs and lambda functions

938
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:36,088
and allow your agent to use that without having to rewrite

939
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,449
your code for agents.

940
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,959
And then we have messaging,

941
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,509
so let's take a look at a messaging

942
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,769
demo as well.

943
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:49,469
So just to recap, we had a voice

944
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:51,529
conversation that sent me this text message about

945
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,608
the age maker session.

946
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,618
This is great,

947
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,989
but I'm sitting in the session right now

948
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:57,608
and I can't take a voice call.

949
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,029
So I do have another question

950
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:02,578
that I want to ask the helper assistant.

951
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:05,289
So I follow up in this channel on how

952
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:07,559
do I get to the replay party. I heard the replay

953
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,610
party is at the fairgrounds. That

954
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,639
sounds really far away. My feet hurt from walking all

955
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,550
day between.

956
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,079
My hotel and the expo hall

957
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,559
and I don't wanna have to walk there

958
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:20,050
so I sent a text message, hey, how do I get to the replay

959
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,059
party from the Mandalay Bay.

960
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,409
I don't want to walk

961
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:24,298
And then

962
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:26,838
within a few seconds we get a text message response back

963
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:29,099
saying there's a complimentary shuttle

964
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:29,978
from

965
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,338
reinvent

966
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:34,358
the expo hall to the replay

967
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,518
party. And then I said great,

968
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:38,947
can you send me an email with this information?

969
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,197
So it'll send me a summary of

970
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,278
the session information

971
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:44,759
and it'll

972
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:47,849
tell me about how do I get to the replay

973
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:48,739
party from the Mandalay Bay.

974
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,110
So I finish up and fire off this text here.

975
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:54,409
And then

976
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,909
it lets me know that it sent me a text

977
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,059
message. Uh, sorry, excuse

978
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,329
me, that it sent me an email

979
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:01,760
in the same thread.

980
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:03,849
So here's the email. I'm opening up the email

981
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,228
as we see it texted me about the

982
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:08,010
stage maker session I was asking about

983
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:10,269
and the replay party and and how to

984
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:12,478
get there. So

985
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,949
that is the messaging

986
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:15,728
to email uh

987
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,059
seamless experience.

988
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,010
And now I pass this on to Dan to keep talking

989
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,030
about messaging. Awesome,

990
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,429
really cool. Thanks, Cameron.

991
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,478
Uh, so we just saw how you can easily

992
00:35:26,478 --> 00:35:28,559
switch from voice to

993
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,500
SMS,

994
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,929
uh, and continue the conversation

995
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,869
with the context, uh, preserved,

996
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,800
and I wanna just pause here on SMS

997
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,208
and messaging, uh, in, in general

998
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,449
because this is something that Twilio also does,

999
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,639
you know, really well,

1000
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,489
uh, but mess messaging is, is certainly

1001
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:47,659
complicated with compliance and

1002
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,659
global numbers and sender types.

1003
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:51,769
It, it is something that you really need a

1004
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:52,510
good partner.

1005
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,309
To make it more simple.

1006
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:55,969
Um,

1007
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,619
what type of sender do you have? What type of throughput do you need?

1008
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,789
These are things that are hard questions, uh,

1009
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,250
but Twilio certainly makes it, makes it easier.

1010
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,590
Uh, we're throwing up some stuff from Cyber Week

1011
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,030
last year. We have, do have our numbers blew

1012
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,139
from last week. They, we blew those numbers out, you

1013
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,269
know, we do have

1014
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,128
a massive scale,

1015
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:15,889
uh, and we can be the, the trusted provider,

1016
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,110
uh, in order to handle your, your messaging

1017
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,668
volume.

1018
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,610
Um, we talked about SMS, we talked

1019
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,409
about MMS,

1020
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,728
and those are cool. That's what's kind of people

1021
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,958
are used to using, but I

1022
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,010
would be remiss to not also talk

1023
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,168
about RCS, uh, and

1024
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:34,639
if you're in this space, you may know what RCS

1025
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,159
is,

1026
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:38,708
uh, but if you're not, it stands for Rich Communication Services.

1027
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,969
It's been in planning for a number of years

1028
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,969
now, like 10 years I think it's, it's, it's

1029
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,949
been in, in spec, maybe even longer than that.

1030
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,860
But it's finally gotten wings and

1031
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,869
Tweely was on boarding customers

1032
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:52,099
to RCS, you know, today and, and it is

1033
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,199
in production use,

1034
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,829
you know, what is it? What, what is it different? What's different

1035
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,938
about it? The first thing is gonna be,

1036
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:00,269
you know, the branding and verification. So

1037
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,510
in order to get a message, you know, from

1038
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,570
a business, you do get the actual

1039
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,590
logo and the brand and

1040
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,619
the verification. So a big deal as far as

1041
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:10,789
people knowing that they can trust the sender.

1042
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,809
Uh, the second one is

1043
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,849
about the rich content that

1044
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:19,469
becomes available in RCS

1045
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,849
and again pointing out RCS is available

1046
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,349
in your native application,

1047
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,969
so they don't need another application. This stuff is all

1048
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,628
delivered through the iOS

1049
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,128
or Android device as long as it has

1050
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:32,369
kind of the most up to-date operating system.

1051
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,110
Uh, but this type of interaction, so with,

1052
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,289
with content with, with video

1053
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,769
and rich carousels and cards,

1054
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,989
you make a, a huge difference

1055
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,688
from the user experience point of view.

1056
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:46,769
But, but not only that, there's, there's also called to actions,

1057
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:48,050
uh, so think,

1058
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,550
uh, quick reply buttons, uh,

1059
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,889
think, uh,

1060
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:54,269
carousels, think other widgets

1061
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:56,628
like wallet and calendar. These

1062
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:58,369
things all are now available

1063
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,949
with RCS and they're super cool, but think

1064
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,329
of that combining them.

1065
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,728
With, uh, agentic

1066
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,059
capabilities, so allowing your agent

1067
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,860
to, to send a quick reply button,

1068
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,579
allowing them to send a carousel or a calendar

1069
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:14,938
reply, there's a lot of neat things that are opening

1070
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:17,500
up and then again combine that with a voice

1071
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,599
conversation and switching to

1072
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:20,898
SMS and messaging and email.

1073
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:23,019
There's the, the possibilities, you know,

1074
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,199
with this new capability are really exciting

1075
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,739
and Twilio can help power them.

1076
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:29,679
I also want to point out that what

1077
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,829
everything I just said about RCS and what

1078
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,119
uh agents can do as far as sending rich

1079
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,599
content and interactive content

1080
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:36,938
is also possible

1081
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,500
with WhatsApp

1082
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,119
and many people from Reinventor from

1083
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,398
around the globe where WhatsApp is a

1084
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,639
primary channel. It is the preferred

1085
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,168
channel,

1086
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:48,800
and Twilio is a top provider of, of

1087
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,869
meta for for meta and WhatsApp, uh,

1088
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,119
globally. So just another channel that's, that's,

1089
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:55,300
that's available kind of as we were talking about voice.

1090
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,769
As different varieties where you might have

1091
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,769
SIP and Web RTC

1092
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,849
and the PSTN phone number, the same is

1093
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,110
true of messaging and you wanna be able to offer

1094
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,769
the messaging channel of choice. RCS

1095
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:09,309
where it's available, fall back to SMS.

1096
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:12,188
People prefer WhatsApp. You should have that available

1097
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:14,199
too. Uh, last

1098
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,478
thing too, while we're talking about WhatsApp

1099
00:39:16,478 --> 00:39:18,639
and going back to voice, we do have

1100
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,179
WhatsApp business calling

1101
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,878
available on the Twilio platform too, and that is

1102
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:23,780
being rolled out

1103
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,280
another exciting variety

1104
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,519
or version of voice so that you can also

1105
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,219
make available

1106
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:32,139
for your agentic uh applications.

1107
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,869
OK, so we've made it through,

1108
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,699
uh, two channels so far.

1109
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,010
Uh, so email is the last one,

1110
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,590
and email's been around for a while.

1111
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:45,750
Um,

1112
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,530
these are again our numbers

1113
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,228
from 2024.

1114
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,489
Uh, the 2025 numbers are, are bigger than

1115
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:53,010
this. You know, you know,

1116
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:54,019
Senrid

1117
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,570
Twilio Senrid powers tons of

1118
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,619
business emails, you know, every day and,

1119
00:39:58,728 --> 00:39:59,469
and certainly,

1120
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,090
uh, globally.

1121
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:02,469
Um, you know,

1122
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,030
email has been around for a while. My kids

1123
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,389
tell me that your email is, is, is

1124
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:09,668
kind of the old person's channel, but I actually

1125
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:10,849
don't believe that.

1126
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,688
Uh, I think email is something that everybody has.

1127
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,989
Uh, everybody is, it's ubiquitous.

1128
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,869
It's, it's, uh, something that.

1129
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,789
Allows for richer input and

1130
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:21,929
richer output

1131
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,800
and I think, and a lot of people share this belief

1132
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,199
it is primed to be a, a

1133
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,510
major channel and agentic applications

1134
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,668
as well you know I think voice is getting

1135
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:33,128
attention you see messaging.

1136
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,708
I think email is, is really

1137
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,750
one that that folks should look at and I think

1138
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,050
folks, you know, will look at.

1139
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,619
Um, so we, let's see a demo on,

1140
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:43,659
uh, email.

1141
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,898
Oh OK, throwing a little

1142
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:47,739
curveball at you.

1143
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,860
AI does some weird things.

1144
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,250
Uh, we, we thought we'd lighten it up a

1145
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,260
little bit. You may recognize that

1146
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,340
movie trailer or image from

1147
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,340
a popular movie, movie about three

1148
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,878
people,

1149
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,458
uh, that were in Vegas and, and got into

1150
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,438
a little trouble.

1151
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,179
Uh, so that is the theme of

1152
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,219
the last part of our demo that I'll

1153
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:08,938
pass over to Cameron.

1154
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:10,639
There you go, Cameron.

1155
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:11,739
All right, thanks, Dan.

1156
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:15,059
So let's see our 3rd email demo here.

1157
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,550
So I must

1158
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,590
have went just to recap, what do we see? So we had

1159
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,360
our voice conversation

1160
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:23,250
that sent us a text message.

1161
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:24,530
We had our text

1162
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:26,489
demo sending us an email,

1163
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:29,110
and now we're seeing email to email containing

1164
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,769
the same

1165
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,458
session history between the two.

1166
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:34,708
So let me click into this email from yesterday, so we're jumping into

1167
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:35,469
the future here.

1168
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:37,889
I must have been went way too hard at the

1169
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:40,208
replay party last night. I don't remember what happened.

1170
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,628
I don't even remember what sessions I went to yesterday

1171
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,369
and I lost my wallet. So let me follow

1172
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,599
up in this email thread that I got sent

1173
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,590
yesterday asking

1174
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:51,208
to help me retrace my steps and help me find my wallet.

1175
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:53,989
So I send that over

1176
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:55,250
to the email here.

1177
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:56,570
And

1178
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,829
it should

1179
00:41:58,269 --> 00:41:59,510
contain the session

1180
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:02,050
information from all the three channels.

1181
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,039
So we send this off

1182
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,619
and then with a few seconds we get an email response

1183
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,239
back with the

1184
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,639
summary of

1185
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:21,458
what we did.

1186
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:24,309
So we'll open this up here and we'll go through it.

1187
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,860
So it says earlier in the day I attended

1188
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,929
a Sagemaker session.

1189
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,579
Now that's starting to come back to me. I remember something on

1190
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,500
Stage Maker at the Mandalay Bay,

1191
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,679
and then it says I went to the replay party.

1192
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,449
OK, so how did I get there? It says I took

1193
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,590
the shuttle from Mandalay Bay. OK, great,

1194
00:42:40,128 --> 00:42:40,809
and then.

1195
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:44,378
Um, I enjoyed dodgeball, um.

1196
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:47,289
Maybe that's why my next little sore maybe I got hit in

1197
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:49,349
the head by a dodgeball or I had too much to drink,

1198
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,349
not really sure,

1199
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:53,139
um. So as you can see, it's retracing

1200
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:55,059
my steps to the 3 conversations I had.

1201
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:57,539
So when I asked about the replay party and I mentioned I was interested

1202
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,239
in dodgeball, it brings that up here.

1203
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,769
Uh, when I asked about the Mandalay Bay session,

1204
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,079
it brings that up here as well,

1205
00:43:03,378 --> 00:43:05,119
and then it recommends some steps on

1206
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:06,898
how I should follow up,

1207
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,228
uh, finding my wallet.

1208
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,320
So now we'll pass this back off to Dan. Awesome,

1209
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:14,269
thanks, Cameron.

1210
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,780
I, I'm sorry about the rough night you're

1211
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,559
gonna have tonight.

1212
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,398
Um, just kind of re-emphasizing

1213
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,909
what, what we've seen with these demos,

1214
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:25,188
made a, a, a voice call, you

1215
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:25,929
know, in,

1216
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,619
uh, was solved with the, with the agent.

1217
00:43:29,378 --> 00:43:31,500
Uh, all of the context of that call

1218
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,599
was preserved.

1219
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,958
Uh, then we moved to SMS,

1220
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:37,590
added more context, and requested more

1221
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,860
information, we got that back, and

1222
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,719
then thirdly we switched to email

1223
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,208
and asked a question, and, and the context from

1224
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,378
the entire conversation across all those

1225
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:47,789
channels was preserved.

1226
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,458
So it's a pretty neat stuff and, and this is something

1227
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,500
that we have built

1228
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,860
and we are gonna make available to you guys. This is

1229
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,800
the type of thing that you can build today.

1230
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,610
Uh, and we're certainly using, you know, the Twilio

1231
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,320
platform and tools available with AWS

1232
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,500
is going to allow you to do that

1233
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,679
to make it, make it easier.

1234
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,918
We saw this image before,

1235
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:09,378
uh, the users at the top, the Twilio

1236
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:11,659
channels, you know, of course conversation relays

1237
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:12,739
are supercharged

1238
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:15,059
version, uh, of that that's available

1239
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:16,010
for the voice channel,

1240
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:18,648
uh, the APIs that we saw, the

1241
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:20,929
application layer, the data context layer, uh,

1242
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:22,119
Cameron talked about.

1243
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,530
The frameworks that are available certainly make it

1244
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,659
easier to build out these agents. Uh,

1245
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,898
the bedrock services MCP

1246
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:30,978
is something that is, is

1247
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,659
in one of the slides that Cameron had too.

1248
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,829
And then lastly, you know, the models.

1249
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,329
So exciting stuff. This is the high level,

1250
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,530
and we did promise you another, uh,

1251
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:40,679
more complicated

1252
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:43,179
diagram, uh, that we can

1253
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,219
walk through and, and this is again what, what we

1254
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,340
have built and, and we are gonna make this

1255
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,429
available for you folks all to

1256
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:50,579
spin up too.

1257
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:53,199
And we'll spend a little bit of time and we're, we're, we're,

1258
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:55,500
uh, coming towards the end of it, but I'll let Cameron

1259
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,659
go first and, and talk about the AWF's

1260
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,179
side of, uh, this architecture,

1261
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:02,090
all right. So,

1262
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:05,208
We have these 3 channels from Twilio, where

1263
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,570
they're using web sockets and API requests.

1264
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,840
These all enter through Route 53 of our

1265
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,969
network. So the main, the first

1266
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:15,070
step is getting your domain set up

1267
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,309
and setting up your web socket connections,

1268
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:18,438
uh, certificates.

1269
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:20,929
We need secure connections to connect to

1270
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,449
programmable voice with conversation relay.

1271
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,969
You can't just use a normal web socket, it has to be secure.

1272
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:28,378
We drive all the traffic in through our internet gateway,

1273
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,148
so we have all of our networking with our low balancing

1274
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:32,510
between our two availability zones.

1275
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,090
So the key here is

1276
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:36,469
is co-locating your region closest

1277
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:37,409
to your customers

1278
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,869
to improve the latency.

1279
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:41,688
And then doing a minimum of 2 availability

1280
00:45:41,688 --> 00:45:44,188
zones within your VPC to

1281
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:46,349
reliably handle all the traffic.

1282
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,309
So we have our load balancing

1283
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,188
in our net gateway.

1284
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:52,409
Into our EC2 instances.

1285
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:55,010
So in this app, this demo you saw,

1286
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:57,429
we have EC2 instances within auto

1287
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:58,409
scaling groups

1288
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,869
that are running the server that uses the web

1289
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:03,070
socket connections to drive the dual

1290
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:03,590
channel

1291
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:06,030
streaming with conversation relay.

1292
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,309
And so conversation relay synthesizes

1293
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,469
the speech to text.

1294
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,840
The text gets passed into our AC2

1295
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,958
instance running our server that

1296
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:15,800
calls Bedrock.

1297
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:17,438
So Bedrock, uh,

1298
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,418
the EC2s are hosting the agents

1299
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:20,418
and then we.

1300
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:24,030
Called Converse stream for two-way streaming

1301
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,309
with Bedrock.

1302
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:28,320
Within Bedrock we're also using knowledge bases,

1303
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:30,389
so that's where the S3 bucket comes into play here.

1304
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:33,090
So in this design we have every

1305
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,090
single session as an individual JSON

1306
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,289
object that has the date,

1307
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:39,570
time, location, and general description

1308
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,510
of each session

1309
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:41,809
stored in S3 bucket.

1310
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,969
We use open search to vectorize that

1311
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,878
into our knowledge base hosted in Bedrock

1312
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:49,418
and then we have our converse stream conversation as

1313
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:51,800
I mentioned and then we have the knowledge base tool

1314
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:54,320
that's a asynchronous tool call

1315
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,418
using invoke Bedrock to run in the

1316
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:58,519
background because Converse stream does not

1317
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:00,878
natively support knowledge-based integration.

1318
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,458
So that's why we have a separately defined tool

1319
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,199
using the normal invoke Bedrock

1320
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:07,099
with the knowledge base ID

1321
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,099
to get more information about our sessions.

1322
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,579
And then for session persistence,

1323
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:13,929
we have Dynamo DB to store the

1324
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:15,309
sessions between users

1325
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:17,688
and the uh conversation

1326
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:19,708
history. And then as you

1327
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,869
saw where we had the web RTC with

1328
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:22,469
the demo.

1329
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,929
That was just hosted on Amplify with a simple react

1330
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:27,969
application using WebSockets to stream

1331
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:28,860
the audio to our

1332
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:30,909
Amplify application.

1333
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,639
And now Dan will talk about the Twitter side.

1334
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,539
Yeah, thanks, Cameron.

1335
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:37,090
Yeah, so

1336
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:40,239
On the Twilio side we have,

1337
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,599
uh, the things that we've covered here, but, but again

1338
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,639
kind of similar with leveraging all the, the

1339
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,719
platform capabilities of AWS

1340
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,500
you can do the same with Twilio and take advantage

1341
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,599
of our platform capabilities

1342
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,289
and security compliance dashboard.

1343
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:56,708
Brandon showed about some of the, the voice insights,

1344
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:58,800
what's available there, but that's available

1345
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,269
across all of your channels.

1346
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,599
Benefit of kind of consolidating on, on a

1347
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:05,019
platform. And the enterprise grade

1348
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:07,679
tools and kind of our super network capabilities

1349
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,820
that Twilio offers the global reach

1350
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,820
being kind of the most pertinent one or

1351
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,099
one of the most pertinent ones.

1352
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,438
Um, the channels we've covered all of these,

1353
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,958
uh, so programmable voice, we started

1354
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,079
there again pointing out the different varieties

1355
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:21,668
so you have

1356
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,719
good old fashioned telephone numbers, web RTC,

1357
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:25,590
you know, SIP,

1358
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:27,050
and, and WhatsApp.

1359
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:30,639
Uh, programmable messaging with SMS,

1360
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:32,860
we talked about, uh, WhatsApp. We've

1361
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,119
talked about RCS, and we talked about

1362
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:36,010
chat.

1363
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:38,699
All of these channels can be accessed

1364
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:40,898
through the same program, uh, programmable

1365
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:42,978
messaging API. So you're writing your

1366
00:48:42,978 --> 00:48:45,179
code in one way and leveraging

1367
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:47,559
all these channels. The same is certainly true

1368
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,478
with voice.

1369
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,619
And lastly with, with email, uh,

1370
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:52,418
also

1371
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:53,840
with our Serid product,

1372
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,599
straightforward all within the same Twilio platform.

1373
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,789
And I'm gonna point out to here

1374
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,289
the the post here from all three of these,

1375
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:03,728
so the interaction goes through a single endpoint.

1376
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,289
So just kind of stressing how cool we think this

1377
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:08,148
is, is you have all of the

1378
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:10,530
interactions that are coming from

1379
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,840
Twillo in order for, for inbound

1380
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,929
communications, whether that's an inbound call,

1381
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,329
an inbound message, an inbound email

1382
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,329
are going to the same endpoint through the

1383
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:20,059
same application

1384
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:22,889
and likewise that same application is

1385
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:24,128
is able to post back.

1386
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,978
Uh, of course, the voice

1387
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,829
agentic application is gonna use what's,

1388
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,989
uh, web sockets

1389
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:33,300
because that's required certainly for latency,

1390
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,800
but you have a simplified architecture, a

1391
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,119
more simplified architecture for a pretty

1392
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:40,199
complex application if you think about it. There's a

1393
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:41,219
ton going on here.

1394
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:43,958
But what the the the combined

1395
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,969
architecture platform capabilities of

1396
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:48,099
Twilio and AWS really

1397
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:49,079
takes a lot of that

1398
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,378
undifferentiated heavy lifting off

1399
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:53,898
of your hands and and puts it over to us

1400
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,719
allowing you all to to focus on the

1401
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:57,539
application part of that.

1402
00:49:58,389 --> 00:49:59,898
Uh, so we're excited about this again.

1403
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,398
It is a blog, uh, that is coming out

1404
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:04,300
so that hopefully you guys will, will, uh,

1405
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,519
look for that and, and spin it up on your own

1406
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:09,978
environments, and I'm gonna pass it to Brandon.

1407
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,820
Awesome. Thanks Dan. Thanks Cameron.

1408
00:50:12,938 --> 00:50:14,159
And so to bring us home,

1409
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:16,699
uh, presentation run 101, you,

1410
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,780
you tell them what you're gonna tell them. You tell them

1411
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,159
and you tell them what you told them.

1412
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,619
Uh, we talked about how, look,

1413
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,898
it's very hard to deliver communications

1414
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,500
at scale to deliver great customer experiences

1415
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,708
across all these different communications channels,

1416
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,168
um, and how Twilio and Amazon can

1417
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:32,719
come together

1418
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:33,760
to make that easier,

1419
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,599
uh, and us being together is better together. Um,

1420
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,699
to make this happen at scale, we started very

1421
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:40,969
simple, uh, at the beginning, and we got,

1422
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:43,340
uh, much more, uh, production scale in

1423
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,389
terms of the technicality of the, the architecture

1424
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:47,418
and like Dan mentioned, we have more coming so that you

1425
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:47,978
don't have to,

1426
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,500
you can take a picture, but we'll post a blog

1427
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,478
and you can go and build these things yourself.

1428
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:55,099
We also talked a lot about what we have

1429
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:57,179
today, what can we sell today? What can you go and

1430
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:57,820
buy today.

1431
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,418
Um, and if you wanna come and hear about

1432
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:02,458
what you can buy tomorrow and what the future

1433
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,559
might be, you can come and go across the bridge

1434
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,559
