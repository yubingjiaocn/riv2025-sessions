1
00:00:00,818 --> 00:00:03,180
All right, um, thank you very

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,360
much everyone for coming.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,219
Uh, today we're gonna talk about a topic that

4
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,159
was barely discussed this conference,

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:10,148
um,

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,528
and kind of under the headlines, uh,

7
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:13,538
we're gonna talk about AI.

8
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:15,579
Um,

9
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,539
but seriously now

10
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,420
I think

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,309
one of the areas where AI can make the biggest

12
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,359
impact is observability and, and, and

13
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:24,579
observability is

14
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,879
one of the closer areas to code where

15
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,420
AI is already making a huge impact in the world

16
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,739
and it's actually has the potential

17
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,560
to, uh, not just make our lives easier

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,560
as software engineers and platform engineers

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,340
but also

20
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:40,079
make our lives better with, uh, faster,

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,579
better software delivery, better

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,529
stability and security of software.

23
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,240
When we thought about it in CoreLogics,

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,060
we're trying to understand what is the highest value that we

25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,098
can provide. Is it an assistant? Is it a

26
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:51,889
co-pilot?

27
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,500
And we came up with Ali. This session

28
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,539
is going to be both about how we built it

29
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,179
and how we came to that conclusion

30
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,529
of what exactly is going to be the design,

31
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,060
but also a bit about how you guys can build it on

32
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,319
your own and what are the fundamentals

33
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,528
that you need to build, uh, uh, an AI

34
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:09,579
agent, not just for observability, by the

35
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,058
way, but for any data access.

36
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,620
I'll start with a bit of background about CoreLogics and

37
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,939
ourselves. Um, I'm the co-founder, CEO

38
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:17,698
of CoreLogix.

39
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,058
Laon heads AI for CoreLogics right

40
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,959
here. I'll be the one talking more about AI.

41
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:23,370
Um,

42
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,528
we started CoreLogics in 2015, launched

43
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,439
in 2017/300

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,448
petabytes of data ingested

45
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:33,790
every day in CoreLogic, probably a much bigger number.

46
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,638
We raised about $400 million

47
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,010
so far running, uh, multi-cloud,

48
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,290
but primarily Amazon. CoreLogic also

49
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,349
was awarded this year,

50
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,168
um, EMEA Partner of the Year for Amazon

51
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:45,829
Marketplace.

52
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,620
And uh we run on 8 different

53
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,159
regions today, including the federal cloud

54
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,698
on FedRAM moderate.

55
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,459
I don't have to say much. Software is

56
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,510
complex and it's getting more and more complex

57
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,939
actually this thing sometimes you need to use

58
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,028
something that you edited or something. This is

59
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:07,290
like a small company service

60
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:07,799
map.

61
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,629
Uh, when we look at large scale companies, services

62
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,629
got so complex today it's

63
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,729
almost impossible

64
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,349
for uh a platform engineer and, and

65
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,169
I think it also reflected in culture

66
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,669
of push things towards the engineering and the

67
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,868
service owners just because it's impossible to

68
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:25,110
understand and grasp, uh, software systems

69
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,250
today. If we go back in time

70
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,689
when we kind of started our engineering

71
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,288
experience, um, maybe 1517

72
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:33,669
years ago, not, not a, not

73
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:34,909
several decades ago,

74
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,689
there were monoliths. You would go to the machine, you'd look at

75
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,808
the logs, maybe a little bit of metrics, you get a good

76
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:40,929
understanding of what's happening

77
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,719
these days with microservices, different deployment

78
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,588
models, um, multi-cloud

79
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,778
serverless,

80
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,669
your ability to actually understand what's happening in your software

81
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,129
is very limited.

82
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,229
And we think we have the solution to that.

83
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,118
Uh, but we'll talk about it in a minute.

84
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:58,719
Telemetry is exploding,

85
00:02:59,038 --> 00:02:59,979
so people think,

86
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,439
OK, how do I monitor all

87
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,979
these microservices? How do I,

88
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,838
uh, get a better understanding of what's happening in my production

89
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:07,469
systems?

90
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,838
I'm just gonna add more telemetry. I'm gonna add

91
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,240
a metric. I'm gonna add a log. I'm gonna add

92
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,058
another instrumentation.

93
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,719
In just over 8 years we

94
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,788
see 100x,

95
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,618
um, this is from public sources,

96
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,229
100x increase in telemetry

97
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,618
data. What does it mean? It means that it's

98
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,689
complex, it means that it's expensive,

99
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,800
it means that it's difficult to manage,

100
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,469
but we're not really getting better observability, and we'll

101
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:33,179
talk about that.

102
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,429
The solution is the all in one dashboard.

103
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,159
One dashboard, it has

104
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:42,599
all that you need, all the KPIs that you're tracking.

105
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,699
I'm of course joking. The,

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,099
the last thing we need

107
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,479
is another dashboard. The last thing we need

108
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,419
is another alert.

109
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:51,788
The

110
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,278
world of just dashboarding everything and alerting

111
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:56,889
on every single possible scenario.

112
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,830
Uh, removes a bit of the ownership

113
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
from the service owners and the engineers towards

114
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
the services that they provide and run in production.

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,849
We think, OK, we solve the problem, we add a dashboard.

116
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
What's our definition of done for a feature? We have

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,580
dashboards and alerts set for it,

118
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,159
but the definition of done for a future is that we

119
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,480
can run it in production and keep it in high

120
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,939
quality and high performance.

121
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:20,709
So that

122
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,408
led us to build more dashboards

123
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,408
and alerts, and it, it feels like we got good

124
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,488
coverage. This is

125
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,127
an average of a CoreLogics customer. I'm talking

126
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,168
only the dashboards that are accessed and

127
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,709
alerts that are triggered

128
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,358
were in the hundreds.

129
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,968
Sometimes we come to customers that have 10,000 alerts,

130
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,348
20,000 alerts.

131
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:39,627
Can you really

132
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,509
comprehend the system? Do you really own

133
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:45,079
your service if it triggers 20 alerts

134
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,798
every day and has 100 dashboards on it?

135
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:47,908
Probably not.

136
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,319
This is what it'll look like.

137
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,379
You go into your dashboard interface. You got multiple

138
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,059
folders.

139
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,000
Many things are just, you know, duplicated

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,059
variables that you need to change to

141
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,160
understand your specific, uh, component.

142
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,238
Hundreds of alerts that are triggered, and then we built

143
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:06,769
on top of these alerts we built all these, uh,

144
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,869
alert aggregation tools and incident

145
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,000
management management tools. So we're trying to

146
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,000
figure out the problem, but we started with a very,

147
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:16,338
uh, kind of low state and we're trying to improve

148
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,540
it. There's

149
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,920
a paradigm now

150
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,540
where more dashboards, more

151
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,980
data, more alerts

152
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,420
don't mean more observability, don't

153
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,379
mean more reliability.

154
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,358
And intuitively you'd imagine.

155
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:35,579
Um, on data analytics in general,

156
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,850
you know, and, and a lot of us studied math or

157
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,088
statistics, the more data you have, the more accurate

158
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,290
you are. The more data points you get,

159
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,798
the better insights you get.

160
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,290
In reality, if you think about this for, for

161
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,829
observability and software,

162
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,449
what is easier? Is it easier debugging a service

163
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,678
with, uh, one service, 1 gigabyte of logs

164
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,269
every day, and 100 custom metrics,

165
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:55,189
or

166
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,970
billions of, uh, uh, metrics,

167
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,170
terabytes of data for multiple services?

168
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,309
Obviously it's easier when you have less.

169
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,129
So how do we

170
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,500
deal with that? Do we build more dashboards? Do we create

171
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,579
more alerts? Do we trim down data,

172
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,629
which is also a

173
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,949
complete industry that's started now just for filtering

174
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:13,548
data out?

175
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,790
We've got so much garbage we don't want to pay for it.

176
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,189
We start filtering out. We start optimizing.

177
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,139
And

178
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,278
The numbers I've given on dashboards and alerts,

179
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,790
those are only the ones that are being accessed.

180
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,350
92% of dashboards only

181
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,569
use, uh, are only used for one

182
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,608
week. People will create kind of

183
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:35,689
a standalone dashboard

184
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,790
for a specific issue they have, then they neglect,

185
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,899
neglect, neglect it. Now the funny

186
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,470
part is.

187
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,209
You know what's gonna happen in the next, uh,

188
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,319
postmortem.

189
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:46,858
The, the conclusions are we're gonna add this

190
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,389
dashboard now an alert,

191
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,139
so next time we'll know,

192
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,959
but you just go back and add the same

193
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,720
dashboard a week later, no one looks at it.

194
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,319
So

195
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,040
Engineers now have to spend

196
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,088
close to half their time

197
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,970
just triaging and understanding where should I even look,

198
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:06,350
what dash do I need to look at

199
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,048
out of 100 alerts, and every time there's a big incident

200
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,269
in large scale systems, and you know we run

201
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,548
one coincidentally.

202
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,088
Um,

203
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,019
when one service goes wrong,

204
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,649
everyone starts firing alerts and errors. So

205
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,838
where do I even start?

206
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,428
A lot of the times we start triaging and we think, oh, it's

207
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,548
that service. No, this is just downstream, this

208
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,588
is just the upstream.

209
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:28,428
So

210
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,009
can we do something better? Is there a way to

211
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,170
deal with this?

212
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,088
And also a big question is

213
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:35,869
how come this wasn't solved yet?

214
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,649
It's a big problem, and the data grows

215
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,230
faster than our ability to deal with it.

216
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,069
Now there's an opportunity

217
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,649
because something big happened in

218
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:46,869
technology over the past few years

219
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,910
and

220
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:49,629
how do we leverage that?

221
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,019
So let's start with the basics.

222
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,548
Observability is a term that we have a problem with,

223
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,189
uh, to be frank, and it's, it's a bit of a.

224
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:02,759
It's a bit tricky because we're an observability company,

225
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:03,838
um,

226
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,619
but observe is a very passive term.

227
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,579
Do I want to observe my systems?

228
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,579
I mean, imagine a.

229
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,608
Police officers will say

230
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,548
that their job is to observe the street.

231
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,319
We're, we're actually, you know, we need to keep systems up and

232
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,410
running. We don't need to observe them. Having more

233
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,108
monitors and dashboards

234
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,949
and telemetry is a great way to observe

235
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,629
what's the end goal.

236
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:30,209
The end goal is to have reliability,

237
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,528
to have stability,

238
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:34,009
to create business insights, to have

239
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:36,139
security. So

240
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,798
we keep building better observability,

241
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,359
but we kind of forgot

242
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,340
why we're building it and you know I can say about CoreLogics

243
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,119
specifically CoreLogics had invested

244
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,889
over $250 million in R&D

245
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,080
over the past 6 years.

246
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,139
So imagine the the amount of

247
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,239
engineering and R&D work that we put in

248
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,139
just to try to keep up with how fast

249
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,639
data and systems were evolving.

250
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:01,729
So we were in that arms race against

251
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,710
obviously a very crowded space.

252
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:04,979
But

253
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,418
it was very hard for us to go back to the

254
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,538
essence of what companies want, which

255
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,759
is reliability.

256
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:12,859
Ease of management,

257
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,840
being able to resolve issues faster, have

258
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,099
performance that's measurable.

259
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,070
Actually meet business KPIs that

260
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,729
drive

261
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,269
the revenue of the business and the customer satisfaction.

262
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,570
Now how do we get there?

263
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,899
Every software

264
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,058
emits

265
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,000
millions and trillions sometimes of data

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,590
points.

267
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,279
Core logics cover the entire suite, whether it's logs,

268
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,820
metrics, traces, infra monitoring, APM,

269
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,639
realism monitoring, SIM, AI monitoring.

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
So we, we're, we have enough signals.

271
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,580
We can get signals

272
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,239
for every, every, uh, user

273
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:48,859
action now.

274
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,389
But the challenge is

275
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:54,129
how do we stitch them together into a story and the

276
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,129
cardinality of data and the variety of data

277
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,668
and the multi-dimensional

278
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,408
aspect of it.

279
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:00,788
Create such

280
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,450
anthropy that to actually understand

281
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,029
what are the connections in a way that gives me high certainty

282
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,109
to take action is really complex.

283
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,369
And the compute that it required until now

284
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:14,428
was just impossible to employ to

285
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:16,408
solve that problem, and the data was growing so fast.

286
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,779
So that frog leap we've made in

287
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,479
technology now enables something else.

288
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:23,908
How do we now

289
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,869
create uh a story,

290
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,649
not we, we don't have an assistant to help

291
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,509
you build another dashboard or,

292
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,048
you know, a, a co-pilot that gives you

293
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:34,570
hints.

294
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:37,330
How do we autonomously and automatically

295
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,710
create that story from those bread crumbs?

296
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,759
To create a a complete new interface, a

297
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,879
complete new approach to observability, and go

298
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,219
back to the basics of

299
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,538
simple

300
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:50,000
and coherent insights that lead

301
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,840
to reliability,

302
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,639
performance, business KPIs.

303
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,779
And there comes

304
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,619
Ollie, and I'll hand it to LeBron.

305
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,558
Thank you, Ariel.

306
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,869
So as Ariel mentioned,

307
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,298
We've been focusing

308
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:07,139
on the wrong thing for the past few years,

309
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,080
right? We've been focusing about how we do better observability.

310
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,979
And we forgot why

311
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,479
we forgot that the key, the end

312
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,500
goal we are actually aiming for

313
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,450
is just to have reliable software.

314
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,190
We built something. We invested in developing the software.

315
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:23,139
We wanted our users to experience something.

316
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,580
And we built

317
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,019
crazy platforms just to observe them.

318
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,340
And yes, we have very, very advanced tools,

319
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:33,979
but how much do we increase reliability?

320
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,058
How much have we increased reliability with all these

321
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:36,918
capabilities?

322
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
And this new paradigm of AI,

323
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,779
right, like I think you can see it here on every

324
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,759
single booth,

325
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:43,879
on every vendor,

326
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,048
right. There

327
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,168
is a true and great power

328
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,178
to it. Which allows us

329
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,288
really to rethink

330
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,739
what is observability or

331
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:57,428
you know really reliability. How do we achieve

332
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,570
it and how can we actually do it

333
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,408
not the same way, not grow linearly,

334
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,109
but actually how can we do it 10 times better than

335
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,168
what we've done until now.

336
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,500
And this is where Ollie comes into the picture,

337
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,649
the world's first autonomous observability

338
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,830
agent. So

339
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,908
what all is doing, how it, how it

340
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,109
actually works, right?

341
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,729
So we talked about billions and trillions

342
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,190
of bread crumbs, logs, mattress,

343
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,509
uh, metrics, traces,

344
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,639
um, let's say.

345
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,479
I'm at home watching Netflix, watching Squid

346
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,570
Games. I click on

347
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,509
episode number 2.

348
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,808
And it doesn't work, right, or it glitches

349
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,548
for a few seconds, right? Quite annoying.

350
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,288
Not a fun evening to have.

351
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,119
But why it happens, so it means there's probably

352
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,399
something along the way, along the software stack,

353
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,690
right, maybe some microservice backend,

354
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,019
maybe a database

355
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,918
experiencing some issues, maybe actually another third

356
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:52,658
party application

357
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,340
that my app, the Netflix app is connected

358
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,090
through API

359
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:58,320
having some experiencing some issues.

360
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:01,029
And all these pieces

361
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,609
somehow result in me as

362
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,690
a user experiencing not even a

363
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,229
downtime, just a glitch

364
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,599
or unexpected behavior that

365
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,928
the original engineers actually wanted

366
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:12,668
a name for.

367
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,489
So this, all these pieces,

368
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,428
taking each and every

369
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,928
component, the microservices, the databases,

370
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:20,960
the lambda functions,

371
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,469
taking the bread crumbs of each one of them.

372
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,599
Potentially should tell a story of what happened

373
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,009
to Iran as a user,

374
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,509
right? And the question is not

375
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,710
only what happened to me personally as a user,

376
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,908
but what actually happens as a trend

377
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:35,469
for

378
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,509
more users.

379
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:38,869
Maybe there are hundreds or thousands of users experiencing

380
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:39,639
the same issue,

381
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,969
and what's common about all of them.

382
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,678
So Back to what we

383
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:46,389
see on the screen,

384
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,779
we see all these

385
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,590
billions of breadcrumbs,

386
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,580
right? And usually how do we do it?

387
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,340
We open the alerts,

388
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,340
try to find correlated alerts,

389
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,950
we deep dive into the dashboards, we

390
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,960
filter out for logs, say, hey, I see

391
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,969
there's some error logs,

392
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,668
right? And then I understand, oh, I see like these

393
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,190
services seems to be related,

394
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,710
right? So I further analyze.

395
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,119
So we have logs, we have, uh sorry, we have alerts, we

396
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:09,918
have dashboards.

397
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:11,798
And the third component

398
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,259
is plenty, plenty of manual

399
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:14,840
labor

400
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,239
going into

401
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,639
resolving, investigating

402
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,000
production incidents,

403
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,500
OK? So we've all, we have

404
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
all this information available not only for

405
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,599
us but also for Ollie,

406
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,119
and the beauty of it.

407
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,129
is that it makes everything go away.

408
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,779
No, OK

409
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,440
So Ollie takes all this information

410
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,149
we can give them the task.

411
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,788
And then it zooms in

412
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,678
onto out of all these billions of breadcrumbs

413
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,428
onto the specific most relevant pieces

414
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,769
to the task at hand.

415
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,729
And the next thing, it actually eliminates

416
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:53,609
the noise, right?

417
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,928
Remember, we have more and more and more and

418
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,308
more. We lost clarity. We got more noise.

419
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,168
On eliminates all this noise.

420
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,250
And can actually focus on the signals

421
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,369
that truly are important and

422
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:05,989
hopefully.

423
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,639
will tell my story as a user.

424
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,210
And most importantly, it can connect the dots

425
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,489
to one single story,

426
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,489
what the end user is experiencing

427
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,908
or the end users are experiencing,

428
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,408
all the way back

429
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,509
to what was the root cause of that.

430
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:24,418
Sounds too good to be true.

431
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,908
Yes, no.

432
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,158
OK. So, uh, yeah, these

433
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:30,058
are nice slides,

434
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,658
but I think uh the proof is in the pudding, so

435
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,479
let's see all the in the works.

436
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:38,509
So,

437
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,440
what I'm going to do now, you can see my screen, right?

438
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:42,190
Awesome.

439
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,649
So, nice to meet you. I'm Adam. I'm

440
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,389
head of platform

441
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,678
at um Spotify,

442
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,340
a sport goods companies.

443
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:52,190
And I manage the e-commerce website

444
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:55,000
and the platform team, and I'm just writing code in

445
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,710
the meantime.

446
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:58,739
Doing my day to day tasks.

447
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:02,808
And as I'm doing my work,

448
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,599
Let's see.

449
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,190
Oh, I got a message.

450
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,629
I got a message from Sarah Parks. Let's see.

451
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,200
So Sarah is our VP of product.

452
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:22,158
She's very good at what she's doing,

453
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,320
and

454
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,239
let me zoom in a bit.

455
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,200
Um, I got a message.

456
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Adam, this doesn't look good. What's going

457
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,700
on? We're getting slammed with customers'

458
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,759
complaints. Um, and it seems like she

459
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,219
referred here to an alert we got on

460
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,239
production alert channel.

461
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,729
So let's take a deeper look into it.

462
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,440
So we can see a warning about checkout error spike.

463
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,558
So we're an e-commerce website.

464
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,798
Obviously the last part is

465
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:49,178
customers come in after they've chosen, they chose

466
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,320
the items they can check out

467
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,808
and make the purchase,

468
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:53,558
and it seems like there is an issue,

469
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,149
so. Instead of opening

470
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,320
another dashboard, let me just ask Ollie,

471
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,099
hey, Ollie,

472
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,099
um, can you please

473
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,440
take a look?

474
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,289
OK, and as I tagged Ollie,

475
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,680
Ollie immediately reacted, as you can see,

476
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,180
and it starts conducting an

477
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,150
investigation of what really happened,

478
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:14,750
and he shared with me

479
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,130
um this link so I can see

480
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,509
really what's going on

481
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,739
in real-time. Let me zoom in a bit.

482
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:23,939
OK. So

483
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,519
how will it work? What we are actually seeing all it works

484
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,939
like yet another engineer in

485
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:29,469
your team.

486
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:32,348
So think about yourself, right? You would have

487
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:34,390
looked on dashboard every time, let's say

488
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,969
we would have filtered for

489
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,250
error logs.

490
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:40,140
We would have identified some pattern, actually,

491
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,410
uh, let me zoom out,

492
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:45,380
um. We

493
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
would identify a pattern. Based on that, we

494
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,739
would probably see another filter or go to traces

495
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,858
or go to metrics. So in every given

496
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,598
point in time I have one thing on my screen.

497
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,818
So on the right side,

498
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
what you can see is what Ollie is currently

499
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,039
looking at.

500
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,838
So for example, right now we can see Ollie is looking

501
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:02,578
at the logs.

502
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,348
OK, and it's, it's, it's writing

503
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:07,420
to, it's writing to me, it's sharing with us

504
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,338
what it currently thinks

505
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,500
and what path it is exploring.

506
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,660
Um, and it has many capabilities whether it's exploring

507
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,930
logs, metrics, traces,

508
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,199
correlating them,

509
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:21,000
analyzing the code.

510
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:23,029
And more

511
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:26,358
OK, and we see that we got a result, so

512
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,078
let's see what happens.

513
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,930
So let me close this.

514
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:34,180
And by the way, as you can see, this is a live demo.

515
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,618
Decided not to go for a video.

516
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,539
Um, OK, so let's see.

517
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,279
I noticed a spike in failed checkouts

518
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,459
over the last 2 hours.

519
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,519
Dug into shopping cart API. This is

520
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,539
one of our services,

521
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,588
logs and found a new type error that correlates

522
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,680
exactly with the spike. It is affecting about

523
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,858
2000 users.

524
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:56,019
From here we can see what is the root cause.

525
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,818
Failed checkouts

526
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:00,118
are caused by type error exceptions in the

527
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:01,338
shopping cart API service.

528
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,949
Now one more thing you will see with OI

529
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,500
is that every time OE provides

530
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,699
you with information,

531
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,838
it backs it up with evidence.

532
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,479
Why? Because we know AI can hallucinate, can make up things,

533
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,739
and we want to make sure we can actually trust

534
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,519
OI. This is a key

535
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,140
that we put a lot, a lot of effort and

536
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,259
engineering resources into ensuring

537
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,150
the quality of OLI.

538
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,338
So I can see exactly the logs that

539
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:29,000
are relevant. Let me open one of them.

540
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,759
Uh, and we can see the message here is unsupported

541
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,729
operan type

542
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,019
and the trace back. This is a pipe service,

543
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,019
so I can see really what's going on.

544
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,868
Um, let's go on.

545
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:40,608
So where it crashes.

546
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,358
So Ali here actually opens the code file,

547
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,509
analyzed it,

548
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:48,039
and found the specific lines of

549
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,019
code causing the issue.

550
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,199
It explains that some function fails

551
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:55,140
because it tries to add in.

552
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,750
And none raising this error.

553
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,539
Why

554
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,979
have we gotten to this case from the get-go

555
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:03,000
that we have none

556
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,269
in this,

557
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,779
in this list of items in Python?

558
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,818
The reason is bug and removed from card lines

559
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,059
65 to 66. I can open the source

560
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,279
file and actually I also got

561
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,420
suggested fix from Ali.

562
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,170
So it seems

563
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,328
You know, not like

564
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
really quite an easy fix we hopefully

565
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,509
can apply.

566
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,078
um, also an analysis of how many

567
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:27,199
users were impacted and chart

568
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,229
analyzing where the issue has started,

569
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,269
how it looks like,

570
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,380
and so on.

571
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,029
Um, Ollie also share with you what happened,

572
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,229
so. Just to understand how

573
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:38,229
all it really got to this thing, it's not

574
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:38,809
magic.

575
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,469
There was a real in-depth

576
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,549
investigation that happened in this one

577
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,709
minute. So all the analyzed

578
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:46,299
metrics.

579
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,390
It tried to find relevant metrics.

580
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,118
It looked specific payment errors, API

581
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,390
errors, checkout error account.

582
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,880
Rain query. I won't go into each one of them,

583
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,568
but you can see just

584
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,449
this, let's say we have one.

585
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,910
234.

586
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:06,949
4 queries

587
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,009
Just think about how long would it take you just

588
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,088
to realize you need to write this

589
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,269
query and filter this out and make sure the syntax

590
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:14,779
is correct.

591
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,049
Realize what's the insights you're getting from it and

592
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,170
how you can actually continue with the investigation.

593
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:22,430
Um, usually, usually

594
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,529
from what we see in our customers, this time being

595
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,588
saved is about 94%

596
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,868
on average,

597
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,709
um, and to make it into numbers, that means

598
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,068
an issue

599
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,828
that would take me 5 hours to investigate

600
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,130
with all it would take about 20 minutes.

601
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:39,469
OK, Obviously

602
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,189
this is average. There are things that.

603
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,160
Finish up in a matter of 2 minutes.

604
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,098
Some of them take longer than that,

605
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,799
um, but all in all, this is extremely powerful.

606
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,019
OK, so now we have

607
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,949
we've identified the issue. Let me go back because

608
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,699
I don't want Sarah to be upset with me.

609
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,279
Um, so Nikesh, our engineering lead,

610
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,598
hey Nikesh.

611
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:01,588
We have a production issue.

612
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,799
Please take a look

613
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
on the reason.

614
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,279
And deploy a fix

615
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,380
ACP. please

616
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,660
keep me posted.

617
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,318
And I'll be sharing. Let me go to Ollie.

618
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,618
Let me share this link.

619
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,969
Awesome. And lastly, Sarah,

620
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,049
we don't want to leave her waiting.

621
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,699
Sarah

622
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,338
Thanks for bringing.

623
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:31,598
This up,

624
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:33,199
we're on it

625
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:34,578
in the fix.

626
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,219
Is on the way

627
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:38,868
I think it deserves some

628
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:40,170
applause.

629
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:46,719
This is real, OK? Like this is real.

630
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,799
I have

631
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,699
a video demo here in case the internet would,

632
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,799
you know, make up some challenges, but

633
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,279
what you just saw,

634
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:57,059
the querying, the data, the use case,

635
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,039
all of this

636
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,559
is from a real environment,

637
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:01,858
OK? No, no, not a simulation or anything

638
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,729
like that. So

639
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:06,059
What we've just

640
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:08,039
What we just saw

641
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:11,029
This is not better observability. This is

642
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,150
how we can actually achieve 10

643
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,509
times better reliability than what we had

644
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,170
until now.

645
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,789
OK? Oli understands your stack. This

646
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:20,449
is super important.

647
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,868
The reason Ollie was able to do

648
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:25,868
that in a matter of a minute and come

649
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,989
up with valuable insights and not just made

650
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,750
up ones.

651
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,420
It's because like similar to any engineer you

652
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,239
would hire that would go through training,

653
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,979
when you connect and integrate OLIF

654
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,078
for the very first time,

655
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,719
it learns your observability workspace.

656
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:42,689
It learns what, which applications you have, what

657
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,640
subsystems,

658
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,140
uh, what are, what fields are present in the

659
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,809
logs,

660
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,000
metrics.

661
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:51,318
Has it occurred to you that you have 5 metrics,

662
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,818
one with capital case, one with lowercase, they all

663
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:54,559
mean the same thing.

664
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,549
But they have different naming, so when you query, you

665
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,598
may miss some of them, right, because you

666
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:00,858
just didn't know

667
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,670
that the casing is so important.

668
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,939
So OLI is familiar with all these fields,

669
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,559
and this is extremely powerful. This is what allows Ollie

670
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,789
really to conduct smart and insightful

671
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,618
investigations. So

672
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,660
In a matter of minutes we found the root cause.

673
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:16,930
We got a suggestion for a fix.

674
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,769
I think this example is particularly

675
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:22,838
interesting. Because

676
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,739
the fix here was not.

677
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,719
I don't know, increase CPU or anything like that

678
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,059
or allocate more pods.

679
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:32,140
This actually was a code

680
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,400
issue. And think about

681
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:35,479
an on-call,

682
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,539
any on-call, any SRE,

683
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,559
any developer. It doesn't matter

684
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,529
how much, how much experts

685
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:44,588
they are. With

686
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:45,130
this,

687
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,868
they could have gotten to the root cause within the lines

688
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:48,568
of the code,

689
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,348
even if they're not familiar and they haven't seen this

690
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,489
code repository before.

691
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,189
OK, so this is really the true power we're

692
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,049
talking about,

693
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,789
and I think most importantly,

694
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,170
I didn't open even one dashboard.

695
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:02,009
I didn't filter

696
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,930
any query on my own.

697
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,118
And this is really the true power and the true

698
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:10,900
potential we have here to achieve 10 times better availability.

699
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,799
Now for those of you here in the crowd and I

700
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,539
see you and some skeptical guys here

701
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,160
thinking, oh yeah, it's just chat GPT

702
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,259
for observability. It's, you know, I saw that.

703
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,380
It's not

704
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,539
OK.

705
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,019
And let me elaborate

706
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,880
what OL is not. So it's not chat GPT for observability

707
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,130
in the sense that OL is not just

708
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,098
chat GPT-like interface

709
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:33,559
for accessing your observability data. It's

710
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,118
not that.

711
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:36,380
All it has context,

712
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,039
all he has knowledge, all is autonomous,

713
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,959
meaning in every single, it doesn't have playbooks

714
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:43,660
in every single point of time.

715
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,029
It decides autonomously

716
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,469
what is the next step.

717
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,618
Ollie is also.

718
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,640
Not an AI assistant.

719
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,900
I'm sure you saw plenty. Every

720
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,949
single company on Earth these days.

721
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:03,078
Got directive from the CEO we need to add AI

722
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,009
as much as possible, right?

723
00:26:05,588 --> 00:26:07,828
So we see that with AI assistant,

724
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,219
this small cute chatbot you

725
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:11,900
see on the bottom right usually,

726
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:14,150
right, like, hey, let me help you.

727
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:17,118
And these are great, like they do provide a lot of

728
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,289
value, but the value they focus on is

729
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:20,949
really making you and making

730
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,390
your users

731
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:23,789
more efficient

732
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,029
within the platform,

733
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:27,910
right? So if Oli, for example, was an assistant,

734
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,939
It wouldn't do the investigation for you or

735
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:31,529
with you.

736
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,689
It would actually just help you build

737
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,549
dashboard in core logics.

738
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,229
Um, so it doesn't do that. It's not an AI

739
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,380
assistant. The power, the difference in power

740
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,130
is

741
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,529
not becoming,

742
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,509
I don't know, 20% faster in building dashboards

743
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,328
or alerts.

744
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:48,910
It's actually becoming 10 times better in reliability,

745
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:51,328
which is a much broader, higher level

746
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,549
goal for the organization.

747
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,348
Um, and lastly, MCP.

748
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,500
MCP has been around for

749
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,809
quite a while now.

750
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,568
Um, So

751
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:05,189
Oli is not a server. We do offer for

752
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:06,068
CoreLogics.

753
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,130
OK, but all is not that. What are the differences?

754
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,289
in a way

755
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:13,890
is exposing API.

756
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,098
For AI agents, OK. So if I want

757
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:19,019
to take my, my information,

758
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,890
for example, for, to expose CoreLogics

759
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,239
information to other AI agents like cursor,

760
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:25,358
I would take

761
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,549
The CoreLogix MCP server,

762
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,959
but it does not have any knowledge. It does

763
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,739
not have any spatial context.

764
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,779
Um, it, it is not

765
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,660
an AI agentic AI system.

766
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,410
So let's understand what OLI is and how OI

767
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,479
works. So

768
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,900
it all starts

769
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:44,900
with data.

770
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,299
For years

771
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,299
we've been

772
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,318
really focused on how we achieve, store

773
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:50,858
better data.

774
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,479
And finally, I think really over

775
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,699
a decade that we're

776
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:57,160
talking about data and the potential value of data, I think

777
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,400
finally we can harness the true value

778
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,519
and the true potential of data.

779
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,160
So CoreLogix is really

780
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,380
good as a platform

781
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,699
for processing, harnessing

782
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:10,680
tons, massive amounts of data, petabytes

783
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,979
of data, terabytes of data.

784
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:13,059
That we've

785
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:15,459
really close to infinite retention.

786
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:19,910
So all of this is being leveraged by Ollie.

787
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:22,729
All he learns from this data,

788
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,689
creating a knowledge base,

789
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:27,328
like he would learn something in school, for example.

790
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:30,130
And then with this knowledge,

791
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,068
What you saw and saying that you

792
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,729
may say, hey, this is an AI, an

793
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:36,309
observability agent.

794
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,949
It is not an observability agent because agent

795
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:39,890
is singular.

796
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:42,039
Behind the scenes,

797
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,519
Ollie has a team of agents,

798
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,439
specialized agents working for you.

799
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:49,269
OK, so we have, for example, Logs Explorer.

800
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:50,989
We have metrics Analyzer.

801
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:53,489
Each one of them is powered by SLMs.

802
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,689
SLMs are small language models.

803
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:58,549
Think about 7 billion parameters, 13

804
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:59,608
billion parameters

805
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:02,588
that is specialized in the specific

806
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:04,229
role and specific task at hand,

807
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,289
and they all collaborate together

808
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:09,229
to produce insights, answers.

809
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:12,019
Which altogether allow us to get this

810
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,959
10 times better reliability we were talking about.

811
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,930
Now, let's go a step, uh, a step back and talk

812
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,189
in general about any agentic AI

813
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:21,489
system. I think this is,

814
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,348
if you wanna know how you, what

815
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:25,650
you can take back home

816
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,209
to your offices, to your work, and

817
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,449
how do you build

818
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,868
your AI agent or your own only.

819
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,868
This is all about that.

820
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,209
So any agentic AI system has 5

821
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,338
main components.

822
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,049
Obviously we can break it down to more, but these are the

823
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,269
core concepts and the core things you

824
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,269
must have in agentic AI system.

825
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:47,630
So it starts with a model in the center.

826
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,559
OK. Um, which is

827
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,848
clear, this is like the engine

828
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,989
for our agent or our agenttic

829
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:55,500
system.

830
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,318
We have the system prompt. So for example, you're

831
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:00,500
an expert in analyzing logs

832
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:01,818
for this company.

833
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:04,578
So this is how we provide actual instructions

834
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:05,219
to our agent.

835
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,939
Then we talked about multiple agents, so we said

836
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,219
logs explorer, right, metrics analyzer,

837
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:14,160
let's say security

838
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,838
analysts, and so on.

839
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:18,160
The way they collaborate together.

840
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:21,140
Could could be different

841
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,818
and it is crucial. So for example,

842
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,920
um, there are different design patterns for it. One architecture

843
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,618
would be that I have one orchestrator

844
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,838
that takes the task. For example,

845
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,910
in this case we ask for investigation.

846
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,358
So the orchestrator is familiar with

847
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:36,420
all the other agents.

848
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,420
And assign tasks.

849
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:39,670
Hey Log Explorer,

850
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,078
please find me relevant logs to this issue.

851
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,880
Log Explorer will come back with results.

852
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,789
orchestrator will decide on next steps.

853
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,709
This is one type.

854
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:51,420
Another type is

855
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,588
handovers.

856
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,670
We can decide, we can

857
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:57,430
make any sub agent autonomous

858
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,390
so they can play around together as a team.

859
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,519
Like playing ball and at every given

860
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,559
point in time someone else holds the

861
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,598
ball, meaning they are the one leading

862
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,019
the conversation from now on.

863
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:10,400
So there are different architectures about how

864
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
we actually organize our agents.

865
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,779
Then we have the knowledge.

866
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,189
Which talks about

867
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,219
how we provide this, how we empower this

868
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,459
agenttic AI system

869
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,189
not only with tools

870
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,759
but also the knowledge, the information that's

871
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,809
very, very much needed to make smart decisions

872
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:30,709
and smart actions.

873
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:32,618
And lastly, but

874
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,269
probably the most important one is the evolve. How do we

875
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,699
actually evaluate the quality

876
00:31:37,118 --> 00:31:38,318
of our agentic system?

877
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:40,009
So

878
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,969
out of these 5.

879
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,549
What you will notice is model

880
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,868
is commodity.

881
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:47,660
OK, so,

882
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,328
um. Opus was

883
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,189
released, I think 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago.

884
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,689
We have access to it. All of you have access to

885
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,848
it. GPT 5 got released,

886
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:57,750
same thing.

887
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,199
So there's nothing really unique about the model. We can,

888
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,328
we all share the same models and same

889
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:04,368
for system prompt. I can write something, you can write something.

890
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,108
It won't be, it won't make a huge,

891
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,430
huge difference.

892
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,368
So that leaves us with 3 other

893
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:11,328
main components.

894
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:14,380
Which together compose what we call the

895
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,239
context engineering triangle.

896
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,759
The context engineering triangle,

897
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,239
this is the key. What you see here, these 3

898
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,059
components.

899
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,259
If you want to build a powerful,

900
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,880
high quality agent.

901
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,699
You need these 3 items and

902
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,358
you need to understand them deeply.

903
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,130
And focus on them.

904
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,789
So we covered about agent architecture and the importance

905
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,009
of agent architecture.

906
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:41,390
I want to talk a little bit about

907
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:42,848
knowledge and memory.

908
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:46,269
So in Chat GPT I think we are all familiar

909
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,088
with the fact that

910
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,469
as we talk with Chat GPT sometimes it

911
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,420
memorizes

912
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:53,250
what we talked with him about it, right? And

913
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,019
then it can be reused in other conversations.

914
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:58,338
But one of the challenges

915
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,489
With making the eugenticI system really, really

916
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:04,890
good. With

917
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,969
knowledge as well

918
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,529
is the limitation of context,

919
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,529
right? In theory,

920
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,150
if I could take all my petabytes of

921
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,259
observability data from the last week

922
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:17,769
and just push it to all of them and wish them good luck,

923
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,789
I would do that.

924
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,598
But it's not technically possible

925
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:22,660
as for today.

926
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:25,529
And I think we can also take here that more is not

927
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,539
more here as well, the fact that it

928
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,838
will have more data.

929
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,868
It does not mean I will get better answers.

930
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,180
So what we do need, we need to

931
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,759
have.

932
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:37,989
Relevant data,

933
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:40,848
we have, we need to have it in a structured

934
00:33:40,848 --> 00:33:43,108
way that is optimized for the LLM.

935
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:45,588
And let me tell you that,

936
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:46,989
it may sound that

937
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,209
changing models is quite easy, right?

938
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,449
Just within the API call, change the string,

939
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:52,729
AGPT5.

940
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:54,380
Now, I want to use cloud,

941
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:57,059
very easy. In

942
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,000
reality, changing model is difficult.

943
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,358
Um, the reason it's difficult because

944
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,939
different models have different preferences and you

945
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:05,939
need to optimize the context you're building

946
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:06,489
accordingly.

947
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,119
So the knowledge needs to be optimized as well.

948
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,679
So going back to we want to build this observability

949
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,789
agent. We need to push

950
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,280
relevant information

951
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,409
to the context,

952
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:18,648
and we already

953
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,389
agreed we cannot just take all the logs, metrics,

954
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,208
traces, and so on from the last week.

955
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,688
So we need really the way to do

956
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,228
it.

957
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:28,867
Is actually

958
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:31,568
the same way as we investigate and as we conduct

959
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:32,148
an investigation.

960
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,409
Is identify the key parts and

961
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,500
the key elements.

962
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,010
Store them at first.

963
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,829
In the structure, it could be uh whether in vector

964
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:44,639
DB, knowledge graph,

965
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:47,429
or just rational DB depending on what

966
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,199
information we store.

967
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:51,409
And allow our agent to access this

968
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:53,559
information and the querying part is also key

969
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,849
here because the fact that I have this

970
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:57,119
information stored somewhere

971
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:58,958
does not mean

972
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,378
I know how to query it in a, in an

973
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:02,079
effective way.

974
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:04,539
So we said, how do we, how do I store

975
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,789
this information? How do I structure it,

976
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:09,300
and how do I query? These are the three components

977
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,519
when it comes to knowledge

978
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,878
and of how we build

979
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:13,860
this context.

980
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,128
So let's say we've done these two really, really good. So

981
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:18,000
we have model,

982
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,719
we have system prompt,

983
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:22,500
we have some agents architecture, we can do something simple

984
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,269
for starters.

985
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,519
Um, And let's say I saved

986
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,139
some basic aggregations

987
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,760
on my logs

988
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,260
to, to start simple.

989
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,329
The last

990
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:36,478
Thing which is actually the most important one

991
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:38,840
is evils. Els is short for evaluation.

992
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:41,878
Now, in traditional software, we have unit

993
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:44,010
testing, integration testing, system testing,

994
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,349
right? When we build it, we test,

995
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,550
we see, hey, thumbs up, nothing broke,

996
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,969
all good, we can go live.

997
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,958
A new future comes in.

998
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,878
We implemented.

999
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,860
We build some new tests, run it

1000
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,079
again, it all works well.

1001
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,449
Ideally we would have done the same

1002
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:05,489
with with AI agents.

1003
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:06,719
The challenge though.

1004
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:08,878
is that there is no structure.

1005
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:09,989
What are we testing?

1006
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,800
Right, like we have a conversation, the user

1007
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,219
can input whatever they want.

1008
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,599
The possibilities are infinite.

1009
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,628
Right, like, what do I test?

1010
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:22,369
What happens if the user just come in and

1011
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:24,688
say, Hey, um,

1012
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,449
what should I order for lunch?

1013
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,199
There are infinite amounts of possibilities

1014
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,579
to what the user would put in.

1015
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,938
So the question of how do I evaluate it

1016
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,539
becomes really, really challenging,

1017
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:38,820
um, and if

1018
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,280
not done correctly, or if you actually build an AI agent

1019
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,378
and you don't evaluate it at all,

1020
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,119
I can show from experience what happens

1021
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:47,000
is.

1022
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,570
You build something,

1023
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:49,929
it seems to be working,

1024
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:51,320
right? Even you,

1025
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,708
let's say you're very proud, you deploy it to production, you

1026
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,590
say to your friends, hey,

1027
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,610
I have it, you can start using it

1028
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,188
in a matter of minutes, probably you will get some

1029
00:36:59,188 --> 00:37:00,648
slack message or someone will tell you,

1030
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:03,208
hey, hey, look, I tried this, it doesn't work.

1031
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,260
So, oh, no problem, I'm on it.

1032
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:06,489
You'll go back,

1033
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:08,860
you'll check this very, very specific use case,

1034
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:11,030
and you'll change the system prompt, and guess

1035
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,030
what, you will be successful in.

1036
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:15,119
Resolving this use case,

1037
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:17,469
so it seems like we made progress,

1038
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,269
but what you didn't realize

1039
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:21,688
is as you change the system prompt, you change

1040
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:23,110
the entire behavior of the agent.

1041
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,079
Two things that used to work before

1042
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,000
the test that you ran a day ago.

1043
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,349
This use case

1044
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,708
is not working anymore.

1045
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,300
OK.

1046
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,500
So

1047
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,360
this is why evaluations in AI

1048
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,539
agents are no less than crucial.

1049
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,260
I will say just one more thing about Evals.

1050
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:49,179
Another challenge here is not only

1051
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,570
Testing because it's not just one message.

1052
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,978
I got input, output, is it correct or not?

1053
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:57,188
We have an entire flow of conversations.

1054
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,840
So how do we test this?

1055
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,429
Um, so I, I'll leave it as a food for thought and we can

1056
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:03,688
talk this offline if, if some of you are interested.

1057
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,179
Um, so how does that translate into Oli?

1058
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:10,119
So the beautiful thing you saw before, this is

1059
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,619
what happens behind the scenes.

1060
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:12,898
Onto the left,

1061
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,769
OK, and this is really sharing with you the internals,

1062
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,599
how all it works under the hood.

1063
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:19,889
On the left,

1064
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:22,269
OLI is powered by CoreLogic's extremely

1065
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:24,289
powerful observability data platform.

1066
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,570
OK. So

1067
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:27,829
notice. Remember I told you OLI

1068
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:28,949
is not an AI system.

1069
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,199
That's exactly that.

1070
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,559
O is not an expert in

1071
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,559
using core logics or using its features to build

1072
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,199
dashboards.

1073
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:39,300
It is an expert in helping

1074
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
you with achieving better reliability and

1075
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,250
investigating issues,

1076
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:44,519
optimizing production, and so on.

1077
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,599
So it leverages the large scale data

1078
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,139
observability platform by CoreLogics.

1079
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,438
From it, it takes all these signals

1080
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,800
and creates knowledge.

1081
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:58,719
To be honest, like if you were to ask me to choose one

1082
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,349
thing or the key

1083
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,289
to all these success and quality lies, it's

1084
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:03,869
within the knowledge.

1085
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:07,208
And then we have the collaboration of

1086
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,378
the multiple agents. Again, each one

1087
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:10,809
powered by small language model,

1088
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:12,398
which allows us to

1089
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:14,820
get really invaluable production insight as we

1090
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,820
saw. So how can you take

1091
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,938
it back home and how can you start to build your

1092
00:39:18,938 --> 00:39:19,579
own ollie?

1093
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,179
So, first thing first,

1094
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,739
beta. We need to

1095
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,978
store all of our data somewhere blogs, metrics,

1096
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,159
traces. The more we have, the better.

1097
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:32,208
Um, but we also need to make sure

1098
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:32,829
that we

1099
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,349
build in a structured way that

1100
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,769
the agent can actually optimize in that.

1101
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:40,668
The second part is what we call semantic layer.

1102
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,829
OK, semantic layer is.

1103
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,019
Really, uh, more, uh,

1104
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,449
we call it the basic understanding at least of the data.

1105
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,688
Let's say I have a field that has the name

1106
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,849
CPUSG

1107
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,000
70.

1108
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:55,909
What does that mean?

1109
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,769
So maybe we can assume it means CPU

1110
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,289
usage over the last 7 days

1111
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,438
or CPU usage over the last 7 days,

1112
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,179
but it's it's important for the agent,

1113
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:06,780
for the, for our engine.

1114
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,929
To have this information.

1115
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,889
Because this is what allowed the agent

1116
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:13,349
to make smart decisions, say, hey,

1117
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:15,889
I have a problem with CPU. This metric

1118
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,340
is actually the metric that would

1119
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,489
is likely to be relevant, so maybe I should check this out.

1120
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:22,429
OK, so semantic layer

1121
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,329
is, I would call it kind of the first building

1122
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,469
block within the knowledge

1123
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,128
of the agent.

1124
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,360
And the third part is building your first AI

1125
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,510
agent MVP.

1126
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,280
Take whatever model.

1127
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,840
Build it.

1128
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,679
They are actually great tools. It's OpenAI

1129
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,320
agents at Python SDK,

1130
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,418
Linkchain, and others.

1131
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:46,958
Today it became quite easy to come up

1132
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,079
with an MVP, so I do recommend really

1133
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,760
just getting your hands on.

1134
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:53,789
And try to build this thing.

1135
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,869
So and this is just the core

1136
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:57,898
concept to start with.

1137
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:00,239
So from here

1138
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:02,840
We've seen one

1139
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,820
Demonstration of how Oli works.

1140
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:08,340
Um, Oli has been in beta for

1141
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,809
the last few months with with some of Corologic's

1142
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:11,438
customers.

1143
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,478
I do want to share with you

1144
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,438
how it actually works, how it actually looks,

1145
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,019
um, in real life. So this is a story of one

1146
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,119
of our customers.

1147
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:22,878
I was actually fascinated to hear that, to be honest.

1148
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:26,489
So they had a notification

1149
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:27,070
service,

1150
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:29,938
OK. It's a microservice run on, uh,

1151
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:30,829
running on Docker.

1152
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,389
That had random latency spikes.

1153
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:37,050
Every now and then, it was really unclear

1154
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,949
what's going on.

1155
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:40,409
They look on the logs, they look on the metrics, they

1156
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:42,530
look on the traces, they try to analyze them.

1157
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:46,119
But they couldn't find any correlation

1158
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:47,958
to these latency spikes.

1159
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,800
They're really puzzled of

1160
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,000
what's going on,

1161
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,519
and at some point they say, you know what,

1162
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,159
we have no idea.

1163
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,699
So let's, let's leave it this

1164
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,739
way. Um, after trying out only

1165
00:41:58,739 --> 00:41:59,789
for a few weeks,

1166
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:02,179
they say, you know what, let, let's give it a try. We

1167
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,398
have nothing to lose, right?

1168
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,639
So what happened?

1169
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,648
OK. So the first thing they,

1170
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,500
that Oli helped them realize is

1171
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,458
this notification service

1172
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:18,579
is actually connected to another email service

1173
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,918
that's connected to authentication service that's

1174
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:21,878
using RDS.

1175
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:25,429
Now that's interesting because until that point

1176
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:26,369
in time,

1177
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:28,809
they didn't even think or consider

1178
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:30,489
checking for RDS.

1179
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,369
Because the service itself has nothing related to

1180
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:34,030
RDS.

1181
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:35,750
OK, so they were looking

1182
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:37,550
in the wrong places.

1183
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,719
Now not only that it is connected to RDS,

1184
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,139
the reason it is interesting,

1185
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:45,099
um, as identified, all the correlated

1186
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,099
spike, spikes in

1187
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,949
the CPU,

1188
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,719
CPU spikes of the RDS,

1189
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,260
amount of connections,

1190
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,760
as well as latency spikes of the RDS,

1191
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:57,639
and this was correlated with the spikes of the notification

1192
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,148
service.

1193
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,739
So for the very first time after 4 months,

1194
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,898
they got some clue of.

1195
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,389
We have at least more understanding of what's

1196
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,599
going on. No, the

1197
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,679
investigation didn't stop there. It was not a one shot. It

1198
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,039
was not just one prompter. It was 4

1199
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:13,780
or 5

1200
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,769
messages in the conversation.

1201
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:19,128
So the next thing that Oli shared with them.

1202
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,079
It has found another lambda

1203
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,159
function. That

1204
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:26,179
also works with this RDS function,

1205
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,559
uh sorry, with this RDS database.

1206
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,550
And the interesting thing is that

1207
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:34,789
This lambda database apparently

1208
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:35,708
this lambda function.

1209
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:39,239
Apparently has also correlation

1210
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,349
when it activates

1211
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,199
with the spikes of the progress.

1212
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,418
OK.

1213
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:47,309
Um, And looking when

1214
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:49,329
Oli looked on the queries that were running

1215
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,409
by this lambda function.

1216
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,500
It realizes this, that the queries

1217
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,869
were running against unindex tables,

1218
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,909
right, which obviously makes, uh,

1219
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:00,340
it creates loads on the RDS

1220
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,659
and as a result identification service.

1221
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,199
So from here the, the fix was quite obvious. Um,

1222
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:07,349
Oli Ollie also recommended it, but I think it was

1223
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:08,039
quite clear

1224
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,000
that the, the fix is really just building indexes

1225
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:12,119
for these tables,

1226
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:15,139
um, but this is fascinating.

1227
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,878
Like think about how much time.

1228
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:19,280
would take to find and

1229
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:21,820
investigate and get to the root cause of something like

1230
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,889
that. Right, we have

1231
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,590
3 services, 1 lambda function, each

1232
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,869
one running and managed, being managed by a different

1233
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:31,030
team. RDS they didn't even

1234
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,110
think about it as something that could be

1235
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:33,648
related,

1236
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:34,889
um, and in general,

1237
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:37,309
something tricky about lambda functions, right? They

1238
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,489
start, they end,

1239
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,809
nothing happened,

1240
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:41,809
like they never existed.

1241
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:42,929
Um, so

1242
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:44,458
this is a real case,

1243
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,789
super interesting. 4 months, this,

1244
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,289
this issue was unsolved.

1245
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:50,728
Tripoli, less than 10 minutes,

1246
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,510
they realized what's going on.

1247
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,648
So we talked about the power

1248
00:44:57,648 --> 00:44:59,550
of reliability. We talked about

1249
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,260
the fact that our focus was in the

1250
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,000
wrong place.

1251
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:05,398
We're running after observability.

1252
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:06,840
We forgot

1253
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,719
to chase after reliability.

1254
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:11,418
So how do we move from here? OK,

1255
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,438
we're still in the early days of AI.

1256
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:16,489
And what you see, so in

1257
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,829
the last decade, I would say observability

1258
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:19,949
has

1259
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,389
increased and has

1260
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:25,349
Kind of evolved in a linear way.

1261
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,938
We've added more features. We've had user sessions,

1262
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,128
RAM, more capabilities, obviously and more features,

1263
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,000
so we have improved but not

1264
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,159
exponentially.

1265
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:36,039
This is the first step what I'm just presenting you.

1266
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:37,760
This is just the first step

1267
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,378
in the paradigm shift we're experiencing.

1268
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,800
The first milestone is co-pilot.

1269
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,559
So just to clarify, it's not here to replace

1270
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,829
anyone. It's here to help us make our work,

1271
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,579
make our job much, much better,

1272
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,139
and to allow us to focus on what really matters.

1273
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:55,289
The next step

1274
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:56,489
for Ollie.

1275
00:45:57,398 --> 00:45:58,619
And, and by the way, it's like

1276
00:45:58,878 --> 00:46:00,599
a few weeks from uh

1277
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,398
getting the first release of it.

1278
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,898
It's being proactive.

1279
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:07,228
What does that mean? It means two things. One,

1280
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:10,128
it means when an alert fires on Slack,

1281
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,728
only automatically triage and

1282
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,550
provide you with

1283
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,688
initial understanding of what's going on.

1284
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:19,030
The second part of being proactive.

1285
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:22,280
Is really allowing OE to

1286
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,340
take actions,

1287
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:25,139
all right. Maybe it's

1288
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:26,679
just pull request,

1289
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,329
maybe it's just changing our

1290
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,679
AWS environment.

1291
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,500
So this is the next step. This is the proactive phase

1292
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:36,119
and the holy or holy grail.

1293
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,619
Is getting to preventive observability.

1294
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,769
OK, now think about it. This is

1295
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:44,269
An ideal.

1296
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:47,168
Think about an agent, and I think we've been talking about

1297
00:46:47,168 --> 00:46:48,668
this vision for years now,

1298
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:51,668
but for the very first time it seems possible

1299
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,909
to get to a point where we have an agent

1300
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,648
that constantly watches our production,

1301
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,168
whether it's from a product standpoint, whether it's from

1302
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,168
a cost standpoint,

1303
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:03,250
operations, infrastructure, and so

1304
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,409
on and so forth. It is familiar

1305
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,458
with the way it works in general. It is familiar

1306
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,550
with seasonality

1307
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:10,050
and it can say, hey, listen.

1308
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,938
We expect to see an increase in loading in

1309
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:13,958
the next few days.

1310
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,219
We have 80% utilization.

1311
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,648
We have to increase the amount of pods and take action

1312
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:20,429
and actually increase this amount of pods,

1313
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:21,878
preventing

1314
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:24,289
a downtime or delay for users.

1315
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,619
So this is really where we're going with that.

1316
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,148
And with that, I'm really happy to share that

1317
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,239
OLLI is now generally

1318
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:35,119
available for all of CoreLogic's customers.

1319
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,519
Um, we started rolling this out and by December

1320
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,599
15th, will be publicly available for all of

1321
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,300
our users.

1322
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,099
So

1323
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:50,320
I think we covered a lot of points,

1324
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:53,269
um. Whether

1325
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:55,550
it's the fact that the software stack

1326
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,449
has changed.

1327
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:58,889
Um, I really remember, you know,

1328
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:00,449
10 years ago

1329
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:03,289
when you build an app, it was just one single

1330
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,728
application. It was a web application.

1331
00:48:05,188 --> 00:48:06,688
You were running it on one

1332
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,869
web server.

1333
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,719
And that's it. And maybe you had some blogs

1334
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:11,429
written somewhere

1335
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:12,849
to help you debug it,

1336
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:15,188
so it was much, much, much easier, much

1337
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:17,929
convenient. But now we have microservices

1338
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:19,969
and we have server loss and we have so many text

1339
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:21,719
tech and so many moving parts,

1340
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,070
all of them creating

1341
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,489
so many breadcrumbs.

1342
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:27,780
So we have to find a better way

1343
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,059
to achieve software reliability.

1344
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:32,659
This is not a feature

1345
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,409
All the autonomous observability. This is

1346
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:37,829
not the future. It's not

1347
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,188
just something cool.

1348
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:41,168
It's really a paradigm shift.

1349
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:43,648
It's really a change of the way

1350
00:48:43,648 --> 00:48:45,809
we think, the way we work, the way we act,

1351
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,628
and the time is now.

1352
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,590
It is not something futuristic. What you saw is

1353
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,378
already working.

1354
00:48:51,688 --> 00:48:52,429
Proactive

1355
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:53,550
is really,

1356
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,188
let's say 2 or 3 months away,

1357
00:48:57,289 --> 00:48:59,449
so the time to adopt this solution,

1358
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,639
the time to implement those solutions is really

1359
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,938
now. We have this opportunity

1360
00:49:03,938 --> 00:49:06,019
to make our software much, much better, to

1361
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:07,079
make our work better.

1362
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:11,090
And with that, I want, I wanna thank you. I'm

1363
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,228
happy to take questions

1364
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,449
afterwards. I'm not sure if we have time.

1365
00:49:14,878 --> 00:49:16,789
Uh, yeah, just, uh, we, we got like

1366
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,289
a few minutes for questions if anyone wants. Um,

1367
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:19,889
we're very happy.
