1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,500
- [Chris] Alright, I
got anyone's attention.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,333
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,620
Welcome to our session,

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,050
our Code Talk on agent code generation

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,713
for industrial analytics
and predictive maintenance.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,250
So, I don't know if you've
attended our workshop,

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,720
we actually had one as well.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,049
Sea of hands if anyone attended
a workshop we did as well,

9
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,299
as well as our fan club.

10
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,170
It's good. (laughing)

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,090
So it's actually a little
continuation from that.

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,230
So just special for you.

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,003
You'll get to see what we do here.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,300
Alright, so my name, I'm Chris
Azer, I'm a principal gen AI

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,373
labs solutions architect.

16
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:40,440
So I'm part of a team where
I'm a tech lead helping

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,130
to drive industry applications
with generative AI

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,830
and just showing how we
can improve, you know,

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,695
operations and other types of use cases.

20
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:51,750
And so I've been with AWS eight years

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,600
and doing industrial
automation for 20 years.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,902
So happy to share this progress

23
00:00:57,902 --> 00:00:59,730
and where we're at today, right,

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,250
where this next form of transformation

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,200
and manufacturing really can accelerate

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,870
and create agility in being able

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,450
to drive operational improvements.

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,800
And so I'm joined with Raju.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,080
- [Raju] Yeah, thanks Chris. Hi everyone.

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,440
I'm Raju Gottumukkala and I'm

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,880
an IoT specialist solutions architect,

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,880
and my focus has been really
working with industrial

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,450
and manufacturing organizations
in terms of, you know,

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,513
helping out throughout

35
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,200
their digital transformation
journeys, right,

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,208
starting from how do you unleash
data from machines using,

37
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,410
you know, hundreds of
industrial protocols all the way

38
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,168
to building intelligent models,
you know, that can respond

39
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,763
when there are issues with those machines.

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,100
Yeah, over to you Chris.

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,910
- [Chris] Alright, so for
our agenda, we're gonna kind

42
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,910
of just talk about some common
challenges in this space by,

43
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,550
if you're from the industrial world,

44
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,319
you may be familiar with those already.

45
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,200
We'll then jump into our AWS stack

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,150
and just show you what we're
gonna use today, right,

47
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,350
which AI services, which
IoT services will be used.

48
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,050
And then gonna go through
a couple of tutorial,

49
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,730
you know, coding sessions.

50
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,150
Again, this will be code
that you'll have access to

51
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,623
at the end.

52
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:14,670
So there'll be a QR
code, you can get access

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,947
to our code on GitHub.

54
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,680
So the first one will be around, you know,

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,130
looking at anomalies and creating
a repair plan around this.

56
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,560
And then we'll look at it
kind of going deeper, right,

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,780
and using advanced analytics

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,048
that can actually look at maybe
excessive anomaly detections

59
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:34,680
you do have, and really trying
to look at a bigger picture

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,830
through analytics of
what could be an issue

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,633
or relation between maybe
multiple parameters.

62
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,467
All right, so some
common challenges, right?

63
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,830
You know, when we look
at, on the left here,

64
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,833
IoT and OT, I'm sure
people heard this acronym,

65
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,400
we're trying to merge these
two different worlds together,

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,860
operational technology and information,

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,025
and they just, they operate different.

68
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:04,050
They have different processes
and different software

69
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,120
and different environments.

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,020
So there's a lot of challenges
in this space, whether it's,

71
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,590
you know, lack of response times,

72
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,810
slow digital transformations
because it takes

73
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,060
a certain skill set to implement some

74
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,160
of these latest transformations,
like technology,

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,160
whether it's IoT or you
know, AI or digital twins.

76
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,430
There's also this data
analysis gap, a skills gap

77
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,750
that would exist for being able

78
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,910
to create these predictive models.

79
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,930
And with generative AI today.

80
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,600
we've really gotten that ability
to give that to the power

81
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,710
of many people, right?

82
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,800
Being able to do this
kind of complex analysis

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,763
on time series data and
really try to find anomalies

84
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:46,681
or patterns that may exist.

85
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,440
So that kind of skills
gap doesn't exist in both

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,083
of these orgs, you know,
readily available, right?

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,370
So this gonna lead to costly
downtimes, just accepting

88
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,850
that there's a downtime that
happens with this just machine

89
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,630
or this vendor's machine,

90
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,280
and I'll have to do scheduled
maintenance more often.

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,810
There's also a manufacturing skills gap.

92
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,390
There's an aging workforce,
you know, there's people

93
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,730
that are just not there 30 years anymore

94
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,710
and that kind of loyalty, right?

95
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,480
They're leaving with that knowledge.

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,460
So how do you enable that
new workforce to be able

97
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,170
to make quicker decisions

98
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,090
and really minimize that response time,

99
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,373
the meantime to respond to a failure?

100
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,100
Other common technical challenges.

101
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,213
Service complexity.

102
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm not saying our services are complex,

103
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,770
but just in general
there's a lot of services

104
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,470
that may exist, a lot of
different technologies

105
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,620
and being able to optimize
the use of those services

106
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,070
in a way that would be able
to solve that problem quickly.

107
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,230
So being able to have that learning curve

108
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,150
to understand the services
that I need to use,

109
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,750
the SDKs I need to use
can really slow down

110
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,223
that advancement and agility.

111
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,310
- [Raju] Yeah, so we talked
about the challenges.

112
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,990
Let me start with one of
the common challenges I see

113
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,880
with my customers, right,

114
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,900
is when you're in a manufacturing
facility, you got to deal

115
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,500
with different systems,
different control systems,

116
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,040
OT systems, IT from
different vendors, right?

117
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,830
So the data is siloed in most cases.

118
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,060
So the real challenge is
how do you unleash data

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,710
from heterogeneous systems

120
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,513
and then how do you create those contexts

121
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:36,763
so you can then build
analytics on top of it?

122
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:41,880
And then you need a reliable
data foundation layer

123
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
before you can actually go ahead

124
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,660
and create agentic AI workflows.

125
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,980
So before we talk AI, let's
talk the data foundation

126
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,867
that you need to build the AI layer.

127
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:57,867
So when I talk about data
foundation layer you need a way

128
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,700
to collect data from machines,
be it, you know, Modbus,

129
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,410
OPCUA, MQTT, or any other
industrial protocol.

130
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,930
You need to collect the
data, model the data,

131
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,879
model the machine, store
the data securely depending

132
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,440
on your price latency trade-off, right,

133
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,273
for your use case.

134
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:20,460
It could be a real time
operations dashboard

135
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,570
type of use case,

136
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,000
or it could be some post factor analysis

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,833
that you do every quarter.

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,940
And then once you store the data securely,

139
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,580
then you need a way to egress the data

140
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,930
from that foundation layer, right,

141
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,640
to run your analytics.

142
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,600
Now this is where AWS IoT
SiteWise comes into play.

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,530
It's really a purpose built
industrial data service

144
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,843
for industrial and
manufacturing use cases.

145
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,830
Essentially it helps you with
the end-to-end value chain

146
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,210
for industrial data,

147
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,293
starting from collecting
data from machines at age

148
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:57,690
to buffering data at age
to intelligently publishing

149
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,640
to cloud cost efficiently,

150
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,050
and then storing data in the cloud

151
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,710
and then making it available
for the AI layer, right?

152
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,130
So one unified platform
that gives you access

153
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,510
to all the telemetry and
the knowledge base data.

154
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,855
So we'll use this SiteWise
in our tutorials today

155
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:19,980
and then show how you can
build that foundation layer

156
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,260
before we build AI agents.

157
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,590
So with that, let's talk
about AI, what we got to offer

158
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,999
and on top of this data foundation layer.

159
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,698
Over to you, Chris.

160
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,531
- [Chris] Yeah.

161
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:33,180
So before we get into that,
any questions you may have,

162
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,320
this is open.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,153
Open questions.

164
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,050
- [Raju] Yeah, these interactive,
so you can ask questions,

165
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,043
not like workshop.

166
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,453
Any questions on-

167
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,470
- [Chris] Okay, there you go. Yep.

168
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,400
- [Attendee] So I would say probably one

169
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,233
of the biggest things

170
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,000
that I noticed with inside
the IoT space is like kafka

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,203
is like nonexistent from
like a transport protocol.

172
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,540
Is that like inside the stack

173
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,870
or do you guys see that like more

174
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,610
and more than Kafka is like
taking over the OTT space

175
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,734
or that transport protocol as-

176
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,430
- [Chris] Do you see that,
you're saying that you're seeing

177
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,100
that more than, use of Kafka more than-

178
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,450
- [Attendee] Well, I'm
actually seeing like less-

179
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,410
- [Chris] Less of it uses.

180
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,700
- [Attendee] It's like not dipping

181
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,565
into the IoT space as much.

182
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:11,850
- [Chris] Okay.

183
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,683
Yeah, no-

184
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:13,650
- [Attendee] Do you
see it differently like

185
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,153
with your guys' lens in the industry?

186
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,800
- [Chris] That's a good question.

187
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,950
- [Raju] Yeah. So depends
on the machine, right?

188
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,660
So, and also the throughput.

189
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,570
So MQTT is a good fit, you
know, when you're dealing

190
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,510
with resource constrained devices

191
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,703
that transmit messages frequently,

192
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,650
but not too big in terms
of the message files,

193
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,998
that's a classic scenario
for entity-based messages.

194
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:39,723
- [Attendee] Mine would be
like post device (indistinct).

195
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:46,230
- [Raju] So yeah, that's a good question

196
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,910
because in fact we are
working on a few enhancements,

197
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,539
it's still under design.

198
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,159
But the idea here is SiteWise
has all the contextualization

199
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,727
done in it right.

200
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:00,030
Now you need a way

201
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,020
to extract the data.

202
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,880
Today we provide different ways

203
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,535
to do it using HDK, MCP,

204
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,600
but then one common ask
is, can we extract data

205
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,570
in a data stream format, right, to Kafka?

206
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,027
So today you could do
it through a middleware,

207
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:17,700
through IoT core.

208
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,243
SiteWise can emit mqtt
messages to IoT core,

209
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:23,550
and IoT core has a rules
engine that can route messages

210
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,580
to 20 other services, including Kafka.

211
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,620
So you can do it today,

212
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,770
but we are working on some
enhancements to make SiteWise

213
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,710
to Kafka data egress much more efficient.

214
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,260
But there is a way today for
sure that's available for-

215
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,657
- [Attendee] You don't see as
many people doing it, I guess.

216
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:43,830
- [Raju] No, we do see customers,
you know, asking for it.

217
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,410
We build, we work
backwards from the customer

218
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,510
because we had customers asking for it,

219
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,880
you know, we are building
some more enhancements.

220
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,783
So the quick answer is, yeah,

221
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:54,789
it's a very common
pattern we see nowadays.

222
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,592
How do I extract data, the contextual data

223
00:09:57,592 --> 00:10:01,559
to your streaming layer
and we are providing

224
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,880
some more tools for you to do that.

225
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,503
- [Chris] Good question.
Any other questions?

226
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,923
We'll ask you again later.

227
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:15,600
So, okay, so jumping into the AI stack,

228
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,460
you know, this is probably
out of date just after,

229
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,960
you know, yesterday, right?

230
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,553
But we we're just constantly
developing the stack

231
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,520
and the way you look at it,
it starts from the bottom

232
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,140
where we have our infrastructure, right?

233
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,230
So we talk about AI compute,
whether that's, you know,

234
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,980
silicone, like AWS Trainium and
other types of (indistinct),

235
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,887
and other types of GPUs.

236
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:37,830
We have Amazon SageMaker
for that fine tuning

237
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,341
and that, you know, data
scientist layer, right,

238
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,443
in terms of that kind of
work you would be doing.

239
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,180
We're not gonna be
focusing on that, right?

240
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,909
We're actually in the middle layer, right,

241
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,270
and in the top layer.

242
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,680
So in the middle is
where you actually build

243
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,320
and use services,
configure and use services,

244
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,140
that runs on top of this infrastructure.

245
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,850
So you're not necessarily
saying, I'm gonna use

246
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,370
that chip set, I'm going to,
I want to use this chip set.

247
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,440
We actually abstract that for you

248
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,490
and you just use the service or software.

249
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:10,230
So there's Amazon Bedrock, which is a,

250
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,580
essentially this platform

251
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,490
that handles many different
capabilities starting

252
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,800
with your choice of
models you want to access.

253
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,773
And in this case we're
gonna use Claude Sonnet 4.

254
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,760
That's one of the LLMS you
can access through Bedrock.

255
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,620
There's other capabilities like guardrails

256
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,040
and you know, other things you
can do, which we won't use.

257
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,398
We're gonna use the knowledge base

258
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,580
to actually access vendor manuals

259
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,003
and specifications that would
be used by the agents later.

260
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,370
And then there's AgentCore, right?

261
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,590
That's where you have a variety

262
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,679
of models you can choose
to pick and choose to use.

263
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,480
You can decide to use Runtime

264
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,400
and run your agents there.

265
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,260
You can use a gateway to access tools.

266
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,610
So there's a variety of
just different modules.

267
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,140
And so what we're gonna do is
actually have a Strands agent

268
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,240
on the top, top right.

269
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,620
That's a open source framework

270
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,370
we have to build agentic applications,

271
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,823
and we're gonna be able to
use memory from AgentCore

272
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:08,340
so we can contain that
memory in a conversation

273
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,825
that someone like a process engineer

274
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:11,723
may need to have access to.

275
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
On the top, we're gonna
have an application layer

276
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,850
using Kiro.

277
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,990
Anyone, you have heard of Kiro,

278
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,823
I'm sure about this point, right?

279
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,860
This is our a developer
environment we have

280
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,900
and now recently announced
an autonomous agent

281
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,813
that can run off the IDE in the cloud.

282
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,590
And so we're gonna see that
combination of services used.

283
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,060
Ultimately we're gonna help you walk

284
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,400
through building this application

285
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,909
and then executing some of the code and,

286
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,958
and walking through the
code that we would use

287
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,603
to perform these different tutorials.

288
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,893
Alright, so we'll start the
first one. Okay, over to you.

289
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,040
We have to switch over.

290
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,970
- [Raju] Yeah.

291
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,873
Any questions before we
move on to a live tutorial?

292
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,360
And how many of you use
Strands SDK today in your day

293
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,790
to day or weekly or monthly?

294
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,800
Anyone, Strands? Anyone new to Strands or?

295
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,554
- [Chris] Or some use building agents.

296
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,124
Agents? No?

297
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,410
- [Raju] So not many.

298
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,063
- [Chris] Yeah, she's like maybe. Yeah.

299
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:15,390
- [Raju] Just wanna make
sure so we know, you know,

300
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,760
how much time we wanna spend on Strands

301
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,580
because yeah, this session
is not about Strands,

302
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,400
but more on, you know, how you use Strands

303
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,793
and AgentCore for a
specific domain use case.

304
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,530
So yeah, I'll try to cover
some basics when I do that.

305
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,950
Okay, so in the first
tutorial, so we'll split,

306
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,170
we have two tutorials total,

307
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,140
so probably we'll spend like
20 minutes on each tutorial.

308
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,344
And yeah, if you have any
questions, please do ask.

309
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,330
So in the first tutorial,
so we'll show you

310
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,330
how you can create a workflow,
agentic workflow that

311
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,710
it's made up of three agents

312
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,130
and each with a specialty,
we'll go into the details,

313
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,000
but then the workflow, the goal here is

314
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:05,940
to create an autonomous
maintenance response

315
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,640
or a repair plan when
there is an issue going on

316
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,440
with the machine, right?

317
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,750
So the prerequisite for
this tutorial, again,

318
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,740
it's all in the GitHub repo,
we'll share that in a moment,

319
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,050
is to have the environment ready, right?

320
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,840
So environment, when I say is SiteWise

321
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,893
with your assets onboarded to SiteWise,

322
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:26,280
data stored in SiteWise,

323
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,900
and to those new to SiteWise,
we came up with a new

324
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,930
anomaly detection module
of SiteWise natively.

325
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,480
So you can enable anomaly
detection on a machine

326
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,850
without ML expertise.

327
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,000
So we do use that as an
input for this workflow.

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,490
So the prerequisite is to
prepare your SiteWise environment

329
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,130
with all your data and
anomaly detection enabled

330
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,480
at least for one asset.

331
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,430
So you have the anomaly result coming out

332
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,889
of that asset, right, the anomaly score,

333
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,830
or some model explainability, right?

334
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,240
So that's the starting point.

335
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,670
Now when you have an anomaly, so we show

336
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,190
how you can create a
workflow that gets triggered

337
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,650
and then that workflow can
then automatically create

338
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,910
a repair plan, right?

339
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,760
So your operations team can
then take the repair plan

340
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,150
and then go ahead with
corrective actions, right?

341
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,210
And we show how you can do
that in a agentic fashion

342
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,030
using three agents, we use Strands SDK

343
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,530
to build these agents.

344
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,453
And then when Chris talks
about the second tutorial,

345
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,293
we'll talk about AgentCore, right?

346
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,220
So let me put down the architecture
for the first tutorial.

347
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,950
So you see pretty
straightforward on the left

348
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,860
we have SiteWise age
collecting data from machines.

349
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,670
So in this example we
use e-bike assembly line

350
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,070
as the sample scenario

351
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,239
and we collect data from
welding station, welding robots

352
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,370
and so on, the conveyor belts.

353
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,760
And then we use one specific
asset, welding robot,

354
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,460
to walk through the workflow, right?

355
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,540
And then on the right,

356
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,136
on the cloud side, you are SiteWise Cloud,

357
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:03,330
that's where the data is
modeled, sets are modeled

358
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,983
and data is stored securely.

359
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,140
And then we show the agent
workflow that's on the right

360
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,480
that has a number of data sources,

361
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,430
one SiteWise obviously.

362
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,110
And then there is Bedrock Knowledge Base.

363
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,170
So this is where we store all the manuals

364
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,190
for that equipment.

365
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,666
This could be equipment manuals,

366
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,600
standard operating procedures and so on.

367
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,200
And these are all connected
through MCP to the agent, right?

368
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,690
And when the workflow is triggered, again,

369
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,800
it's not one agent we, yeah,
here it looks like, you know,

370
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,970
we are showing it as one agent,

371
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,350
but it's actually three agents
working in a workflow manner.

372
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,090
And then one, the workflow
generates a repair plan

373
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,270
when it's triggered, right?

374
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,037
So the output is we
generate an HTML report,

375
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:51,840
we will store it in S3, we
will give you a pre-signed URL

376
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,000
so you can access the report, right?

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,060
In real world scenario,
this could be etiquette in,

378
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,030
you know, that gets created in, you know,

379
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,160
SAP PM or IBM Maximo.

380
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,440
But here we are just creating the report

381
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,093
and then putting it in S3.

382
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,450
Yeah, that's a high level architecture

383
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,680
for the first tutorial.

384
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,980
Any questions before we move on?

385
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,813
- [Chris] Yeah.

386
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,460
- [Attendee] What's the
trigger point from the sitewise

387
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,360
in the middle to the
predictive (indistinct)?

388
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,520
You guys have an algorithm
that's actually running this,

389
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,847
I actually wanna go to that
or are you sending everything-

390
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,484
- [Raju] So the trigger is an anomaly

391
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,390
being detected in SiteWise.

392
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,710
So that's the trigger.

393
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,500
So now you could define the threshold.

394
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,560
We use 0.5 say threshold
for anomaly scores.

395
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,060
So it's zero to one.

396
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,010
Again, you can adjust
depending on the criticality

397
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,110
of your mission, but 0.5 is the default.

398
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,270
So when we say there is an anomaly,

399
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,180
that's when the workflow
gets automatically triggered.

400
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,570
Now we use IoT core behind the scenes

401
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,610
for event driven workflows from SiteWise.

402
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,980
So today that's the recommended approach.

403
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,770
So when there is an active
anomaly in SiteWise,

404
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,781
SiteWise sends the MQTT
message to IoT Xore

405
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,858
on an event. driven basis,

406
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:10,710
and then IoT Core will trigger
the the agent workflow.

407
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,450
Yeah, that's the flow.

408
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,740
But for this tutorial, yeah,

409
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,440
we'll manually trigger the workflow,

410
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,390
but that's how you do it in production.

411
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,837
Can you repeat your question?

412
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:27,826
- [Chris] Your EC2?

413
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,430
- [Attendee] The data simulator?

414
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,263
- [Raju] Yes.

415
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:33,840
So in this case, we are simulating data

416
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
for that welding robot.

417
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,940
So in fact we have a physical
demo that we showcase,

418
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,970
even Venetian, you know,
there is a UVAC demo

419
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,900
that you'll see.

420
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,050
So what we did is we took
the data from a physical demo

421
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,920
and then we are replaying
the data using EC2, right?

422
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,540
Yeah.

423
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,870
But right now we, the
data for SiteWise coming

424
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,270
through EC2, not through SiteWise Edge,

425
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,010
but I still have SiteWise Edge there

426
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,600
because that's the recommended approach.

427
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,796
That's more cost efficient way
of, you know, ingesting data

428
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,690
through the cloud because it batches data

429
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,550
for you automatically.

430
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,383
Yeah.

431
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,030
Yep, please.

432
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,800
- [Attendee] Can I rip out SiteWise

433
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,129
and put something else there
but still use everything else?

434
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,730
- [Raju] Yeah. Yes.

435
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,563
- [Chris] Yeah.

436
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:18,750
- [Attendee] Is that just a MQTT topic

437
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,980
going in to actually communicate or-

438
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,240
- [Chris] Depends on the
triggering mechanism you would do

439
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,015
in your pipeline to drive an agent action.

440
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,040
- [Raju] Yeah, it could
be a Lambda, you know,

441
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,720
triggering as well.

442
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,220
Yeah, you don't need SiteWise.

443
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,340
We are just showing SiteWise as an example

444
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,890
for the industrial data foundation layer,

445
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,780
but it can be something else as well.

446
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,613
Yeah.

447
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,107
- [Chris] All right, great.
- [Raju] Okay.

448
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,520
- [Chris] Just gonna switch over to demo.

449
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,353
- [Raju] Yeah.

450
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,174
- [Chris] Alright.

451
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:58,486
- [Raju] Is it agreeable?

452
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,937
Should I zoom in a little bit?

453
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,320
Okay, so the repo that
we're gonna share with you,

454
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,107
so here is a repo on GitHub.

455
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:17,730
Sample agentic code generation

456
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,680
for industrial analytics.

457
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,360
So what you'll see here, we are just going

458
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,650
through this repo today and
we did all the prerequisites

459
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,885
to save, you know, time for you.

460
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:31,290
We have a QR code, you know,
we'll share that with you.

461
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,123
We do have that-

462
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,475
- [Chris] Yep. (indistinct)

463
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,830
- [Raju] Yeah, so what you see here

464
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,968
is essentially two Jupyter Notebooks.

465
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,743
So under predictive maintenance,

466
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,040
yeah, this is the first one.

467
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:47,497
- [Chris] The second
one, oh, the first one.

468
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,360
- [Raju] Yeah, first one.

469
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,590
So you'll see some prerequisites,

470
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,660
so this installs the knowledge base,

471
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,850
uploads the knowledge base documents.

472
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,960
Again, one more thing

473
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,830
to note is this report
is fully self-sufficient.

474
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,240
So you don't need to know SiteWise,

475
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,160
you don't need to know Bedrock.

476
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,750
We prepare the whole environment for you.

477
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,530
We can start with a blank
account, AWS account,

478
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,610
and then use this report.

479
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,640
We do everything for
you from data simulation

480
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,830
to preparing knowledge
base end to end, right?

481
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,093
It's self-sufficient.

482
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:19,410
So I did the prerequisite
already, so I'll not do it,

483
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,090
but I can just show you.

484
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,090
It's just preparing the
knowledge base using Python SDK.

485
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,050
And in the second example,
so this is the tutorial

486
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,670
for the repair plan
creation using Strands.

487
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,500
So these updated architecture,

488
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,530
but it's pretty much similar
to what we've saw seen earlier.

489
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,333
You can see three agents
working in a workflow pattern.

490
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,370
So, and then we'll go
through, I'll explain some

491
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,450
of the highlights from this notebook.

492
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,810
You can try it later in
your own account as well.

493
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,530
And then on the second tutorial, yeah,

494
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,043
we got a separate notebook.

495
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,330
This is for advanced analytics.

496
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,503
So Chris will talk about this use case.

497
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:18,210
Yeah, so that's the
repository to begin with.

498
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,533
So I did a clone of this
locally and then I'm using Kiro.

499
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,010
ID.

500
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,280
So I cloned this repo and
then I'm gonna start with,

501
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,873
so I have a virtual Python environment,

502
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:36,150
so I install all the packages.

503
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,133
Let me show you some dependencies here.

504
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,850
So because we are gonna use Strands SDK,

505
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,846
and Strands tools, so we
have those installed already

506
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:51,090
and then we use YAML for
some configuration, boto3,

507
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,090
to make certain calls to air services.

508
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,543
So it's all installed.

509
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,080
And now let me actually go

510
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,620
through the tutorial.

511
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,470
So the whole narrative, so
whatever is the use case

512
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,898
that we talked about around E-bikes,

513
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:13,860
so it's all baked into the
notebook, the whole scenario.

514
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,273
I will skip it for now.

515
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,095
Okay, so I will install
the requirements efficacy

516
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:27,330
all pre-installed.

517
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,010
So we'll import some modules.

518
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,208
So to those new to Strands,
so it's pretty important

519
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:37,620
to look into these
three import statements.

520
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,960
So first we are importing
the agent, right?

521
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,479
So this is used to invoke
the agent once we configure

522
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:49,479
the agent with prompt, system
prompt and foundation model.

523
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,100
And then tool, this is to
create a custom tool, right,

524
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,631
for your agent.

525
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:57,303
So this can extend the agent capabilities

526
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:02,153
beyond normal summarization, right?

527
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:05,430
We use tool here to create the HTML

528
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,406
or to save the HTML document
locally to the file system.

529
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,880
And then we use MCP client.

530
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,437
So we, we have three MCP servers we

531
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:15,960
are using in this tutorial.

532
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,720
So we got MCP client to
talk to those servers,

533
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,323
and then we use Bedrock
model, Anthropic model to tie

534
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,080
to the Strands agent.

535
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,850
- [Chris] Are people familiar
with agents and tools

536
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,200
and those terminologies?

537
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,173
Like is that something anyone
needs more information on?

538
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,960
- [Raju] You wanna do?
- [Chris] Yeah.

539
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,940
So if you look at agents,
it's gonna think of it

540
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,530
as gonna be like a persona, right.

541
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,240
We're gonna, it's gonna
be our maintenance person,

542
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,970
it could be an operational person, right?

543
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,470
And we're giving that agent

544
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,200
or person tools to do their job, right?

545
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,800
And those tools could be access
to data, access to an API.

546
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,565
And so when we say MCP,

547
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,030
and when we say tool, that's
really the same thing.

548
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,530
And then to confuse you a little bit more,

549
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,570
an agent is also a tool.

550
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,210
So an agent can have a set of tools

551
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,290
and a tool can be an agent
or it could be an MCP tool,

552
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,660
which is access to like APIs.

553
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,570
Now an agent is configured
within instruction.

554
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,950
That's what's different between tools

555
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,040
and agents is you define it in instruction

556
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,990
and the tools it has.

557
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,993
And you'll see that here as
we configure these agents.

558
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,863
- [Raju] Okay?

559
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,790
So we've imported the modules,

560
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,100
so we have some configuration, so we need

561
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,180
to pick the bucket where we
will write the HTML report

562
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,650
and then we configuring AWS
credentials using a profile.

563
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,410
So I'm pointing to a specific AWS account

564
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,790
where I'm gonna create that report into.

565
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,060
And then, so Chris was
mentioning the profile

566
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,353
for each agent, right?

567
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:54,330
So this is how you define
the characteristics

568
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,210
of the behavior of the agent.

569
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,540
So we create those prompts
in a markdown files,

570
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,542
we call it SOPs, so these are
system prompts essentially.

571
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,209
So you can find them for each agent.

572
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:11,310
So there is a separate markdown
that explains the behavior

573
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,190
for that, or the profile for that agent.

574
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,890
So for example, for ops data collector,

575
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,890
so this is the agent that
collects data from SiteWise,

576
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,890
so you can see the definition
for that agent, including,

577
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,690
you know, what it should
do, a quick overview

578
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,340
of what it does and what's
expected in terms of the sequence

579
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,660
that the agent should follow
broadly and some constraints.

580
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,763
So it's not completely understood.

581
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:44,070
So you'll find the SOPs for each agent.

582
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,570
So we are loading those system prompts,

583
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,320
so when we create agent,
we'll tie this prompt

584
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,574
which is in the markdown
file, to the agent.

585
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,360
And then we are loading them.

586
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,703
So I will just run it to load the SOPs.

587
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,569
So the next step is now we'll connect

588
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:04,440
to the MCP servers, right?

589
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,690
Now let's take SiteWise as an example.

590
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,285
You can talk to SiteWise, you know,

591
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:12,303
in a traditional way
using SDKs that we offer.

592
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:16,200
But then now you can use
SiteWise MCP server that we offer

593
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,730
and then plug your agent

594
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,063
so the agent can pick the
right tool that's available

595
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:23,220
to talk to SiteWise, both for reading

596
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,830
and writing operations, right?

597
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,510
- [Chris] And this tool,
there's a QR code at the end

598
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,090
for this MCP tool.

599
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,150
- [Raju] Yeah, these tools are
publicly available on GitHub,

600
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,560
we have a bunch of MCP servers,

601
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,630
there's some specific tools service.

602
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,670
There are also some
that are quite generic.

603
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,120
Let's say, AWS API MCP
server that can talk

604
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,950
to almost any service.

605
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,688
So we also use that here.

606
00:27:45,688 --> 00:27:49,440
So now we'll create MCP clients to talk to

607
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,990
because MCP's client,
server-based architecture.

608
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,263
So we create MCP client
to talk to those servers.

609
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:57,420
And here these are the three servers

610
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,860
we are gonna use, right?

611
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,480
SiteWise MCP server to collect
telemetry data for a period

612
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,600
of time and anomaly status
because that's all in living

613
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,470
in SiteWise.

614
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,040
And then another MCP server to talk

615
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,540
to Bedrock knowledge base.

616
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,800
So this is where we retrieve
the knowledge base details

617
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,307
around that equipment from the
equipment manuals and SOPs.

618
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,503
And finally, the API MCP server.

619
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,960
This is a generic MCP server.

620
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,830
We use it to create a file in S3, right?

621
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,660
So I'm not using a S3 MCP server,

622
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,677
but rather a common API MCP.

623
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,260
And then now we are gonna
create some helper functions

624
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,364
to create these MCP clients.

625
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,687
And when you create a client,
you can filter the tools

626
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:46,500
that you want to make it
available for the application.

627
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,700
So for example, let's say
in SiteWise you get about 50

628
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,670
or so tools part of the MCP server, right?

629
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,480
But you don't need all the tools
for all your agents, right?

630
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,170
If your agent is supposed
to just collect data,

631
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,440
live data or historical data,
you know, from an equipment,

632
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,739
you just need to use like maybe a fraction

633
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:08,160
of those tools, right?

634
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,308
So it saves you in terms

635
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:13,530
of the response times
execution time as well.

636
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,530
So we are filtering some tools
from SiteWise in this case.

637
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:21,510
So I'll show that in a moment.

638
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,130
But then here, this helper function,

639
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,212
all it does is it creates
a MCP client for you

640
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:30,540
based on the tool filters

641
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,080
and the command that you provide,

642
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,140
I mean, which is the
identifier for the MCP.

643
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,140
So I'll run this, okay, so the
helper function is created.

644
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,810
And then I have one more to
initialize the MCP clients.

645
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,390
So this is where I plug in the environment

646
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,170
and then you can see I have
three clients that I'm creating.

647
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,900
So client number one is for SiteWise,

648
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,820
and here is the identifier
for the SiteWise MCP server.

649
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,970
And then I'm using specific
tools, not every tool,

650
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,533
I just need five tools to
retrieve data from SiteWise.

651
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,750
Similarly, I got two more clients.

652
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,700
So Bedrock knowledge base client.

653
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,763
So here is the identifier
for Bedrock MCP server,

654
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,980
and third is for the AWS API MCP.

655
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,770
So this is the common MCP
server that I mentioned earlier.

656
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,800
So three MCP clients, right,

657
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,050
and then we are just
returning those clients.

658
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,483
So I'll exit here.

659
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,213
So it's done.

660
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,533
So finally, so, so far we
have created helper functions.

661
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:42,395
Now we'll actually execute,

662
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:45,570
initialize those three MCP clients

663
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,370
and we get back those three clients.

664
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,910
Yeah, it just takes a minute or so.

665
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,930
- [Chris] So any questions
on this configuration

666
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,457
you're seeing or something
you might wanna apply

667
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,080
to yourself?

668
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,170
- [Attendee] So just to
make sure I understand,

669
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,820
the SiteWise client (indistinct).

670
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,310
- [Chris] On this machine, you mean like,

671
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,560
or what does a client connection occur?

672
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,630
- [Attendee] Theoretically?

673
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,600
- [Chris] Yeah, so wherever
the agent is running,

674
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,690
which could be AgentCore's
runtime as an example,

675
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,220
it would be the client and you would have

676
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,316
to give it this authentication.

677
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,713
But the tool is brought down
to that agent that's running.

678
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,980
- [Raju] Okay.

679
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,053
So yeah, we are done.

680
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:37,414
We have the clients created
and connected to the servers,

681
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:39,510
and you can see for each client

682
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,328
the number of tools available.

683
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:45,357
And with that, let's move on

684
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:48,440
to creating the agents, right?

685
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,301
So we have the foundation
ready with the NCP.

686
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,210
Now, when you create agents,

687
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,010
you can also define your custom tools.

688
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,073
So, so far we haven't created
any custom tool, right?

689
00:31:59,073 --> 00:32:02,450
We are just using what's
available outta the box from AWS

690
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,280
part of the MCP servers.

691
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,100
So for us, in this case, just to show you

692
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,130
how you can extend the capability
of existing MCP servers

693
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,700
for your agent, here
we are creating a tool

694
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,593
to store the HTML report that
we generate locally, right,

695
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:22,590
and then that report gets copied to S3.

696
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,490
So this tool, all it does
is it takes HTML as input

697
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,170
and then stores locally.

698
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,122
Now to do that, to store a file locally,

699
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:36,780
either you can use like a
file server MCP, you know,

700
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,570
that has access to your file system

701
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,920
or you can do something like this, right?

702
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,940
Create a tool that does
a very specific task.

703
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,850
So here we are creating a custom tool,

704
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,750
and the way to do it in Strands
is using the tool decorator.

705
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,880
All it is is a Python function.

706
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,150
You add a tool decorator

707
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:57,753
and becomes a tool that's available

708
00:32:57,753 --> 00:32:59,482
for your agent, right?

709
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:03,300
So here, this is a tool to save HTML file.

710
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,643
You can see the definition of it.

711
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:08,310
All it does it's is it basically saves

712
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,410
the content to a file.

713
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,850
So nothing special here.

714
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,063
So I will create that tool definition.

715
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,090
Yep.

716
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,830
So now we are done with the tools, right?

717
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,852
We have all the tools, some
through MCP, some custom.

718
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:26,610
The next step is really
creating those agents, right?

719
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,820
So here we'll create some helper functions

720
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,200
again to create the agent.

721
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,130
So first we'll initiate the boto3 session.

722
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,250
So here I'm pointing to
a specific AWS account

723
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,840
using profiles.

724
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,630
And then I'm also picking
the Bedrock model,

725
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,790
the foundation model that
I'm going to use, right?

726
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,410
So for this tutorial, I'm
using Claude Sonnet 4.

727
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,539
So you can change under the model ID.

728
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,380
So these a common model I'm
using for all three agents.

729
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,270
- [Chris] And so with
Strands, you don't have

730
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,310
to use Bedrock, you can
actually use other types

731
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,843
of LLMs in your choice.

732
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:02,250
So that's an option.

733
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,013
- [Raju] Yeah, it's not tied to Bedrock.

734
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,530
And then it helps you
initialize those agents

735
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,053
as you can see here.

736
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,670
And while creating agents,
there are three things you need

737
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,440
to note, right?

738
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,065
So one is a system prompt,
essentially the profile

739
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:25,710
definition for that agent,

740
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,740
which we created in a
separate markdown file.

741
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,420
So agent one is ops data
collector, which is responsible

742
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,940
for collecting all the data from SiteWise.

743
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,400
And we have system prompt.

744
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,570
We are now attaching the
tools that are available

745
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,978
and the Bedrock model, right,

746
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:46,620
the common model that we defined earlier.

747
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,210
So that's the agent one.

748
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,880
Agent two is your knowledge retriever.

749
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,170
So the job here is to retrieve

750
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,560
knowledge related to that machine,

751
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,920
here it's a welding robot,
from the knowledge base, right?

752
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,380
So here we have a separate system prompt

753
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,210
so I can show you how it looks like.

754
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,503
So the definition here, it
says, is for a given asset,

755
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:12,510
the SOP retrieves relevant
information from Bedrock.

756
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,343
Pretty simple.

757
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:14,943
You can again fine tune this.

758
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,510
And then we have separate tools, right,

759
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,670
from the MCP, Bedrock tools,

760
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,870
and then we are using
the same Bedrock model

761
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,420
and finally a report generator, right?

762
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,940
So the job here is to summarize

763
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,430
and then create an HTML report

764
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,710
and then to copy that report to S3

765
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,178
and then to give you a pre-signed URL,

766
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:40,680
which is a temporary URL that's
valid for one hour, right?

767
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,680
Again, in real world,
this could be integration

768
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,653
with your ticketing or asset
management system, right?

769
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,110
So that's pretty much it.

770
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,150
So I will create the helper function

771
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,173
and finally I'll initialize the agents.

772
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:04,191
So now, so far we've created MCP clients,

773
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:05,820
we created a custom tool,

774
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,880
and then we've created
three agents, right?

775
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,790
It's creating, the agents
part is still going on,

776
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,490
it should take a minute and
we are almost there, right?

777
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,703
The final step is then
to execute the workflow.

778
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,843
So two agents we created already.

779
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,383
- [Chris] Any questions
while that's executing?

780
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:32,576
Okay.

781
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,750
- [Raju] Okay.

782
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,910
So yeah, we are done with the,

783
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,380
with creating the agents.

784
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,380
So finally, now, yeah, we need
to execute the agent, right?

785
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,410
So there are some, like when
you deal with multi-agent,

786
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,690
because here we are not just
talking about one agent,

787
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,000
there are three agents,
there are different ways

788
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,960
to design patterns for
multi-agent architecture, right?

789
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,860
And it's well documented in
Strands SDK documentation.

790
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,130
Some common patterns are listed down here.

791
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,920
The swarm, graph and workflow, right?

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,554
It really depends on how the,

793
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:14,673
it really depends on
the order of execution

794
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:18,690
that's best suited for
your use case, right?

795
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,013
If your use case demands
a sequential execution

796
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:25,800
of agent one, two, three,
which is probably the best fit

797
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,200
for our tutorial, right,

798
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,750
then you can take a workflow approach.

799
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,120
There is also graph approach
using a DAG, you know,

800
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,540
you can execute your agents
in a DAG, following a DAG.

801
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,480
Topology, or you can have
autonomous coordination

802
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,560
between your agents, right?

803
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,290
You don't define the order,
you leave it to your agents

804
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,780
to decide the handover process, right?

805
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,690
Can be agent one to two, back to one,

806
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,290
to three to two, right?

807
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,143
It depends on the question.

808
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,100
So again, it depends
on really the use case.

809
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,810
You can pick, you know,
one of those patterns.

810
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,860
So here we are using workflow pattern

811
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,553
because all we need is a report
following a sequential flow.

812
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:11,670
So here is a helper function

813
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,479
to create or to trigger that workflow.

814
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:17,400
We have all the three agents

815
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,557
and then you can see the
handover process, right?

816
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:21,540
Because it's a workflow,
we are defining the order.

817
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,620
So step one, we are calling the agent ops

818
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,990
data collector agent with the query,

819
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,300
process anomaly for asset name.

820
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,830
So the prompt here is to process anomaly

821
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,870
for a single asset, right,

822
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,180
which is a welding robot in this example.

823
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,090
And that goes to the agent one.

824
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,300
So agent one will come back
with all the data from SiteWise

825
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,520
for that specific asset, right?

826
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
And then it will then hand it over

827
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,710
to the knowledge retrieval, the agent two,

828
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,301
right, in the prompt for this agent two.

829
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:56,970
Along with the asset details,

830
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,716
we are also providing the
raw information gathered

831
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,850
by the agent one, right?

832
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,950
So that's step two.

833
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,430
And then now you have also,
in addition to sensor data,

834
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,130
the knowledge information as well.

835
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,700
Now we are feeding all
that to step three, right?

836
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,753
And then the prompt here is
to generate a pre-signed URL

837
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:21,570
for the analysis and then to
store the HTML report locally

838
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,870
and then to copy it to S3.

839
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,190
And then we have some parameters to point

840
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,710
to the right location in S3.

841
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,751
And that's pretty much it, right?

842
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:31,680
So this is essentially the workflow.

843
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,280
In Strands, there are new
tools that will help you

844
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,540
to manage workflow.

845
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,000
You don't need to manually
define a workflow.

846
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,380
There are better ways to do it,

847
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,560
but right now there's one way to do it.

848
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,573
So now I'll trigger this workflow,

849
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,675
and now you can see the whole interaction

850
00:39:52,675 --> 00:39:57,185
between the agent and
the MCP server, right?

851
00:39:57,185 --> 00:40:00,210
You can see the tools
that the agent is calling

852
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,180
to get the relevant information
depending on the prompt.

853
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,250
So the first step is to figure out,

854
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,314
to identify the asset, right?

855
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:08,730
So we are asking the agent

856
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,800
to process anomaly for a welding robot.

857
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,131
So it has to figure out
where that asset is SiteWise.

858
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:17,970
So the first step is it'll
really find the asset ID

859
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,130
for that welding robot and it does it

860
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,670
by calling list asset models,
list assets describe asset,

861
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,670
and then it found the
asset, sorry, the asset ID,

862
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,990
and then using the asset
id, it's making a batch call

863
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,560
because in the system prompt,

864
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,270
we were explicitly asking the agent

865
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,910
to use batch calls wherever possible.

866
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,440
So it is using batch
get asset property value

867
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:45,833
to get the sensor data from the machine.

868
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:47,670
- [Chris] So that's really cool.

869
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,503
The agent's able

870
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:49,410
to look at the tools

871
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,980
and know that the order of
which it should call, which API

872
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,010
to ultimately get to
that ID, right, which is-

873
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,843
- [Raju] Yeah.

874
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:59,280
And then now you can see
the flow from agent two.

875
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,600
So agent one flow is done,
got back all the central data.

876
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,061
So agent two is now retrieving
the data from the knowledge

877
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:08,670
base as you can see.

878
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,960
So it's doing a list knowledge base,

879
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,543
it's picking up the right
knowledge base to query.

880
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,080
And then...

881
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,230
Yeah, you can actually see the response

882
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,630
from the knowledge base too.

883
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,530
Yeah, it shows you a
high temperature warning

884
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,700
around 80 degrees for join zero

885
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
and some recommended actions
including the error codes.

886
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,725
So these error code is coming

887
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:42,270
from a knowledge base document, right,

888
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,900
stored in S3 through
Bedrock knowledge base.

889
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,830
And then some recommendations,
you know, like looking

890
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:53,430
for obstructions and so on.

891
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,690
And then it also did some
analysis around the joint velocity

892
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,423
to give you more insights,
some risk assessment.

893
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:06,270
Some contact details as
well from the OEM, again,

894
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,070
which is part of the knowledge base.

895
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,630
And then it's generating the report

896
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,760
and then it's saving locally.

897
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,943
Let me show you how it looks like on S3.

898
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,273
Oh, it's gone.

899
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,327
Just gimme one second. I will take a...

900
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,963
Yeah, I'll show you a sample
report while it's running.

901
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,850
Yeah, so this is one I ran
like one hour ago or, yeah.

902
00:42:45,552 --> 00:42:47,790
So what you see here is a report

903
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,070
for that anomaly workflow, right?

904
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,023
It gives you the life
status of the machine,

905
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:55,020
the results from the knowledge base.

906
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,870
So like I said, the issue is caused due

907
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,560
to high temperature and
high velocity at that join.

908
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,163
So it gives you the error code
map from the knowledge base,

909
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:08,610
some root cause analysis
from the knowledge base,

910
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,990
action plan.

911
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,370
Again, this can be formatted, right?

912
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,050
You can fine tune the system prompt

913
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,740
to format the report, that's possible.

914
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,890
So yeah, see the maintenance
schedule, some warnings,

915
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,590
contact details and so on.

916
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,900
So yeah, that's pretty much it.

917
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,840
I wanted to show in
this tutorial, you know,

918
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,480
like how you can start
all the way from no agent

919
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,683
to prototyping a multi-agent
workflow to help you,

920
00:43:36,477 --> 00:43:38,927
you know, troubleshoot
issues with your machines.

921
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:43,860
Now this is pretty much
for prototyping, right?

922
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,820
So when you're trying to move these agents

923
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,580
to production environment,
so that is where

924
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,861
you would probably look into
something like AgentCore,

925
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:56,182
and where you make your MCP servers

926
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:59,070
and tools more discoverable
using AgentCore.

927
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,451
Right now we are doing
all locally using Strands.

928
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:05,283
Really great for like
prototyping in this case.

929
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,490
So now I'll hand it over to Chris.

930
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,730
So before I do that, let me
give you a quick context, right?

931
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,520
So in this tutorial we did a,

932
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,510
we processed one anomaly,
right, in a operational context,

933
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,550
in a live operational context.

934
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,090
But then when you see
anomalies occurring regularly,

935
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,690
frequently for a type of
mission from a vendor,

936
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,270
for example, for a period
of time, you may want

937
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,090
to dig deep into, you
know, what's going on,

938
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,390
what are those common patterns, right?

939
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,880
So that's where advanced
analytics comes into play, right?

940
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,090
So this is where someone
from the operations team

941
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,850
or a data scientist would
actually go into and see,

942
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,160
look into, you know, different equipment

943
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,990
under the same equipment class,

944
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,810
same equipment class for
example, to see, you know,

945
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,470
what's causing those
frequently occurring anomalies.

946
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,132
So Chris will show you
a different workflow

947
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:02,460
that will help you do
exploratory analytics, right,

948
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,020
on again, the same,

949
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,750
it could be same machine
class like welding robots

950
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,760
to look at a historical data set, right?

951
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,390
Let's say last two years or
last two months or six months.

952
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,720
And to give you some common
patterns that you can use

953
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,110
and prevent anomalies
from happening, right?

954
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,850
But this workflow we saw is,

955
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,740
let's say you have an active anomaly,

956
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,730
how do you respond, right?

957
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,590
That's what we are
showing in this tutorial.

958
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,150
But in the next tutorial we'll show more

959
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,610
on historical data analysis, right?

960
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,860
That's where advanced
analytics comes into play.

961
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,693
- [Chris] Okay.

962
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:35,373
- [Raju] Any questions before
we hand it over to Chris?

963
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,473
- [Chris] Great.

964
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:42,257
Alright thanks. (indistinct)

965
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,820
Yeah, so we're gonna, like you said,

966
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,417
go some advanced analytics

967
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,077
and so we'll just kind
of paint the picture.

968
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:49,800
There's this trying to address

969
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,060
the manufacturing skills gap, right?

970
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,320
So the challenges that we have
a need to access, you know,

971
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,720
data insights and really do this quickly

972
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,090
without having to rely
on external IT teams

973
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,420
and data scientists to really
analyze the big picture

974
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,050
of why I have maybe an excessive
anomalies being detected.

975
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,630
So think of Sarah,
she's a process engineer

976
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,530
and she sees that motor 01
is sounding off again, right?

977
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,394
One of my joints is
triggering again, an issue.

978
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:18,615
So with this we want to show how we

979
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:22,321
can use Bedrock AgentCore
and first party tools

980
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:26,100
that it has, tools that
we build and maintain,

981
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,580
to actually execute and
generate code on the fly.

982
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,100
So you ask it to do some
analysis, it will start

983
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,060
to pull NumPy and SkyPy and
all these other libraries

984
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,860
used for data analytics

985
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,720
and really start to take that data

986
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,183
and bring it through a whole, you know,

987
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,380
even creating machine learning,
linear regression models.

988
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,460
It's really pretty fascinating.

989
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,167
You'll see what it does.

990
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,600
So it looks up, you can
look up equipment specs,

991
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,880
you can look up other information you need

992
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,166
in this process of analysis,

993
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:58,445
and this all happens in the sandbox

994
00:46:58,445 --> 00:47:02,141
within that AgentCore environment.

995
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:03,960
And so that's what code
interpreter does here, right?

996
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,284
It lets you execute and
generate code securely.

997
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:10,050
And you can do this on
large scale of data, right?

998
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,820
We're thinking like could be gigabytes

999
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,040
of data you might have
that you want to take

1000
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,985
through this analytical process.

1001
00:47:15,985 --> 00:47:17,450
And it makes it easy to use.

1002
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,500
It can execute code in JavaScript

1003
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,283
and TypeScript, Python and
other types of languages.

1004
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,039
All right?

1005
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,497
So that's what we we're gonna see,

1006
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:30,000
process engineer, we'll talk to the agent,

1007
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,730
it will then pull access
from code interpreters

1008
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,877
and other data points to run that code

1009
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:39,180
and then store it in memory.

1010
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,740
So with AgentCore memory, we're able

1011
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,588
to actually store this
conversations and these results

1012
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:46,380
and then Sarah can come back

1013
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,330
and say, Hey, you know, I have
a follow up question, right?

1014
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,890
And essentially with memory
module for AgentCores,

1015
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,760
you can create short-term
memories and long-term memories.

1016
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,910
So imagine like you have this
lot, a lot of conversations

1017
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,920
that occur over a period of time.

1018
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,900
You might be able to create
this semantic relationship

1019
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,940
between things and it
can recall that memory

1020
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,683
for you when you talk to it.

1021
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,080
Alright, let me go back
to, switch to demo.

1022
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:16,146
Yeah.

1023
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,810
Okay. So we'll go to advanced analytics.

1024
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,493
I'll close out some things.

1025
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,580
Okay, so here's initial start here.

1026
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,330
We'll actually go ahead
and install the libraries

1027
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,879
like we need like before,

1028
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,879
so we won't have to go into that detail.

1029
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,360
We will actually create
this code interpreter module

1030
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,280
and substantiate that,
and it's based on regions.

1031
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,810
So we support a couple of regions,

1032
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,770
I can't remember all of them,

1033
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,713
but we're gonna use US East
One, which is Virginia.

1034
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,260
And this is part of
the AgentCore libraries

1035
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,880
that we're using.

1036
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,000
So if you look above, there's
actually this AgentCore

1037
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,560
Python library that we'll use

1038
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,183
for accessing code interpreter.

1039
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,890
All right, let's go ahead

1040
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,210
and load the equipment data

1041
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,690
that we have from the anomaly
test that we did, right?

1042
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,060
We're seeing now we're
generating excessive amount

1043
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,130
of anomalies and we need

1044
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,230
to really do some deep analysis into that.

1045
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,373
- [Attendee] How many rows

1046
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:33,480
are in that data frame right there?

1047
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,860
- [Chris] How many rows ended up-

1048
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,693
- [Raju] Thousand

1049
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:36,526
- [Chris] Thousand?

1050
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:39,601
- [Raju] We want it to be
done quickly, so it's pretty-

1051
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,150
(group laughing)

1052
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,350
- [Chris] It executes and
then we'll wait for 20,

1053
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,313
30 minutes.

1054
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,760
- [Raju] Yeah, it's just one month

1055
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,985
of data sampled every minute.

1056
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:51,570
- [Chris] Yeah, so you see several joints,

1057
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,030
temperature, velocity, and
various types of joints

1058
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,833
that exist in that robotic arm.

1059
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,463
So we're trying to get through that.

1060
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,050
Alright, that's done right?

1061
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,380
Okay, we need tools, right?

1062
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,300
Helper functions, this is
like you saw, we won't go

1063
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,800
into that detail again,
but this is something that,

1064
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,150
you know, Raju mentioned, right,

1065
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,910
you need some helper
functions to open files

1066
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,150
and also prepare for
the sandbox environment.

1067
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,890
So we're taking some of that data

1068
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,751
and putting into a CSV into that sandbox

1069
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:22,410
and then more helper tools, right,

1070
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,810
to be able to call that tool.

1071
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,780
So these are not that
important, but writing

1072
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,630
and listing the files
you have in the sandbox.

1073
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,493
So we're gonna create that as well.

1074
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,350
Now here's a great part,
right? The fun part.

1075
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,270
You're creating that
agent's persona, right?

1076
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,458
So you're telling them you
are an industrial IoT data

1077
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,750
analyst assistant, right?

1078
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,890
And so you're specialized really

1079
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,830
in detecting this equipment
health and monitoring.

1080
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,837
And it gives you all
these principles you have

1081
00:50:51,837 --> 00:50:54,855
and the tools you might want to access.

1082
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:57,183
So you need to execute
Python and CD output.

1083
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,336
So we'll go ahead and
create that system prompt,

1084
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:05,163
which we'll use coming up soon.

1085
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,513
Now we want to create our tools.

1086
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:11,101
So I'm gonna go ahead and create
a tool for code interpreter

1087
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,630
that Strands will use.

1088
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,213
I'll create one for the
equipment knowledge.

1089
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,450
So we'll create that as well.

1090
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,340
And then we need to enable memory.

1091
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,676
So in this example you'll see it,

1092
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:23,509
it's actually you don't want

1093
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:24,750
to use this code in production,

1094
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,060
but it's, it's looking
for the existing memory

1095
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,410
and it's like wiping it out, right?

1096
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,210
So you can start fresh.

1097
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,100
So you don't wanna be wiping
your memory every time

1098
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,040
this thing runs, but it just
kind of gives you an example

1099
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,550
of how you can set up your
memory and create hooks.

1100
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,680
So with AgentCore you can create this hook

1101
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,290
where every time there's a
response, the hook triggers

1102
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,120
and it takes their memory and stores it.

1103
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,120
So that's what we're doing in this code.

1104
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,242
And so if we go down to
the bottom, you'll see

1105
00:51:56,242 --> 00:51:58,710
that it's found that
existing memory, right?

1106
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,800
Oh, it's active, I'm
cleaning up your old events,

1107
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,803
deleted 18, memory is now
ready for fresh analysis.

1108
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:05,400
So just be aware of that, right,

1109
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,050
when you're looking at this code.

1110
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:11,820
Now with Strands and agents,

1111
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,150
you need to now configure that to be aware

1112
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,620
of the memory module.

1113
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,080
You need to be aware of the tools it has.

1114
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,810
And so that's what we're
actually configuring here

1115
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,630
is configuring the model
to use the memory hooks

1116
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,830
that we're gonna have
for the memory module.

1117
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,553
And then this line of code,

1118
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,320
we want agent with memory.

1119
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,410
So we create that agent,
we (indistinct) the model,

1120
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,284
the tools that will
have that system prompt,

1121
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:42,840
the hooks that will then
trigger the memory module

1122
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,743
to be used.

1123
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,380
Any questions on that line?

1124
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,910
That's an important line, right?
'cause you're actually like

1125
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,283
really setting up the
agent's capabilities.

1126
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,543
Okay?

1127
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,200
Now one more helper function for displays.

1128
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,990
We'll go ahead and run our first analysis

1129
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,723
and that's probably the time we'll have.

1130
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,680
There is actually more
follow-up questions we can do

1131
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,000
to really test the memory.

1132
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,850
But we're gonna actually run this example

1133
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,060
where the welding robot has
several anomalies lately

1134
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,220
and we want to understand,
you know, what kind

1135
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,103
of overall analysis you can
perform on that data file.

1136
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,710
So let's go ahead and run this

1137
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,263
and I'll minimize this code.

1138
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,671
So look what it did, right?

1139
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,646
Code, generated code,
import pandas, import NumPy,

1140
00:53:38,646 --> 00:53:39,479
import matplot, right?

1141
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:42,423
It's actually like a data
scientist creating the code

1142
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:44,613
that it will use to do this analysis.

1143
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,360
It starts creating its own plots, right?

1144
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,663
So I'm gonna create this
cullable so you can see.

1145
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,140
This takes about a
minute and a half, right?

1146
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,860
So as you see it create, you
know, the different graphs

1147
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,680
for anomalies, different
bound, lower and upper bounds.

1148
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,072
These are things I don't
know myself, right?

1149
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:05,489
I'm not a data analyst,

1150
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:09,690
but really gives you the
power of oh no, what happened?

1151
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,523
Okay.

1152
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,160
- [Raju] I think it's a throttling issue.

1153
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,110
- [Chris] Might be.

1154
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:18,510
- [Raju] Yeah, we are
limited to how many calls

1155
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,830
we can make to Bedrock
model during this week.

1156
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,523
- [Chris] Yep.

1157
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,064
- [Raju] Yeah, it could
hit again. Yeah, hit again.

1158
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:30,383
- [Chris] Yeah, we'll
give it a second chance.

1159
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,873
Yeah, this is a lot of
usage on Claude for sure,

1160
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,454
but it gives you idea, you'll be able

1161
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:47,287
to execute this hopefully as well.

1162
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,390
If this fails again, hopefully it doesn't,

1163
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,130
but you'll be able to
execute this on your own

1164
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,930
and see the results.

1165
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,803
Yeah. Okay.

1166
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,983
Alright.

1167
00:54:57,983 --> 00:55:01,470
Well what would you
see is essentially just

1168
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,123
as a result, it would have the,

1169
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,780
it would actually show the correlations

1170
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,875
between these different anomalies

1171
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:09,708
and different sensor issues

1172
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:12,102
and be able to tell you that, oh, okay,

1173
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:13,590
this is what's something
you need to perform

1174
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,556
a repair plan on or perform

1175
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:16,620
more scheduled maintenance against.

1176
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,410
And so there's different
types of advice I would give

1177
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:23,400
that's really helps you
create that direction on

1178
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,890
how you can optimize your equipment.

1179
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:28,290
Maybe there is specific specifications

1180
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,070
or settings that you need to
adjust to the machine specs.

1181
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,266
So it's really cool, it
gives you a whole report.

1182
00:55:34,266 --> 00:55:35,099
I wish I could show you that end here.

1183
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,590
- [Raju] Yeah, you
wanna try one more time?

1184
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,200
- [Chris] Sorry, one more
time. I have a video.

1185
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,550
It failed back too.

1186
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,710
- [Raju] Yeah, let's pull
out the video and see

1187
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,663
if it works this time.

1188
00:56:00,252 --> 00:56:01,193
- [Attendee] It's like
the meme where it's like,

1189
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:04,890
sorry boss, props down,
but I ran out (indistinct).

1190
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,563
- [Chris] Yeah, I know, right?

1191
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,790
Yeah, no, it's like Claude gets
hit a lot during re:Invent.

1192
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,471
So it's all these workshops and-

1193
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,737
- [Raju] Yeah, but you can
already see the analysis, right,

1194
00:56:17,737 --> 00:56:18,570
in the print statements, right?

1195
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,540
So it says there's no strong
correlation between sensors,

1196
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,690
so it's trying to print into a report.

1197
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,120
Where it's failing is
generating that report,

1198
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,520
but the analysis, it's already being done.

1199
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,490
You can see the distribution
of simultaneous analysis.

1200
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,040
You can see that it's
finding the common patterns,

1201
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,253
the baseline behavior for certain sensors.

1202
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:41,491
And also the data quality.

1203
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:43,680
It also checks that missing data,

1204
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,210
gives you a data quality report,

1205
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,050
which could be causing
maybe false positives

1206
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,450
as anomalies in SiteWise.

1207
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,070
Yeah, that's another
insight you could get out

1208
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,413
of this advanced analytics report.

1209
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,003
- [Chris] We get lucky.
Third time's a charm?

1210
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,000
Any questions while this loads?

1211
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,760
We got three minutes left.

1212
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,233
So that's is your chance,

1213
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,890
- [Raju] You wanna show the console maybe

1214
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:12,594
in the meanwhile, the console.

1215
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:13,713
- [Chris] Oh yeah.

1216
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,750
- [Attendee] What does
production look like?

1217
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,593
Like at scale.

1218
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,520
- [Chris] For this type of solution?

1219
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,130
Like a, and you're providing it

1220
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,185
for the analysis point of view.

1221
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:33,003
Let's just advanced analysis. Yeah.

1222
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:34,973
So you're giving that access to-

1223
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:38,060
(attendee speaking faintly off mic)

1224
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,810
50,000 devices, I mean
whether you're perform it

1225
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,330
across all those, right?

1226
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,390
There's you trying to
look at it holistically as

1227
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,400
an issue that might be occurring

1228
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,548
across many devices and sensors.

1229
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,736
- [Attendee] It's more
like this right here,

1230
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:51,752
like how does this scale out?

1231
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:54,027
Even (indistinct) manufacturing plant,

1232
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:56,612
you have 500 to a thousand devices

1233
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:58,590
inside of single manufacturing plant.

1234
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,745
So like from a production perspective,

1235
00:57:59,745 --> 00:58:03,371
are you heavily reliant on site SiteWise

1236
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:05,400
to be able to actually go

1237
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,913
and pinpoint what gets sent
into here and so forth?

1238
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,970
- Yeah. It leaves that up to human decide

1239
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,170
some of those things, right?

1240
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,363
Likeas opposed to like
giving it all the data points

1241
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:17,513
and saying make sense of this, right,

1242
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:19,814
if there's a particular operation

1243
00:58:19,814 --> 00:58:21,172
or process area that you're looking at

1244
00:58:21,172 --> 00:58:22,800
and you're trying to
address potential issues,

1245
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,761
then you might be able
to narrow your scope.

1246
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:29,748
- Yeah. But from a data
management spec, yeah,

1247
00:58:29,748 --> 00:58:32,370
SiteWise is fully managed,
it's highly scalable.

1248
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:35,490
So we have customers using
SiteWise for thousands of assets.

1249
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:36,510
They onboard those assets

1250
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:41,280
and then SiteWise can scale
in even in terms of anomaly,

1251
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,160
you know, giving out you
those anomalies, detecting

1252
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,306
and triggering event based
workflows that's highly scalable

1253
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:49,594
through SiteWise because
it's fully managed for you.

1254
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:52,770
- So it actually ran for time.
- Yeah.

1255
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,830
- So we see critical issues found right?

1256
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,630
Joint zero, urgent attention required.

1257
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,380
We see 27 extreme temperature
anomalies reading up

1258
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,030
to 87 degrees Celsius.

1259
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:05,520
And so it shows this
like correlation between

1260
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,672
joint temperature and velocity anomalies

1261
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:12,213
and really starts to break
down these issues, right?

1262
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,132
It also looks at what are
normal operating ranges.

1263
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:19,030
(attendee speaking faintly off mic)

1264
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,690
There is some specs that
it pulled from the machine

1265
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,180
to know these are my operating ranges.

1266
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,180
It looks at the data points
correlates that together,

1267
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,790
creates all that code
to perform that analysis

1268
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,520
and create those plots
like you saw in the code.

1269
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,418
- I mean the more context
the better, right?

1270
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:36,251
So in this case it's just the sensor data

1271
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:37,770
and the knowledge based documentation.

1272
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:40,320
But you can bring in
more MCP servers to talk

1273
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,820
to more systems.

1274
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,130
You get a better analysis.

1275
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:47,250
- We also said like we
intentionally made some data missing

1276
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,350
and it detected that too saying, Hey,

1277
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,954
I see data quality issues, you know, 67%

1278
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,940
of this missing across joints.

1279
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,391
And so that's, I saw
your hand up there. Yeah.

1280
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:58,660
What's your question?

1281
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,160
(attendee speaking faintly off mic)

1282
01:00:11,557 --> 01:00:12,390
By updating your index.

1283
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:13,859
and update your embeddings
and do you want the rest,

1284
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:16,785
the manual stove bit, that joint
temperature range is a typo

1285
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:19,345
(attendee speaking faintly off mic)

1286
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:22,812
or something you wanna hold on the update

1287
01:00:22,812 --> 01:00:27,812
If you identified the chunk
where that's embed, we extract

1288
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,760
that from, but I can get,
I, that's a good question.

1289
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,870
I need to follow up and we do

1290
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,423
after and see how we can do that.

1291
01:00:39,989 --> 01:00:42,120
But yeah, it gives you a full
report of what you need to do

1292
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,893
and maintenance recommendations.

1293
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,310
- You can further enhance
it to show like plots.

1294
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,690
So we're not showing plots here.

1295
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:52,260
You can do pay wise plots,
correlation analysis,

1296
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,090
and we can do a scatter plots

1297
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,507
and all that part of the workflow.

1298
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:58,323
We are not displaying,

1299
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:00,990
we are actually doing
it, but not displaying.

1300
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,087
- Great.
- Yeah. Oh, we are time.

1301
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:03,750
- Great.
- Yeah. Oh, we are at time.

1302
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,398
- Any questions on what you've seen?

1303
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:07,283
(overlapping chatter)

1304
01:01:07,283 --> 01:01:08,676
and you can try it in your own account.

1305
01:01:08,676 --> 01:01:09,670
And the second is the list of MCP servers.

1306
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,141
I think we are pointing to SiteWise MCP,

1307
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:13,141
but in the same GitHub
repo you'll see all the CPS

1308
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:14,206
that we provide to talk to
a number of AWS services.

1309
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:15,210
And third is some examples
to get started with AgentCore

1310
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,209
to really scale your agents
to production. Right?

1311
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:17,210
- Yep.
- So

1312
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,220
- Awesome.

1313
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,226
Well thank you. Thanks
for joining our session.

1314
01:01:19,226 --> 01:01:20,221
- Thank you. Thank you all
for spending time with us.

1315
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:21,054
Thank you.
