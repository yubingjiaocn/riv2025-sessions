1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
- Can I get the water?

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,350
I don't, sorry. (chuckles)

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,970
I dunno where the water went.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,520
All right, welcome. Look,
I know it's happy hour.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,500
I know you have dinner plans

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,290
and I'm gonna just
start with that in mind,

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,900
and I will let you know the
whole reason I'm up here

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,870
is that I hope that you guys go back there

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,263
to Booth 435 and check
out Sonrai, thank you.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,810
That's the agenda, right?

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,810
So, we have been partnered
with them this past year

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,910
and this presentation is
really about that partnership

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,100
and what we found valuable about that,

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,646
and hopefully you can do similar.

15
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:39,646
(people chattering)

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,440
Really, there's gonna
be four simple steps.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,850
What was Fiserv's challenge?

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,980
Why were we looking for anything?

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,140
Number two, we're gonna talk
about tools a little bit,

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,450
and what can feel like when you're trying

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,560
to go through the process.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
Then also the turning point.

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,760
What was it that we did with Sonrai

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,560
that actually made a difference

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,140
and why we then chose to
actually move forward?

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,214
And then of course the results.

27
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:05,010
(people chattering)

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,130
So, Fiserv is a financial
services company.

29
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,340
We're global and we probably,
I think it's been said

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,290
that we touch every household
in the United States.

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,600
I don't know if that's
physically true or not,

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,450
but we have grown and we have merged,

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,690
and we still continue to buy
companies and merge companies.

34
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,350
And that has led to over a period of years

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,510
where we are now multi-cloud.

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,310
We have thousands of accounts.

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,400
We have to manage those globally as well.

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
And so what happens is
every time you bring

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,810
another company together,
buy another product,

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,690
you have this permissions tornado,

41
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,310
for lack of a better word, right?

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,790
And IAM is difficult and we know

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,850
because when AI is all the hype,

44
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,240
And of course we work
in a regulated industry,

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,580
so you will always have to prove

46
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,010
that you have your cloud under control.

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,800
And so one of the things that
we were trying to implement,

48
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,420
especially with the rise of AI,

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,317
'cause, you know, everybody wants to know,

50
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:06,240
"What are you doing about AI?

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,890
What are you doing about AI?"

52
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,850
So, we had actually tried
to implement some controls

53
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,580
and we didn't fully,

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,640
well, we made an assumption
about some SCP inheritance

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,960
then turned out it worked that way

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,610
and we actually took an outage.

57
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,360
And so this happened
like middle of last year,

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,100
right before AWS Reinforce.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,160
And so it just happened to be at Reinforce

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,870
where I saw, I was swag hunting, right?

61
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,030
We all walk around, we look for swag

62
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,300
and in that process I ran across Sonrai.

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,430
There's some thing there
called a Zombie Hunter

64
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,050
and I was attracted to that.

65
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,940
And so, you know, walk up,

66
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,260
and we do some small talk,

67
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,851
we exchange what are you doing here?

68
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:53,060
And but in that process
they said we automate

69
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,320
creation and deployment of SCPs.

70
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,300
At that point, I forgot about the T-shirt

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,680
that I was hunting for.

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,750
I forgot about the sticker.

73
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,300
We exchanged numbers,
we had a second date,

74
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,230
we did a POC with them
and that went great.

75
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,660
There was a few cloud formation templates.

76
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,090
I think it was like 30 minutes to set up,

77
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,220
Ryan, my partner who set that up.

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,100
And it took several
days to do the analysis,

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,640
and when we saw the numbers,
which we'll show you

80
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,850
more of this in a bit,
it was like, hey wait,

81
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,840
there's more to this than
just our immediate need.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,960
So, we said, "Let's see about buying it.

83
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,279
Like let's continue this relationship."

84
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,290
(people chattering)

85
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,970
And then this is what happened.

86
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,040
Now, I'll tell you right up
front, this has nothing to do

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,533
with Sonrai, this was our processes,

88
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,280
but real questions.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,810
Do we need another tool?

90
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,580
Why this tool?

91
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,170
Don't we already have
a tool that does that?

92
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,020
Who's gonna pay for it even
after we get it up and running?

93
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,600
Who's gonna operate
it? Is it a cyber tool?

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,930
Is it a cloud infrastructure
tool? Like what is it?

95
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,727
And so for us, the fact
that we did the POC,

96
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,830
and I would encourage you to do a POC,

97
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,180
is that we had our data
right there for us to see.

98
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,590
And it was easy to do demos

99
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,900
with other partners in our business

100
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,790
and in particular leadership.

101
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,230
And when we did work out the fact

102
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,880
that Sonrai offered something

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,813
that we didn't have in any
other tool in any other way,

104
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:30,120
and it was even more than
that, we decided to go ahead.

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,490
And the reason I brought all of that up

106
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,060
is because this is what
it feels like sometimes

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,830
when everything's going on.

108
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,530
One more meeting. One more question.

109
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,360
Do we do it again? (chuckles)

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,090
It's worth it, if the solution,

111
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,287
if any solution here, if it
fixes your need, it's worth it.

112
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,960
And that to me is why we did that.

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,600
All right, one second.

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,230
So, this is where I'm gonna
spend most of this time.

115
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,534
I'm actually gonna explain this.

116
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,710
(people chattering)
(Brent drinking water)

117
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,560
Sorry about that.

118
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,010
And I'm only gonna explain
enough for you to be interested

119
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,690
to go to Booth 435.

120
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,833
Remember my agenda.

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,220
So, at the top, what
you'll see is the scope,

122
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,230
in the little dropdown at the top.

123
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,820
You can do that at the root org,

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,010
any of your OUs,

125
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,940
or you can go down to individual accounts.

126
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,560
And by the way, these are not our numbers.

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,793
This is a stock photo.

128
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,090
Whatever scope you pick,
those numbers will change

129
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,690
to reflect what's based on that scope.

130
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,280
So, what is this?

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,800
These are hero cards I assume

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,140
because you're a hero if
you take action on those.

133
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,040
The first one is, IAM users

134
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,000
and roles with excessive permissions.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,380
So, the easiest way to say this,

136
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,500
this is where we show you all the policies

137
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,780
that were probably written
with a wild card, right?

138
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,040
They're over permission,

139
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,560
but in particular they're not in use.

140
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,840
So, they're being flagged not
just being over permissive,

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,460
they're just not being used.

142
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,270
And you can take action
by clicking on that button

143
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,220
and it'll stage some
stuff, it'll do some stuff.

144
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm not gonna tell you all
the stuff that it does,

145
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,880
that's these guys' job.

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,933
But what it does is it
prevents them from being used.

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,573
And if they try to use them,

148
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,140
it'll set off an alert so to speak.

149
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,990
And there's a workflow then
that you can take to give people

150
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,720
that permission to use
those if they need to.

151
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
But what it does is quickly gives you

152
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,753
that layer of control.

153
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,450
The second one, the whole reason

154
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,700
I was hunting those
stickers, the zombie hunters.

155
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,380
Zombies represent identities
which haven't been used.

156
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,600
It's not about the permission
just not being used, right?

157
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,640
It's junk in your accounts.

158
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,980
And again, much like this protection here,

159
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,360
you can quarantine the zombies

160
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,850
such that whenever somebody try,

161
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,240
like say it was a
quarterly thing that runs.

162
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
When that happens, again,
there's a workflow,

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,410
it'll get triggered.

164
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,530
Someone can then take action,
ask, okay, they can reach out

165
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,780
to that team, "Hey, I see
this alert, what is it?

166
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,920
Do you really need it?"

167
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,700
And there's, and again,
those action automation

168
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,440
and then also the workflow behind it.

169
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,743
Those were the things that
we didn't have in our system.

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,610
We don't, by the way, we
predate control tower,

171
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,310
we have our own control tower so to speak.

172
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,620
And this type of stuff
wasn't built into that,

173
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,900
at least not in this way.

174
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,470
The third one is the
one that is what we were

175
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,110
really looking for out of the gate, right?

176
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,110
We have new services, new
AI services coming out,

177
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,030
we're gonna leave here, there'll be more,

178
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,910
and you can use this

179
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,700
to turn them on or turn them off.

180
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,920
And so it was nice to
be able to see across

181
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,800
thousands and thousands
of counts just how much

182
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,160
we have in use, not in use.

183
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,690
And then we can drill down to any level.

184
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,780
So, anytime we're working
with one of our teams,

185
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,490
one of the app dev teams,
we can pull this up

186
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,070
and we can get just
another view of the data

187
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,230
that shows they have junk in there,

188
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,910
over permission stuff in there,

189
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,230
and do they need that service?

190
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,870
So, we use that now as part of the AI COE,

191
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,100
our Center of Excellence,

192
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,440
that when teams have an AI project,

193
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
they can come, they get approved

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,693
and this is how we turn those
services back on for them.

195
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,020
The third or the third parties
was actually not something

196
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,390
that was on there when
we first looked at it.

197
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,963
That was something they
were adding and that,

198
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,200
or it might have been the
regions, I forget now.

199
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,290
But anyway, the third party is,
the nice thing about that is

200
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,390
in a single place we can go

201
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,760
and we can look in any account

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,980
and we can see who's partnered with us.

203
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,130
A lot of it's, you know, hopefully
it's all okay. (chuckles)

204
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,950
But normally it's vendors, SaaS vendors,

205
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,200
people they have relationships
with like Snowflake

206
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,570
where you have database
connections and things like that.

207
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,510
But you can also from there drill down in

208
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,010
to see the policies.

209
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,430
And so that is something
again, to try to go see

210
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,150
all of that information
the natural way (chuckles)

211
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,260
through a query or whatever.

212
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,400
That's a lot more difficult.

213
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,360
Right here, just from this
console we can really drill down

214
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,660
and if we choose to take
action, you can block it.

215
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,050
So, that takes me then to the regions.

216
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,260
Regions is just like it says,

217
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,840
there's new regions.

218
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,700
AWS brings up good examples like India.

219
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,860
For a long time there's
only one region there.

220
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,210
In the banking you need two.

221
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,380
You know, for DR,

222
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,690
we've always struggled
with that other region.

223
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,857
So, when the regions
come on we can now say,

224
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:33,600
"Hey, this application, does
it actually need to be there?"

225
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,283
So, we can control that that way.

226
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,900
Down at the bottom you'll
see are the services.

227
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,590
So, if you click on wherever
you click on up there,

228
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,110
the numbers across the bottom are

229
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,943
from that service layer

230
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,540
will tell you how many
people are using it.

231
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,100
And you can also drill into
the sensitive permission.

232
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,620
So, this is a thing that
Sonrai has done for us,

233
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,550
which is they have people
all the time working the IAM.

234
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,590
That's a full-time job.

235
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,570
And that's just made it very easy for us.

236
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,700
We don't have to guess now and we take

237
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,200
their sensitive permissions

238
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,790
and you can choose to protect again.

239
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,620
So, the key to all of that

240
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,350
is when you take action in
the far corner up there,

241
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,760
you'll see the deploy button.

242
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,430
And then it'll take you
to see what is staged

243
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,140
and from there you can deploy it,

244
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,561
and I'll let them explain
exactly how that works.

245
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,820
(people chattering)

246
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,830
All right, I'm at 20 minutes.

247
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,448
So, let's just finish up here.

248
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:30,480
(people chattering)

249
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,970
Real quick though, I wanted to point out

250
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,150
the lines of code and the hours saved.

251
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,820
That essentially refers to the fact

252
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,020
that if our policies about
38, 40 lines of per SEP

253
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,090
and we have over a 1000 accounts,

254
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,210
that's lines of code that we
didn't have to copy and paste,

255
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,640
change the information and deploy.

256
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,420
And if I just calculated
an hour per account,

257
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,710
we've saved over a 1000 hours.

258
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,720
So, the numbers are probably
a lot more than that.

259
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,850
But it is a way for
you to look at getting,

260
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,468
how can this tool pay for itself, okay?

261
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:05,468
(people chattering)

262
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,260
All right, with that, I gotta
go 'cause I'm over the time.

263
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,750
But, (chuckles) thank you everyone.

264
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,160
I'll stick around, you can talk to me.

265
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,304
Sonrai guys are at Booth
435. I appreciate your time.

266
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:20,471
(audience applauding)
