  "abstract": "Physical AI is changing robotics by enabling systems to interact intelligently with the world, but development requires extensive compute, simulation, and deployment resources. This session shows how NVIDIA’s Isaac platform combined with AWS allows end-to-end implementation: robots are trained and validated in high-fidelity simulated environments using Amazon EC2 GPU instances, with large-scale workloads orchestrated via AWS Batch and Isaac Lab for parallel experiments. Attendees learn how this integrated solution accelerates development and deployment, offering safe, scalable, and cost-efficient workflows for advanced robotics applications. This presentation is brought to you by NVIDIA, an AWS Partner.",
