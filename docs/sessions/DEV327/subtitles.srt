1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,320
- And welcome to today's session.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,040
And you know now agentic AI has emerged

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,380
as one of the most exciting topics

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,010
in today's gen AI landscape.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,490
So as forward-thinking developers,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,460
I know you are looking to go beyond

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,460
just understanding the series
or concepts or terminologies.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,530
So you want to see the real scenarios

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,050
or real innovations in action

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,670
and then how to, maybe, you want to build

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,690
your own AI agents
applications from ground up.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,370
So that's exactly what we
are here to deliver today.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,170
I'm Haowen Huang, a
Senior Developer Advocate

14
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,400
at AWS based in Hong Kong.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,270
And I'm honored to join
my colleague, Jacky Wu,

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,800
who is Senior Solutions
Architect, also from Hong Kong.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,850
Yeah, take it, yeah.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,840
- Thanks for joining the session.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,220
Hope you enjoy it.

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,980
- So today, we will take you through

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,060
how to build agentic AI on AWS in practice

22
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:15,930
using Nova Act and Strands Agents.

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,930
So, we will bring you a
lot of demonstrations.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,490
From my side,

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,410
I will put two hands-on
demonstrations of AI agents.

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,150
Yes, one is interactive
weather information agent

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,200
and the other is educational
video creation agent.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,713
And Jacky will bring more multi-agents,

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,083
he will use in some
financial scenarios later.

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,090
And here is our agenda for today.

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,790
First, we will start
with some fundamentals,

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,240
like explore how AI agents concept

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,460
to ensure we're all on the same page.

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,320
Then next, I will provide a
hands-on demonstration showing

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,340
you how to build a real agent application

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,620
for Hong Kong weather information

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,370
using MCP and the Nova Act.

38
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,584
Then, we will dive into
real-world applications

39
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:22,650
by exploring how to build enterprise

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,370
agentic AI solutions from the ground up,

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,320
using open-source Strands Agents.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,900
You know, open-source Strands Agents

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,290
is AWS' recently opened contribution

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,720
to the open-source communities.

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,320
Following up, Jacky will
bring some valuable experience

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,783
from the capital markets.

47
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:46,860
He will introduce you to four multi-agent

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,440
collaboration patterns and tools

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,340
with open source Strands Agents SDK.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,250
And he will also
demonstrate these concepts

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,060
through two practical financial use cases.

52
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,060
And finally, we will wrap up
with a comprehensive overview

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,623
of AWS' complete agentic AI portfolio.

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,740
Let's begin by examining the future trend

55
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,840
of agentic AI first.

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,280
So, if we dive deep into the
evolution of generative AI,

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,330
you will see that it has
followed a clear progression,

58
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,330
so each phase brings new priorities

59
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,140
and challenges for business.

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,897
So, on the left, you'll see the low agency

61
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:41,100
and the more human oversight
which are rule-based

62
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,070
and require high human oversight.

63
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,880
So, on the right, we
see high agency systems

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,260
and can operate independently

65
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:55,860
and even make some strategic
decisions by themselves,

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,990
by the agent themselves.

67
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,940
But in reality,

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,960
actually we are still at
the very beginning stage

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,150
of the agentic AI.

70
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,200
So, reaching higher agency request,

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
not just about technologies,

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,120
but also maybe some
governance, maybe some trust,

73
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,520
and some organization readiness.

74
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,553
We will dip into that topic later.

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,150
So, although we are still
in the very early stage

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,500
of agentic AI that has a
version of future world

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,210
powered by AI agents.

78
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,260
I would like to recommend
this Sequoia Capital's

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,260
keynote address at AI Ascent
2025 in San Francisco,

80
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,430
which is also referenced here.

81
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,630
So, Sequoia Capital predicts
that future AI systems

82
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,620
will go beyond the current
tool-like attributes

83
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,620
and evolve into autonomously
operating intelligent agents.

84
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,530
So, these intelligent
agents will have capability

85
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,660
for reasoning, for planning,

86
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,660
for collaboration, and
high autonomous operation.

87
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,330
So the most striking aspect of
Sequoia Capital's prediction,

88
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,940
on the right is their vision
for the 2030s agent economy.

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,730
It will operate like a
global neural network,

90
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,760
composed of numerous agent operations

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,180
and forming a interconnected network,

92
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
as illustrated on the right.

93
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,490
So put simply, if in the future,

94
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,270
if the AI agent you designed is adopted

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,783
by the majority people,
for example, in Hong Kong,

96
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,820
you make enough money to buy
a house in Hong Kong, right?

97
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,000
And if the AI agents
you designed are adopted

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,870
by most people worldwide,
then congratulations,

99
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,360
you will have the excellent chance

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,100
to become a very rich man.

101
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,570
So, I think the right is the forecast

102
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,260
of Sequoia Capital for the 2030s.

103
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,270
So it's very important

104
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,270
because I think it'll make
everyone know what we should do,

105
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,303
make every developer know what
we should do in the future.

106
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay, Sequoia Capital also have some bold

107
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,510
prediction in their keynote address.

108
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,250
The upcoming emergence of
the first one-person unicorn,

109
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,170
means a company will be created

110
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,200
and operated by a single individual

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,830
with a valuation of 1
billion U.S. dollars.

112
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,520
So this shift in labor structure

113
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,956
has given rise to entire
new organization models.

114
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:59,190
This means a business that
can be run by a single person

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,270
while he or she can do or perform

116
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,110
all the functional capabilities

117
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,480
in the scale of a complete startup.

118
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,430
So, additionally, if you
look close to the right

119
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,640
for the stochastic mindset,
which is my favorite here.

120
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,690
So the emerging world
of AI agents requires us

121
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,930
to adopt an entire
different way of thinking.

122
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,800
So, I know when we work
with large language models,

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,360
many developers, they
complain that the output

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
are not very accurate or fails to meet

125
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,410
our human being expectations, right?

126
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,870
So, when facing these frustrations,

127
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,330
I would encourage you to consider

128
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,480
a completely different perspective,

129
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,480
perhaps it's our way to connect
with large language models

130
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,810
or connect with AIs lead to adjustment.

131
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,810
So this is why in 2025,

132
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,310
forward-thinking AI
IDE like Kiro, K-I-R-O,

133
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,650
features crucial capabilities,

134
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,370
which is a spec-driven development.

135
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,750
So, this is another topic.

136
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,140
I'm not going to dive deep into it

137
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,083
because my time is limited, but, however,

138
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,140
I hope you understand this.

139
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,010
To succeed in the new era of agentic AI,

140
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,590
you must prepare mentally in areas

141
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,020
you may not well considered,

142
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,020
not only in the technology,
but also in some, maybe,

143
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,140
we'll call some changes
in the organizations

144
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,300
and future organization structure

145
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,663
and your mental frameworks as well.

146
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,730
Okay, so in 2025,

147
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,500
we see that much of the
foundational infrastructure

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,140
for the future world of agentic AI

149
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,390
is already under construction.

150
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,100
For example, communication protocols,

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,510
so during the development of internet,

152
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,040
the TCP-IP protocol laid the foundation

153
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,870
for network interconnections.

154
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,670
So, similarly, in the
emergence of the agentic AI.

155
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,103
AI agents also require interoperability,

156
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,020
both with their own tools
and also they want to connect

157
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,150
with other AI agents as well.

158
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,890
So some emergence such as MCP and A2A

159
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,590
are addressing these challenges.

160
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,590
So here, I am not going to
dive deep into MCP and A2A,

161
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,660
but what I want to focus is now AWS

162
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,570
is actively participating
in the Strands communities

163
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,290
for both MCP and A2A projects

164
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,190
to contribute Amazon's
decades of experience

165
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,190
in distributing systems and to enhance

166
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,903
these future protocols.

167
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,230
So this is the complete
AWS agentic AI portfolio

168
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,300
comprised of comprehensive architecture

169
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,260
with some supporting services.

170
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,630
So from the bottom to the top,

171
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,470
you will see these services are
organized into three layers,

172
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,293
infra layers, the AI the agent,

173
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,240
software layers and
the application layers.

174
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,240
And each layer contains more
specific service categories.

175
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,700
And today, we will focus on
the AI and agent development,

176
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,420
software and services.

177
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,830
And for the SDKs, for agents part,

178
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,050
Nova Act and Strands Agents.

179
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,050
And Jacky will dive deep into more detail

180
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,170
or more scenarios into these
SDKs for agents part as well.

181
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,110
Yes, we have discussed extensively

182
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,720
for the future of agentic AI.

183
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,720
So, next, I will showcase
practical agentic AI applications

184
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,550
that automatically retrieve

185
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,210
local weather information in Hong Kong.

186
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,103
But I think, since this,

187
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,510
maybe you just need to change the URL,

188
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,360
you can make these agentic AI applications

189
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,663
easy to use in your country as well.

190
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,060
So, here's a practical AI agent scenario

191
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,760
to demonstrate the local
weather application development

192
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,780
using the MCP protocol, Amazon Nova Act,

193
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,630
and the Hong Kong Observatory website.

194
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's play the video first.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Yes.

196
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,480
Yeah, in this video demonstration,

197
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,650
we simply provided our agent
built with Amazon Nova Act

198
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,290
with a special website URL,

199
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,847
then we just directed
it to interact with it

200
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,030
using natural language English,

201
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,680
or you can use do it in
Spanish or Chinese as well,

202
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,410
such as what's the current
weather in Hong Kong?

203
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,090
So, next, we will observe that amazement

204
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:29,090
as the agent can begin to
function like a human being,

205
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,190
a web-scraping engineer.

206
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,420
So, it autonomously located
where the information

207
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,560
from the Hong Kong website
and saved a screenshot file

208
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,563
in my computer for verification.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,120
Yes, the screenshot here.

210
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,120
So, if you are a web-scraping engineer,

211
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,000
this video might be somewhat shocking

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,090
because whether you embrace it or not,

213
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,570
the era of agentic AI has arrived.

214
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,950
So, you may want to
prepare for your future

215
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,540
and AWS services like the Nova Act

216
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,263
and later the Strands
Agents and the agent call.

217
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Actually, we announced more
of the agent call features

218
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,510
in the keynote yesterday,

219
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,903
so may help you in the huge transition.

220
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,110
Okay, so you may want to know the detail

221
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,430
about how to implement the AI
agent using Amazon Nova Act.

222
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,023
It's straightforward.

223
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,420
So the left screenshot shows

224
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,180
the Nova Act forecast functions,

225
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,040
which guide the Amazon Nova Act

226
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,580
on which specific web pages to capture

227
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,710
and what actions to perform.

228
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,710
And notably, we directly
use natural language

229
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,670
to assign like the read and extract

230
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,230
the complete nine-days
weather forecast information

231
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,880
visible on this page.

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,833
And we provided the URL,

233
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,450
which is the Hong Kong Observatory website

234
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,890
with the starting page.

235
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,320
And the right screenshot demonstrates

236
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,760
a typical MCP call in the MCP decorator

237
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,447
and the process of running
Nova Act in a separate thread.

238
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,451
The function here is the same.

239
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,703
On the right, we just
run Nova Act forecast.

240
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,550
Yes, if you are interested

241
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,990
in the detail about how
we implement the hook,

242
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,803
the code repo is on the right side, yeah.

243
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,730
So, if you are curious
about the technical details

244
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,600
about how we implemented this AI agent,

245
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,750
you can read two technical blog post

246
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,000
we wrote specifically on this topic.

247
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,180
And the first part of the post

248
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,480
primarily introduces how to independently,

249
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,720
so just design the AI agent application

250
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,280
using Amazon Nova Act.

251
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,150
And the second part
demonstrates how to implement

252
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,150
an AI agent with MCP and Amazon Nova Act.

253
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,173
And if you want use some outside source,

254
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,340
you list maybe your own data.

255
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,250
So, you want to build them together

256
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,860
then you can refer to the part two

257
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,020
or to the second blog post.

258
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,770
You can scan the QR code on
the right to access detail.

259
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,590
Okay, so in the previous example,

260
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,590
we demonstrated how to
rapidly build an AI agent

261
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,860
using Nova Act.

262
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,123
However, I understand
many of the developers,

263
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,300
they won't stop there.

264
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,480
They have even greater ambitions, right?

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Some developers in Hong Kong and China,

266
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,550
they told me they want to
build their own agentic AI

267
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,990
applications from scratch,
and they want to maintain

268
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,890
complete source code level control.

269
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,460
So, they want to control
every line of their code.

270
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,460
So, in such cases,
open-source Strands Agents

271
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,763
can help you to achieve this
goal that I will discuss later.

272
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,350
If you're like me and have spoken

273
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,180
with many pioneer
developers of agentic AI,

274
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,690
you will share my insight into
the numerous challenges here

275
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,160
when the developers want to build

276
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,430
their own custom agent at this moment.

277
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,910
So, on the input side, left,

278
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,060
we need connectors that enable agents

279
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,573
to interact with diverse
enterprise systems.

280
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,660
So that's where the tools and MCP come in,

281
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,930
so they orchestrate access to this input.

282
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,810
So, the agent isn't just
answering questions,

283
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,960
but actually executing workflows,

284
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,960
like maybe booking hotel, maybe
updating some information,

285
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,060
or maybe trigger some processes.

286
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,200
So, in the top sections, we
need another important component

287
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
for building customized
AI agent systems, memory,

288
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,510
including short-term memory
and long-term memory.

289
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,370
So, short-term memory allows the agent

290
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,150
to maintain context within a session.

291
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,030
And the long-term memory enables them

292
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,550
to learn and improve over time.

293
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,560
So on the right side, you have the brain,

294
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,420
the large language models,

295
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,510
but instead of treating
it as a standalone,

296
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,740
so sometimes you need to
extend it to be a reason,

297
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,740
to be a more complex frameworks
using like the React,

298
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,590
like the Reflexion and a chain of thought.

299
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,300
So, these techniques
allow the model to plan,

300
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,060
reflect on the reasoning step-by-step.

301
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,310
And the bottom section shows

302
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,300
we still need to consider
additional elements.

303
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,320
So because every agent needs a persona,

304
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,320
so like a set rules or
instructions that define the agent

305
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,930
is and how it should behave.

306
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,560
And this differentiates an HR agent

307
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,560
from maybe a DevOps agent or
maybe a custom support agent.

308
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,850
And Jacky will also discuss
some specific implementation

309
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,880
of this aspect in detail when you want

310
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,880
to do some multi-agent orchestration.

311
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,120
So finally, we need to
customize all the AI agents

312
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,870
to provide the
observabilities and guardrails

313
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,030
to keep the agent safe,

314
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,400
the budget, and aligned with our goals.

315
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,660
So based on all the custom
needs outlined here,

316
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,140
you may have already
realized that building

317
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,340
a truly functional AI agent
requires substantial work

318
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,460
and maybe potentially over 80%

319
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,080
or even 90% of the effort being unrelated

320
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,523
to your unique business
logic and the processes.

321
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,990
So, you may have questions.

322
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,040
So, how to make AI agent
development more efficient?

323
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,763
That is AWS provides
the framework for you.

324
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,633
Yeah, this is Strands Agents.

325
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,278
So, what is Strands Agents?

326
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,940
Strands Agents is the
Amazon's recent contribution

327
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,760
to the global open-source community.

328
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,970
It's the SDK that enables developers

329
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,180
to build AI agents with minimal code.

330
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,060
And the framework simplified development

331
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,640
by eliminating complex
agent orchestrations

332
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,980
and help us to leverage
state-of-art large language models

333
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,180
to handle planning, channel
sort, tool callings and others.

334
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,970
Next, let me show you how to rapidly build

335
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,380
a complex, real-world
agentic AI application

336
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,393
using the open-source Strands Agent.

337
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,340
Yeah, here's a demo.

338
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,650
So in the second demonstration,

339
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,720
I will showcase the creation

340
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,960
of a mathematic animation using Manim.

341
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,140
So, it's a present library
designed specifically

342
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,783
for high-quality mathematic visualization.

343
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,180
And the Strands Agents
will process a user prompt

344
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,270
and write a precise Manim script

345
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,600
and generate a polished
animation like this

346
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
to demonstrate the powerful capabilities

347
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,590
to combine with Strands Agents
and some Python libraries,

348
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,373
or some open-source projects together.

349
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,240
And let's dive deep
into a detailed analysis

350
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,210
of the core implementation
code for this demo.

351
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,210
It's very straightforward,
so I can show here.

352
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,780
So the initial code segment
imports the agent class

353
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,630
from the Strands module
and MCP client class

354
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,260
for the Strands tools, MCP,

355
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,930
to establish essential components

356
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,540
for a system to utilize agent

357
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,160
and the message control
protocols within the framework.

358
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,000
And, yes, and the following code segment

359
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,270
sets up a connection to a Manim MCP server

360
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,270
using input and output at
the transport mechanism.

361
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,303
Yes.

362
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:23,760
And next, the code establish a connection

363
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,630
for interaction with the Manim MCP server.

364
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,430
It chooses available
tools from the MCP server

365
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:37,430
and using the MCP client and
the agent with their tools

366
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,010
preparing for the upcoming task,

367
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,970
maybe like the chat loop or like that,

368
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,633
or if you want to design
for more other task.

369
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,330
Yeah.

370
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,160
Finally, it's very simple.

371
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,170
It's very important, but it's very simple

372
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,880
if you use Strands Agents.

373
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,750
The code use the agent to
process a natural language prompt

374
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,030
requesting Manim animation.

375
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,970
The prompt is asking for a visualization

376
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,183
of some specific cubic function graph,

377
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,913
functions from X = -3 to X = 3.

378
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,993
This video, let me play it first.

379
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,850
And this video demonstrate
a complete process

380
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,280
of building agentic AI applications

381
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,410
using Strands Agents SDK

382
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,560
to perform mathematic visualization.

383
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,640
So, in VS Studio, two
terminal windows are utilized.

384
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,343
The left one is runs MCP server,

385
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,290
which connect to the Manim MCP server,

386
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,290
while the STDIO transport
and the right terminal

387
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,760
runs MCP client programs,

388
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,393
which launches the window
generation chat interface.

389
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,760
And through this interface,

390
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,420
users can input your
natural language comment.

391
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,240
Like for example, create a Manim scene

392
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,830
that draw cubic functions
from maybe X ranges

393
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,120
in nine seconds.

394
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,440
And after submission,

395
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
the right terminal will
show the agent processing

396
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,153
the natural language request.

397
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,580
And interesting, yes.

398
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,653
When I develop this is,

399
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,363
you see that there is
detecting some issues,

400
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,750
some combination issues
in my local environment.

401
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,110
The agent intelligently
created a simplified version

402
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,780
to complete the task to demonstrate

403
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,833
its adaptive problem-solving capabilities.

404
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,270
And the agent already
successfully completed the task

405
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,940
and provided output summaries.

406
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,960
And the final MP4 video file generated

407
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,080
by the AI agent is here.

408
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,913
Yes.

409
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,760
So now, it's easy, very easy

410
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,720
to design educational videos now, right?

411
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,560
You just need to use some natural language

412
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,390
as an input and the agent
can help you with this.

413
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,345
Yeah, I want to introduce this

414
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,273
because I think it's the future.

415
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,332
The educational AI agent in the future.

416
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:40,920
It's very simple because it's only...

417
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,210
I designed this program
just maybe in 30 minutes.

418
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,510
So, maybe you can use
three days or one week

419
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,113
to make a real enterprise-level AI agent.

420
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,723
Yeah.

421
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,120
Okay, so this completes the whole process

422
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,780
of building an agentic
AI application for this.

423
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,540
So, if you are interested in this case,

424
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,700
you can scan the QR code here.

425
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,400
Left is to re-watch the video

426
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,400
and the right is to get to
access a complete demo code

427
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,093
for these examples.

428
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,730
And this concludes my
presentation for today,

429
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,500
and thank you all for listening.

430
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,755
Next, I will hand over and
the time over to Jacky.

431
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:35,675
Thank you.
- Thank you, Haowen.

432
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:36,508
Thank you.

433
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:37,980
So, I hope you enjoyed so far.

434
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,770
So, thanks, Haowen
introducing about Nova Act

435
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,680
and also about the Strands Agents.

436
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,780
So, first, I do a quick survey.

437
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,273
If you are developer,
raise your hands, please.

438
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,400
Okay, so how many of you use
the VS Code to write the code?

439
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,320
Okay, few of them. That's great.

440
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,050
So, how many of you have already written

441
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,613
the agent by yourself?

442
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,430
Okay, good, good. Still a few of them.

443
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,840
So, to my part, so I introduce myself.

444
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,890
So, this is Jacky.

445
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,870
So, I also come from Hong Kong,

446
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,700
and I am a Solutions Architect,

447
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
mainly servicing the
financial service industries.

448
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,060
And in the coming almost
25 or half an hour,

449
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,403
I will talk about
multi-agent collaborations.

450
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,277
As we are developer, right?

451
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:24,750
So, I'm also a developer.

452
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,973
So people knows nowadays,
you can have the monolithic

453
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:32,520
and you also have the
containerized microservices.

454
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,810
So, why multi-agent?

455
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,310
The concept is very similar.

456
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,870
So, for agent, you can let
lots of actions, tools,

457
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,740
you can let huge monolithic
agents, but why multi-agent?

458
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,970
First, specialization, right?

459
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,730
If you have a specialized agent,

460
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,830
so it'll work in the space for domains,

461
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,510
so it increase precision

462
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,680
and so that you can have
more precise answers.

463
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,990
And all combine those specialized agents,

464
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,943
you can achieve the superior outcome.

465
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,520
Scalability.

466
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,970
So, because you have those
agents and those sub-agents,

467
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,690
so during the work life, you
can add or remove the agents

468
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,090
without impacting the whole system.

469
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,043
So, this is how it can be scalable.

470
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,050
Maintainability.

471
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,703
So, just as a quick survey.

472
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,050
Most of us are developers here
so questions are very simple.

473
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,090
If you debug 100 lines of code,

474
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,540
and another debug 10,000 lines of code,

475
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,180
the difficulty is very,
very different, right?

476
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:35,180
So, with the small agent
it's easier to control,

477
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,240
to monitoring, to debug,
test, all these things.

478
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,010
Finally, about cost, right?

479
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,970
So, as AWS, even in the
yesterday, Matt Garman,

480
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,620
our CEO's keynotes, right?

481
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,180
Choice matters, right?

482
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,450
Because you have the typical model

483
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,490
has three different scenarios, right?

484
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,580
One is about specialization,
the reasoning capacity.

485
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,880
Two is about speed, how
fast can this bounce?

486
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,220
The third one is about cost, right?

487
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,590
How cost efficient it is.

488
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,150
So if you use the multi-agent,

489
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,523
which means for one specific agent,

490
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,120
you can match your task complexity

491
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,830
with the right model, right?

492
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,590
Can be fast, can be very performance,

493
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,003
can be very cost efficient.

494
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,887
In short, I will use the single agent

495
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,230
for specialized, skilled solo work,

496
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,270
while the multi-agent system

497
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,920
is like a well-coordinated team.

498
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,780
As I work in hedge fund before

499
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,810
the monolithic agents is like a trader,

500
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,940
like manage a portfolio all by himself.

501
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,100
But multi-agent is like a team, right?

502
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,530
You can have the analyst
do the market research,

503
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,570
you can have the quants
doing the modeling,

504
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,220
you can have choice, extra choice,

505
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,920
you can have risk manager
manage portfolio risk,

506
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,560
you can have IT maintain the
underlying infrastructure.

507
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,450
So when they can combine together,

508
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,733
they can achieve the superior performance.

509
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,490
But the condition here is
they can work together, right?

510
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,990
So how can they work together?

511
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,520
The patterns.

512
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,680
So Strands Agents can support

513
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,050
multi-agent collaboration patterns, right?

514
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,203
Agents as tools, Swarm, graph, workflow.

515
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,240
And in the coming session,

516
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,880
I will talk about those
patterns one-by-one

517
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,160
and first I will introduce what they are

518
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,140
and then I will use real-life examples

519
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,873
to showcase how the pattern can help you.

520
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,350
Let's start with agent as tools.

521
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,310
For the agent as tools,

522
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,700
you always have a so-called
orchestrator agents.

523
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,040
So which will receive
the user requirements,

524
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,450
understand the intent,

525
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,150
and then it'll call the specialized agent

526
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,090
to perform the specific task.

527
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,230
Take this as example.

528
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,850
Here, we have the orchestrator agents.

529
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,650
When the user sends the requirements

530
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,330
he want to travel a lot, right?

531
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,600
So for example, if I
travel to Las Vegas...

532
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,790
By the way, this is my first time here.

533
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,980
I'm very honored to share
this session with you.

534
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,320
So first the orchestrator agent

535
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,550
will receive the requirements

536
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,280
and then pass to the
research agents, it'll search

537
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,030
where you can play like Antelope Canyon,

538
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,870
all these things and then it'll go pass

539
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,090
to the product recommendation assistant.

540
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,780
So which means the input
of the orchestrator agents

541
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,480
will make it as...

542
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,063
Sorry. The output of research assistant,

543
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,940
the orchestrator agent
will make that input

544
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,563
to the next agent.

545
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,590
Okay, that's the theory.

546
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,050
Now, I will make a real-life example.

547
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,900
In the quantitative hedge fund nowadays,

548
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,180
so the quantitative
methodology is very important,

549
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,730
especially for those quant researchers.

550
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,940
They need to verify their
trading idea very fast.

551
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,650
So when they fail fast,

552
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,470
that means they can find the
right trading strategy faster.

553
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,590
So, for example, they say,
" Is the moving average

554
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,900
crossover a good trading strategy?"

555
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,600
They may have different ideas, right?

556
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,483
So how the agentic AI help them?

557
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:02,250
I come from Hong Kong and I make this demo

558
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,290
with my Hong Kong colleague Charlie Chu.

559
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,740
Yeah. So here is the
sample input you can input,

560
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,037
like the stock that you are
interested in like the Amazon,

561
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,483
okay, backtesting window,

562
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,930
which means you use historical market data

563
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,310
to verify your ideas and
then you can get some metrics

564
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,800
like the profit and the loss,

565
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,890
like the stop ratio

566
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,910
so which means how much risk you take

567
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,590
and how much profit you get.

568
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,230
And then you can also get a buy condition

569
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,570
and sell condition when
you want to buy the stock

570
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,770
or when you wanna sell the stock.

571
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,350
And then you can run the backtest.

572
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,100
And in our sample it will
give the backtest results

573
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,580
how much you make and as well

574
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,500
it will give you suggestions

575
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,470
for your trading strategies,
whether it's good or not,

576
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,330
how to improve the trading strategy,

577
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,583
what's the risk behind and any alert.

578
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,460
So that's sample input output

579
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,640
so you may understand what's
behind this stuff, right?

580
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,590
I think developers or architects,

581
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,330
you like the architecture diagrams.

582
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,130
So here we got the
orchestration agents here

583
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:11,430
which will call different
tools and agents.

584
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,590
So here we've got two tools,

585
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,177
which is market data tools,
another one is backtest tools.

586
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:19,590
And we also got two agents here.

587
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,730
So strategy generation agents
and results summary agents.

588
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,000
And the orchestrator agents,
the quantum research agents

589
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,648
is orchestrator agents
will call the sub-agents.

590
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:31,590
In the coming slides,

591
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,960
I will focus the three components here.

592
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,770
So first I will show you how
to use agent called Gateway

593
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,000
to build the tools and then
it can be used in the agents.

594
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,030
And second one I will show
you the AgentCore Runtime,

595
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,940
how to host the strategy generation agents

596
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,250
and make the agent as a tool

597
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,430
which will be used by the
quant research agents.

598
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,963
Let's start with the tools.

599
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,450
Amazon SageMaker AgentCore Gateway,

600
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,760
it provides an easy and secure way

601
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,400
for developers to build tools for agents.

602
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,760
So you can capture the
API or Lambda functions

603
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,003
for existing services
into MCP compatible tools.

604
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,330
Here, I will use the Lambda function

605
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,430
as a backend Gateway target.

606
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,930
So I store the historical
market data in the S3 table

607
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,830
and then this is the function
I will define the catalog.

608
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,570
After I lock in the catalog,

609
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,910
I can start to search the market data

610
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,653
I will use in the Gateway.

611
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,530
After I define the Lambda function,

612
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,170
I will make the Lambda function

613
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,393
as the target of the Gateway.

614
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,300
I will create a Gateway first.

615
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,677
Okay, it's very simple with
AgentCore starter toolkits.

616
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:49,620
So AgentCore Gateway create Gateway,

617
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,710
you give the name and then in the console

618
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,953
you will find the agent,
the gateway is created.

619
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,840
After the gateway is created,

620
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,923
you will also notice that
inbound identity here,

621
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,160
which is Cognito by default.

622
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,440
So that when your agents orchestrator

623
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,290
tries to call this tool,
you need to authenticate

624
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,090
so you can get a secure environment.

625
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,290
And then as a tool, the
agents will always know

626
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,710
you should define a clear input and output

627
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,720
of the Lambda functions.

628
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,350
That's why here I say the
name is get_market_data, okay?

629
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,540
And then in future when
the quant research agent

630
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,880
tries to call this tool,

631
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,220
it will trigger the tool get_market_data

632
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,683
and you also get the
input parameters here.

633
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:39,930
Now I have the gateway ready there.

634
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,730
So I will make the gateway a tool

635
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,623
to the quant research agents.

636
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,820
First, Haowen just
mentioned like you can call

637
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,570
the tool later to make the tool

638
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,800
and then you can give the
okay to define what it is,

639
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,930
what's the arguments, what's returned.

640
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,440
And then you mentioned, the
gateway will use Cognito

641
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,633
by default to do the authentication.

642
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:09,830
And then I will, after the
Cognito authentication,

643
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,280
I will call the Gateway
using the HTTPS client

644
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,090
and then I am able to get
historical market data

645
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,383
to do my backtesting.

646
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,410
That's about Gateway.

647
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,630
After we define the market data tools

648
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,230
and then we will define
the strategy agents.

649
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,500
And for our agents we will
deploy to AgentCore Runtime.

650
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,220
So AgentCore Runtime provides
a secure and fast way

651
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,910
and specialized tools to host your agents.

652
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,360
Here, I define the
strategy from the Strands,

653
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,830
I import agent and then I
define the instructions,

654
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,010
so it's a trading strategy code generator,

655
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,260
I use the backtrader framework,

656
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,590
So please generate the code for me, okay?

657
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,000
Just give me the Python code

658
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,790
because this code will be executed later.

659
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,710
And then I define, give the name,

660
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,257
give the system prompt,
give the model to use.

661
00:37:04,257 --> 00:37:05,430
And by the way,

662
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:09,780
you can notice that in the
strategy generation agent,

663
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,670
I use the Claude Sonnet
coding capacity, right?

664
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,840
And later you will find

665
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,080
for another agents I use Nova model,

666
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,210
which is good in summarization.

667
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,590
So this is also the benefits

668
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,480
I just talked at the beginning, right?

669
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,990
You can use different language models

670
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,703
for different sub-agents.

671
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,090
And once I have it,

672
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,510
how do I deploy the agent to the runtime?

673
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,700
So first I will form the Bedrock agent,

674
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,580
import the Bedrock AgentCore apps.

675
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,900
So after import apps,

676
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,960
what you need is you give
the app the entry points.

677
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,780
So to specify once the agent is triggered,

678
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,340
which way it will be triggered

679
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,810
and then I have to run, okay?

680
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,513
By default it'll listen to port 8080.

681
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,040
And once the code is ready

682
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,310
I will deploy it to AgentCore Runtime.

683
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,930
It's quite simple actually, right?

684
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,650
For the AgentCore Runtime you
can just use agentcore config

685
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,210
to specify the files and also
the requirement files, right?

686
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,460
You can have the dependents,
lots of dependents,

687
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,040
so that AgentCore Runtime
will install for you

688
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,660
and build a container.

689
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,970
And then AgentCore launch.

690
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,503
So after AgentCore launch,

691
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:29,010
you will get the Runtime
agents in your console

692
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,930
and then you can also check the status,

693
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,360
AgentCore status to check it.

694
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,730
So this is how quickly you can deploy

695
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,170
through the AgentCore, right?

696
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,000
So someone will ask you,
okay, I do not use Python,

697
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,740
I use Java, for example, right?

698
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,510
You can build your own container, right?

699
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,860
So just to comply to the
AgentCore Runtime protocol,

700
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,530
you can bring your own container

701
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,327
to deploy to the AgentCore Runtime.

702
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:57,327
And after that I will make the
agent as a tool, similarly.

703
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,807
So I use the Strands as tool generator

704
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,970
and then generate trading strategies

705
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,770
and I specify the arguments.

706
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,770
So please note here the input,
I'm expecting a JSON file.

707
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,440
So you see the name, the buy
condition, sell condition,

708
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,360
which I just mentioned at
the very beginning, right?

709
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,890
So this is the input.

710
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,330
And then here I use the AgentCore Runtime

711
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,160
to invoke the AgentCore Runtime.

712
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,913
So this is how I make the agent as tools.

713
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,750
So after you define the two tools,

714
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,960
market data tool, you define
the strategy generation agents,

715
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,700
you define Runtime tools,

716
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,000
you define the result summary agents

717
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,460
that come to the quant research agent,

718
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,773
which is the orchestrator agent.

719
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,930
It's quite simple.

720
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,150
From Strands, I will import agents,

721
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,740
you give the six prompts, right?

722
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,300
So for a quant trading strategist,

723
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,820
you will like, okay, get
historical market data,

724
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,430
generate the strategy,
run the Strands code,

725
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,690
analyze the results.

726
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,700
So basically that's the prompts means.

727
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,000
I will not focus on the tools
here because this pattern,

728
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,270
remember is the agent as a tool.

729
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,220
So here I can see I've got the four tools,

730
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,890
fetch the market data, generate strategy,

731
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,040
run backtest, and create result summaries.

732
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,450
So, if the there are something
wrong here, the orchestrator,

733
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,450
the quant research agents will
relearn the generated code.

734
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,943
So let's see a quick demo.

735
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,373
So if you look at this,

736
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:34,080
you will find that I use the
Kiro's CLI to run the command.

737
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,120
So it's perfect for my debugging

738
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,320
because when you write, Kiro
already knows the output

739
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,010
and then it will help
you debug much faster.

740
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:49,010
Okay. I ask the Kiro CLI to
run the quant agent for me.

741
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,470
And here you will use
the tool execute_bash.

742
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,770
And then you here you
can say the JSON file.

743
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,080
So I use, okay, 10-day period

744
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,920
simple moving average close over 30 day

745
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,930
simple moving average.

746
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:08,040
First, the strategy will try
to go to the first tools,

747
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,130
which is generate trading strategies.

748
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,190
And here you can see first the agent

749
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,080
will make the JSON input, right?

750
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,320
Remember, I define the
input as a JSON file.

751
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,480
So you can see it's JSON format

752
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,540
and then it perfectly generated

753
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,310
the crossover strategy for me.

754
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,640
So in the Python file you
can see how it process,

755
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,130
how it generate the trading signals.

756
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,323
Okay, it's finished, six seconds.

757
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,860
After I generate the code,

758
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,270
the agent call the
fetch_market_data via the Gateway.

759
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,080
And here you can see the HTTP
request to the Gateway here.

760
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,970
So the symbol is Amazon,

761
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,640
which I defined at the
very beginning and then,

762
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,170
okay, because I defined one year,

763
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,430
so you can see around
200 data points retrieved

764
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,810
from the Gateway.

765
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:02,130
And the third step it will run
the actual backtest itself.

766
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,830
You can see here you can get a sample data

767
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,500
that I will use in the backtest.

768
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,580
And then because I use
the backtrade framework,

769
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,730
so Cerebro engine is the core component

770
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,500
about backtrade framework.

771
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,140
And then here you can also say I need

772
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,230
to feed the market data into Cerebro

773
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,910
so that you know the market data

774
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,910
and then it will try to
backtest the strategy.

775
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,510
And output, here you can see,
okay, that's the initial value

776
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,290
and then, okay, what's the profit you get

777
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,910
and what's the total return?

778
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,860
And finally, okay, it will try

779
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,500
to create the result summary, okay?

780
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,853
And what it is and how
it needs to be improved.

781
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,720
So here also use AgentCore memory here.

782
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,210
So because I saved the backtest result

783
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,060
in the AgentCore memory
and in the third step,

784
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,520
I will just fetch it from the memory.

785
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,130
So this is how you process it.

786
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,160
And here, for different quants

787
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,080
they may have different intention.

788
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,030
Like here I give the summary,

789
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,809
I give the recommendations,
I give the alerts

790
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,100
and also the key concerns,

791
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,503
how I can improve my trading strategies.

792
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,050
So if you are interested,

793
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,273
so you can scan the live demo here,

794
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,870
to create your own strategy.

795
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,120
Okay, this just for information,

796
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,970
this does not constitute
any investment advice, okay?

797
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,225
So please consult with a
qualified financial analyst.

798
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:32,880
Okay.

799
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,760
So let's talk about agent as tools.

800
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,270
Now the second one I
want to discuss is Swarm.

801
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,690
The Swarm actually is
fundamental different patterns.

802
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,410
In the agents tool, you can
see the orchestrator agents,

803
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,340
while in the Swarm pattern
there's no single boss, okay?

804
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,770
The agents communicate with each other

805
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,103
and collaborate dynamically
to solve the problem.

806
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,400
The Swarm maintains a shared context

807
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,800
so that all agents can access.

808
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,550
So it's about who is in the Swarm system,

809
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,460
what other agents input and output,

810
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,683
what historical interactions.

811
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,100
Let's use this one example, right?

812
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,280
You got the research
agent, creative agent,

813
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,470
critical agents, some large agents.

814
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,950
So I want to write a blog, all the things.

815
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,950
So here, first I define

816
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,140
the four different agents here, right?

817
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,910
So one to do the research

818
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,700
and one is to create something.

819
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,980
And then the third one is how to challenge

820
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,210
what you already created.

821
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,920
And finally, I will do the summarize

822
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,273
to give the final results.

823
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,770
And then from the shared multi-agents,

824
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,690
I import Swarm class,

825
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,990
and the Swarm class I
give the four agents.

826
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,710
And that defines the max handoff,

827
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,413
max interactions so that
it won't run infinitely.

828
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,360
And also, I do not want the two agents

829
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,110
can make each other the
ping pong, that loop.

830
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,620
So I have the repetitive
handoff detection window

831
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,030
and also the repetitive
handoff unique agents,

832
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,220
which means in the last agent handoff,

833
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,683
at least three agents should be involved.

834
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,370
So let's see how it works.

835
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:24,900
Yeah, okay, so the task is
please create a blog post,

836
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,150
explain it agentic AI,

837
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,060
and then create summary
for social media blog.

838
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,060
So first it will create a blog
and then a social media post.

839
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,280
Let's see how it works.

840
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,390
First, once the Swarm
receives the request,

841
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,710
it will first call the research agent

842
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,410
because it knows I need to find

843
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,510
what information I can gather, right?

844
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,513
So this a fact, you need research agent.

845
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,830
After research agent found the stuff

846
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,727
and then it will try to call
the creative agent, right?

847
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,920
Because it needs to
create an engaging blog

848
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,350
and it knows, okay, after I create a blog,

849
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,860
I will handoff to the summarizer agent

850
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,953
to create the social media post.

851
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,780
And the interesting happens here.

852
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,780
In the summarize agent,
it'll try to create a post.

853
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:32,810
However, it found that in
order to create a summary,

854
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,450
I see the general
structure of the blog post

855
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,970
from the creative agent's descriptions,

856
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,850
but I need more details to create

857
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,550
an effective social media summary.

858
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,990
So this is the reasoning
from the summarize agent.

859
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,790
In this way, it won't
hand over to the stuff,

860
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,480
it will hand over back
to the creative agent

861
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,030
so that it will feel the content.

862
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,770
And now the creative agent received it,

863
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,420
it will say, okay, now let me create

864
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,270
a comprehensive blog post and then handoff

865
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,190
to the summarize agent again.

866
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,010
And finally, the summarize agent is able

867
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,300
to create the blog and also the post.

868
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,300
And here I can see, okay, there
are total five interactions.

869
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,100
And also for the Strands Agent framework,

870
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,530
we also have the tools, right?

871
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,010
So from Strands tools I
can import a Swarm tool,

872
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,050
and when I define the agents,

873
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,660
I have import a tool as a Swarm

874
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,330
and then in the results,

875
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:42,990
use three agents to
analyze or to do the things

876
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,980
and this agent will spin off
three agents to do the task.

877
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,503
So this is use Swarm as a tool.

878
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,800
Now I discuss about agent as a tool,

879
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,253
Swarm patterns, the third one
I will discuss about graph.

880
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,160
In graph pattern, you can
define the agent relationship

881
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,470
as a graph network.

882
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,890
So each agent is a node
and the edge between them

883
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,820
define the relationship,
define the information flow,

884
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,130
how they can communicate with each other.

885
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,350
So the key advantage of the graph pattern

886
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,580
is predictability and
also the control, right?

887
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,200
In this graph, for example,

888
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,470
the economic department
can only communicate

889
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,950
with the market research
and the financial analyst,

890
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,940
and it's not allowed to
communicate with social analyst

891
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,350
or technical analyst.

892
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,990
So this is how you have the predictability

893
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,273
and full control about information flow.

894
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,770
I would like to use example
the agentic fund manager,

895
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,430
developed by our Korean
colleague, Kang Wan Lee, okay?

896
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,260
So Kang Wan develop this
agentic AI fund manager here.

897
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,210
So maybe it's so complicated,

898
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,330
I will use two specific agents here

899
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,493
to demonstrate the graph here.

900
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,660
So first, it'll about
the portfolio architect

901
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,033
and then about fund manager.

902
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,730
So similarly, always I
define agent first, okay?

903
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,740
So this one I will define

904
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,560
how it'll construct the portfolio

905
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,870
to fulfill the customer requirements.

906
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,450
So here you can get a
prompt, define agents,

907
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,363
I know you should be very
familiar with this now.

908
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,640
And then in the graph we
have the nodes, right?

909
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,320
So I will define the portfolio nodes

910
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:36,390
which will trigger each other

911
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:39,365
to deploy AgentCore, right?

912
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:42,780
So it will call the agent with streaming.

913
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,780
And finally, let's talk about
the fund manager itself.

914
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,550
I use this example to
showcase Strands Agents SDK,

915
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,620
it can work with very generic,

916
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,490
other open source or
popular agentic frameworks.

917
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:02,460
So here you can see I
use the Strands Agent

918
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,290
to work with LangGraph, right?

919
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,160
I know you work with LangChain

920
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,310
and all the other popular frameworks,

921
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,260
for this one, I use a LangChain here

922
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,890
and you can define from LangGraph,
I import the StateGraph,

923
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:19,350
and the StateGraph, I
define the workflow here.

924
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,420
So I add the nodes of financial,

925
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,730
add nodes of the
portfolio, which I define.

926
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,040
I also add nodes of the risk.

927
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,370
And then after I add
nodes, add the edge, okay?

928
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,680
So from the financial to the portfolio,

929
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,880
from the portfolio to risk,
and the risk is the end node.

930
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,730
So this is how I use the graph

931
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,660
to define the nodes and then the edge,

932
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,210
so you can have a full control.

933
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,590
So if you are interested,

934
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,410
you can have the demo
and also the code repo,

935
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,003
developed by Kang Wan Lee.

936
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,710
Okay, so agent as tool, Swarm, graph,

937
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,450
the last one is workflow.

938
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:03,270
As a workflow, it's quite
straightforward for us, right?

939
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:08,220
You can have a very well-defined
sequence of patterns.

940
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,950
Here you can say, okay, I
have the research agents

941
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:14,180
and then analysis agent, and
then finally the report agent.

942
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,930
So here you can say,

943
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:19,740
when I define from Strands
tools, I import workflow.

944
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,500
And in the workflow I
define several tasks.

945
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,320
And in the task I define
the dependency here.

946
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,130
So for example, the task ID trend analysis

947
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,290
will depend on the data extraction.

948
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,200
And then the task report generation

949
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,480
will depend on the trend analysis.

950
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,940
So this is how you define the workflow.

951
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,890
You can also have the priority here

952
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,270
so that if you have multiple sub-agents

953
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,490
they can learn parallel and the priority

954
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,113
will determine which runs first.

955
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,830
So we talk about those four
different patterns, right?

956
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,090
So agents as a tool and all the fourth

957
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:00,780
in this coming five minutes.

958
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,000
So I will give some simple use cases

959
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,160
so that you can apply in your own company

960
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,810
after you leave Las Vegas.

961
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,280
First, agents as tools.

962
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,740
So, for example, customer service chatbot

963
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,120
can be a good example, right?

964
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,170
So when you receive the customer request,

965
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,810
the orchestrator agent can call

966
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:19,440
your technical account manager,

967
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,050
can call your bidding agents,

968
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,550
can call your summarize agents

969
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,133
and then provide output to your customers.

970
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,940
And then the Swarm patterns, right?

971
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,780
For the Swarm patterns,
so those individual agents

972
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,410
interact locally and then produce complex,

973
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,520
emergent behavior without
centralized control.

974
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,050
So here, for example,

975
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:47,010
for the multidisciplinary
incident response,

976
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,570
If you have any instance,

977
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,180
you may have different problems, right?

978
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,030
First, you may think it's
like networking issue, right?

979
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,770
And then you pass to network agent

980
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,510
and then the network
agents will check itself

981
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,550
and no, it's not my problem.

982
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,500
It can be the database problem.

983
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,120
And then they pass to the database agents

984
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,080
and the database agent will
check and then solve it, right?

985
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,940
So here you can see those agents,

986
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,190
they dynamically
communicate with each other.

987
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,910
And graph, as I just mentioned,

988
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,280
graph enables complex communication

989
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,430
while maintaining the
well-controlled information flow.

990
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,040
You can define which agent can communicate

991
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,980
with which agent, so
like the data validation

992
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,720
with error pass, right?

993
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,080
So we can control, okay,
first you will have an agent

994
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,350
to determine, okay, which has a problem,

995
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,700
whether there is no errors

996
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,410
and then is passed to different agents.

997
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,660
One can be the data
validation without error.

998
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,750
Another can be the data
agent with error pass, right?

999
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,863
So this is how you clearly
define the network graph, right?

1000
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,910
And finally, it's about
the workflow, right?

1001
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,500
So the workflow is perfect match.

1002
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,590
I mean, if you have a complex
and repeatable process

1003
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,050
and you want to encapsulate in a single,

1004
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:01,020
reliable and useful tools, right?

1005
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,020
And so, for example, for the
automated data pipelines...

1006
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,910
We do have data engineers here?

1007
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,010
So you have the data extraction,

1008
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,010
you have the ETL, right?

1009
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,420
You will do the data transform, right?

1010
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,120
And then you will load data
into your data warehouse

1011
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,010
or all the things and
then build a pipeline.

1012
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:28,473
So this a perfect match for the workflow.

1013
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,170
So the four patterns
about the Strands Agents

1014
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,270
that you can leverage.

1015
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,830
And now let's quickly
recap what we discussed.

1016
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:45,420
So as Haowen just introduced
about AWS agentic AI portfolio,

1017
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,740
I believe you see this diagram

1018
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,350
lots of times during our event.

1019
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,930
So again, so I would like to welcome you

1020
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,840
to re:Invent and hope
you enjoyed the session.

1021
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,353
So today we focus on Nova
Acts and the Strands Agents.

1022
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,040
And, also we do a quick demo here, right?

1023
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,710
So we demo the weather AI application,

1024
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,450
the Manim video generation,

1025
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,000
and also I and my Hong Kong
colleague, Charlie Chu,

1026
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,980
developed agentic backtesting,

1027
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,050
and my Korean colleague, Kwang Wan Lee,

1028
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,210
developed the agent AI fund manager.

1029
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,070
So please feel free to take a picture here

1030
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,563
and later you can check the code repo,

1031
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,503
check the demo itself.

1032
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:30,990
And finally, we would like
to have your feedback here.

1033
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:35,990
So please open your app
and give us your feedback,

1034
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,040
and your feedback is
important for us to improve.

1035
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,460
And also, I hope you enjoyed
the last of the event.

1036
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,130
Thanks for coming and I thank
you for coming to our session.

1037
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,102
Have a great day.

1038
00:55:48,102 --> 00:55:50,894
(audience applauding)
