1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,380
- [Kevin] I'm Kevin Carlson,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,600
part of the Worldwide Quick Suite team.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,920
I'm joined by Mary Reese

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,660
from Enterprise Engineering.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,220
And Sujit Narapareddy

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,320
from our sales operations team.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,820
And we're very excited
to talk to you today

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,580
about how Amazon is using Quick Suite.

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,420
We're super excited

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,340
about all the progress
we've made internally,

11
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,825
and how our employees are using it.

12
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,040
We think there's a lot of lessons

13
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,030
that we can share,

14
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,460
that'll be valuable to all of you.

15
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,420
I'm gonna start by giving you

16
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,260
a little bit of background,

17
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,210
and why we think Quick Suite is important,

18
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,103
especially in this day and age.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,590
There's three main forces

20
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,480
that are driving this workflow place

21
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,310
transformation that we're seeing.

22
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,143
The first obviously

23
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:37,800
is the emergence of AI agents, right.

24
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,540
So everybody, every company

25
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,640
is starting to think about how agents work

26
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,570
in their business.

27
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,070
And more importantly, how their people

28
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,783
work with agents to get more done.

29
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,900
The second is, there's now a need

30
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,850
for accelerated decision making.

31
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,400
We think that 15% of decisions,

32
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,960
the day-to-day business decisions

33
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,700
that get made in an organization

34
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,530
are going to happen autonomously

35
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,640
in the next three years.

36
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,343
And that's a major shift
in how we all work.

37
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:04,530
And the rise of these two things,

38
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,300
is pushing us toward more pressure

39
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,880
and competition in our workplace

40
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,230
and with our teams, right.

41
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,300
Individuals that are
taking advantage of agents,

42
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,310
and doing more in an agentic world

43
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,380
are seeing productivity gains,

44
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,960
making it a more competitive place to be.

45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,970
And all of these things
are driving organizations

46
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,893
to make changes in the way they work.

47
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,130
And our employees feel this, right.

48
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,920
There's an AI consumer presence,

49
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,390
where all of our employees

50
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,950
are using AI in their daily lives.

51
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,930
They're exposed to consumer facing tools,

52
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,670
they see this, they use it,

53
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,600
and they have a desire

54
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,400
to take these same sorts of systems

55
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,110
and use them in the workplace.

56
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,390
But the enterprise
still has the same needs

57
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,240
for security, for reliability,

58
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,680
for a trusted environment.

59
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,870
And so we're seeing this employee desire,

60
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,950
and we know it's going to lead

61
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,880
to more productivity

62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,590
when they're able to use new tools

63
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,900
balanced by enterprise's needs

64
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,193
for real governance.

65
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,520
And so there's a lot of challenges

66
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,480
taxing your teams,

67
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,880
in this environment we find ourselves in.

68
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,713
They're pulling data

69
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:04,980
from a variety of different tools.

70
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,850
Many of these tools

71
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,650
have their own agentic environments

72
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,810
for their own natural language chats.

73
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,030
And individuals are having to assemble

74
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,950
all of this information
from different places

75
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,050
to get their job done.

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,510
These routine tasks that people do

77
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,160
are preventing them from achieving

78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,320
higher value work.

79
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,220
Time's wasted.

80
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,585
We know that context switching

81
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:27,300
is a very large source of friction

82
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,740
in the enterprise workplace,

83
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,390
and people are switching context

84
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,550
in order to get the information they need.

85
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,780
And then when they do have to do

86
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,460
a deeper analysis,

87
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,080
they find themselves in a bottleneck.

88
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,550
Because they have to slow down

89
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,620
and ingest all these
different data sources,

90
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,380
and make a decision
usually with some gravity,

91
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,663
and that slows down the
pace of productivity.

92
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,250
So, our vision with Quick Suite is a place

93
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,580
where agentic teammates work side by side

94
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,750
with your employees,

95
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,510
to quickly answer the
questions that people have.

96
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,220
But not just answer questions,

97
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,313
turn those questions and
answers into actions.

98
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,280
So, we introduced Amazon Quick Suite

99
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,380
on October 9th, we launched Quick Suite.

100
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,936
There's been a a number

101
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:13,110
of major announcements since.

102
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,430
We're very excited about it,

103
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,980
and we're using it ourselves at Amazon.

104
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,270
It's a place where you can unify

105
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,430
your data sources to get clear

106
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,670
contextually relevant
answers to your questions.

107
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,830
You as an individual
can work in Quick Suite,

108
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,760
but you can do it

109
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,370
increasingly alongside Agentic teammates,

110
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,170
that can help you do more and more.

111
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,570
And we think it's a very
intuitive experience.

112
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,920
And an experience that your company

113
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,770
and your employees are going to love.

114
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,490
So, just a quick rundown
of what Quick Suite is.

115
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,200
If we work from the
bottom up in this chart,

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,390
you'll see that Quick Suite aggregates

117
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,010
all of your enterprise data sources

118
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,930
that you need to get your jobs done.

119
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,310
So knowledge bases,

120
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,420
files that individuals

121
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,980
might have access to, and upload.

122
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,960
Maybe they historically stored

123
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,283
in storage somewhere.

124
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,160
And then structured data, from QuickSight.

125
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,800
So, structured data from
your dashboards as well.

126
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,650
We combine this enterprise
knowledge with actions

127
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,200
in first party, third party systems.

128
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,570
And then we augment it,
with World Knowledge

129
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,000
and the ability to search
the web when necessary.

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,220
And all of that forms an underpinning

131
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,830
for what Quick Suite allows you to do.

132
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,663
And then we introduce

133
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,290
this concept called, Spaces.

134
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,270
And what spaces is,

135
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,460
it allows Quick Suite rather than to feel

136
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,130
so enterprise heavy and top down,

137
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,000
we're gonna...

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,650
As an enterprise, we're gonna structure

139
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,210
knowledge sources and and force you

140
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,860
to use those in rigid way.

141
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,530
Spaces allows teams and individuals

142
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,180
to craft their own environments,

143
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,000
where they can take agentic
actions as they work.

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,990
In the middle, here we do this

145
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,370
with all the same things

146
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,800
you've come to love about AWS.

147
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
You know, governance, guardrails

148
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,340
or responsible AI perspective.

149
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,110
The ability to have some adherence

150
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,280
to regulatory compliance,

151
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,020
depending on the industry.

152
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,853
And then we overlay

153
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:55,620
five key capabilities on top of this.

154
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,200
So chat agents, the ability to converse

155
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,930
in natural language to get things done.

156
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,480
A specific agent targeted at research.

157
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,890
So we can do deep research

158
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,540
into complicated business problems,

159
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,980
that require you to aggregate

160
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,680
lots of different data into one answer.

161
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,750
QuickSight the structured data environment

162
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,160
that has all of your BI

163
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,680
and generative BI capabilities.

164
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,000
Flows, which is a lightweight

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
automation framework

166
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,940
designed for teams and individuals

167
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,500
to agenetically automate

168
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,210
the things they do every day.

169
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,260
And then Quick Automate,

170
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,730
which is a more heavyweight

171
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,140
automation environment

172
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,720
designed for enterprise grade automations.

173
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,273
All of that comes together
to form Quick Suite.

174
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,330
It's built on top of an index, right.

175
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,580
So we bring the structure,
the unstructured,

176
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,170
all that information together,

177
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,510
in a place where we can
look at it uniformly.

178
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,150
That's been a challenge in generative AI.

179
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,860
And now with Agentic workflows,

180
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,110
we need to have a
consolidated underpinning,

181
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,460
where we can make really good decisions

182
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,560
based on all of the organizational data

183
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,673
that matters to us.

184
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,290
So Quick Suite unites teams and agents.

185
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,250
And if you wanna create

186
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,900
a Custom chat agent in Quick Suite,

187
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,733
you don't need to be

188
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,120
a software developer to do it.

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,830
You simply use natural language.

190
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,360
You describe the needs of your team,

191
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,220
what you'd like this agent to do.

192
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,990
You can connect it to relevant data sets

193
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,140
that you've uploaded to
get context rich answers.

194
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,430
And Quick Suite will even give you

195
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,950
recommendations on how
to improve that agent

196
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,360
to make it better at the thing

197
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,060
you're designing it to accomplish.

198
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,210
I talked about spaces.

199
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,920
Once you've built an agent in Quick Suite,

200
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,720
you can collaborate with your teammates

201
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,610
in a construct called a Space.

202
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,740
Spaces allow you to build a hub,

203
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,330
where the knowledge that's really relevant

204
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,910
to your team coexists
along with the agents

205
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,530
that your team is going to use.

206
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,120
You can upload specific documents.

207
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,650
Maybe it's project based.

208
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,000
Maybe it's team based,

209
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,950
in order to fit that current mission.

210
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,090
And then you can build agents

211
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,130
that work against only that space.

212
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,430
So they have very
contextually relevant answers

213
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,080
based on information, that's, you know,

214
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
current to your team.

215
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,510
One of the challenges, of course,

216
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,880
in organizational agentic AI,

217
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,230
is there is a lot of data.

218
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,610
And so the idea of a space,

219
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,900
allows teams to really hone in

220
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,300
on what's important to them.

221
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,840
Just to dive deeper on
a few of the features

222
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,640
inside Quick Suite,

223
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,050
QuickSight, which you may be familiar

224
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,340
with, hasn't gone anywhere.

225
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,860
It's become a feature inside Quick Suite.

226
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,870
And so all of the structured analyses

227
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,010
that you're used to doing,

228
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,360
interacting with dashboards,

229
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,310
chatting with those dashboards,

230
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,810
using natural language to create

231
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,670
new artifacts off those dashboards,

232
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,170
building data stories,

233
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,540
that all exists in Quick Suite.

234
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,390
And it exists in a very seamless way.

235
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,030
I talked about Quick Research.

236
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,140
Quick research is a place

237
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,973
where you can tackle

238
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,930
those really time intensive tasks.

239
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,550
You can leverage your data,

240
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,810
your organizational data

241
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,970
that you've added into Quick Suite.

242
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,220
You can leverage private third party data.

243
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,600
We recently announced some interesting

244
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,710
third party connections

245
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,210
that allow you to bring

246
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,700
private data sets to
augment your research.

247
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,400
And you can use data from
the internet as well.

248
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,390
And you can combine those

249
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,970
to do a very intensive research project,

250
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,400
that might consider 20
or 30 or 40 sources.

251
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,450
And you can do that in, you know,

252
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,713
as little as 30 minutes.

253
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,130
Quick Flows is the automation engine

254
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,690
that sits inside Quick Suite,

255
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,770
and allows you to connect

256
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,540
all of these tools together.

257
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,950
So you can save time and energy

258
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,990
by automating repetitive tasks.

259
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,340
You create a flow in the same way

260
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,050
that you might have created an agent.

261
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,760
You give a natural language description

262
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,440
about what you're trying to achieve.

263
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,690
Quick Suite will interpret
that description.

264
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,760
It'll look at the things
you have access to.

265
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,720
So, you might have access

266
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,880
to certain data sources, certain spaces

267
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,770
that you or your team have configured.

268
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,320
Certain actions in third party systems.

269
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,060
And Quick Suite will build a flow

270
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,560
that allows you to execute a process.

271
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,810
You'll see some examples
of that later today.

272
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,950
So Amazon Quick Suite kind of in summary

273
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,740
for this introductory section.

274
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,510
Agentic Teammates, a place where you

275
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,950
and those teammates work together.

276
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,940
Those teammates of course,

277
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,640
are going to get more and
more capable over time.

278
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,920
Instantly move from answers to actions

279
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,420
in a seamless way.

280
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,040
And do that in an enterprise grade

281
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,383
secure and governed and reliable place.

282
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,010
Alright, so we know that even though

283
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,930
there are tools like this in existence,

284
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,640
it's very hard to scale.

285
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,380
And I think when I met with customers,

286
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,990
I often would say, well
2025 was, you know,

287
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,640
or 2024 was the year of the pilot,

288
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,200
and 2025 is definitely

289
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
gonna be the year of production.

290
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,310
But the reality is it's still very hard.

291
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,500
And 88% of all AI pilots

292
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,530
are still failing to reach production.

293
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,500
And 72% of our C-suite leaders

294
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,430
would say that their company

295
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,560
has faced some challenge

296
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,040
in implementing AI and adopting AI.

297
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
This is just the reality
of where we are today.

298
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,280
And at Amazon, we face
this just like all of you.

299
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,140
We are a very peculiar culture.

300
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,032
That's a word we like to use

301
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:45,865
to describe ourselves.

302
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:48,120
We have millions of employees worldwide.

303
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,310
We have many, many different organizations

304
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,310
inside of Amazon that
operate very independently.

305
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,440
We have lots and lots of
different job functions.

306
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,630
And it's a very complex environment

307
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,190
in which to implement AI.

308
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,780
And we feel a lot of the same challenges

309
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,613
that you feel.

310
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,640
Just like every enterprise,

311
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,250
these are some of the
challenges that we face.

312
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,080
So, when we implement AI,

313
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,090
it has to be very, very broad.

314
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,530
We want to implement AI in a way

315
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,300
that our all of our organization

316
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,460
can get the most benefit from.

317
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,260
So, we don't wanna
target an individual team

318
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,820
with a very specific product,

319
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,200
that happens a lot in Amazon

320
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,580
due to the creativity of teams,

321
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,140
building things based on the tools

322
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,610
available in AWS.

323
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,750
But what we wanna achieve

324
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,793
is broad organizational adoption.

325
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,560
There's a novelty
associated with AI, right.

326
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,490
And just like you,

327
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,990
we've had to go through the security

328
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,750
and legal processes to get this accepted

329
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,430
in a way that the organization can trust.

330
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,780
And Mary's gonna spend some time talking

331
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,093
about how challenging some of that was.

332
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,900
We also have a lot of disparate data.

333
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,830
We have data silos

334
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,300
just like any other organization.

335
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,160
We have data silos
sitting at the team level,

336
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,990
we have them at the enterprise level.

337
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,300
And in order for Agentic
AI to be effective,

338
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,310
those data silos need to be connected

339
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,840
in a way we can get the right answers

340
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,340
to the questions we're asking.

341
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,490
And finally, we have lots of employees

342
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,570
that are used to doing things

343
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,890
the way they do them.

344
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,850
And we need to implement

345
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,080
some sort of change management

346
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,120
to roll out AI inside the organization.

347
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,270
And that that's a
challenge for us as well.

348
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,240
So, we're excited to tell you,

349
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,420
that Amazonians are using Quick Suite

350
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,920
as their agentic AI teammate.

351
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,090
It's been a journey to get there.

352
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,800
And you're gonna hear about that journey.

353
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,930
But over 40,000 Amazonians

354
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,400
have created custom chat agents

355
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,350
to help them with their job.

356
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,480
Hundreds of thousands of users together

357
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,630
have created over 50,000
quick research queries,

358
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,452
and answered question

359
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:39,285
s that required deep analysis,

360
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,473
and saved lots of time.

361
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,320
And hundreds of thousands of users

362
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,080
have run over 300,000 quick flows.

363
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,210
Which means somebody's built those flows,

364
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,440
and then they've been executed

365
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,780
over 300,000 times.

366
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,700
So, we're starting to see the benefits

367
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,050
of having rolled out Quick Suite

368
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,400
inside the organization.

369
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,143
And Sujit is gonna share,

370
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:00,330
go really deep on one of those stories

371
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,080
and why we're seeing so much value.

372
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,440
So with that, I'd like to bring Mary up,

373
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,110
to talk about how challenging this was,

374
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,280
and how successful it was,

375
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,200
to roll out Quick Suite.

376
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,827
Thanks Mary.

377
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:15,332
- Thank you, Kevin.

378
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm Mary Reese, a senior manager

379
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,020
in principle technical product manager,

380
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,513
working on the enterprise
engineering team.

381
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,400
Enterprise engineering is responsible

382
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,080
for delivering enterprise-wide

383
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,120
productivity tools and services

384
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,800
to the organization,

385
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,990
as well as mechanisms to ensure

386
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,160
secure compliance of
our client device fleet.

387
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,330
And what that means,

388
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,370
is that we deliver in support,

389
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,930
first and third party,

390
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,410
large scale roll-outs across Amazon.

391
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,320
We have over a hundred products

392
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,010
in our service catalog.

393
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,270
And some of those products

394
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,913
have as many as a million users.

395
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:56,880
And so today I'm gonna tell you

396
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,340
about some of the challenges that we had

397
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,090
rolling out Quick Suite
for Amazon internally.

398
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,420
What was in our internal go to market plan

399
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,790
and what best practices we use

400
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,143
to drive engagement.

401
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,130
There were four areas

402
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,353
that we spent a lot of time in,

403
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:18,990
in order to roll out successfully.

404
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,990
The first one was data unification.

405
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,850
Determining what were the most

406
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,490
valuable data sources to enable

407
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,880
for our customers, Amazon employees

408
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,210
when we started providing usage.

409
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,550
The second one was security.

410
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,250
Amazon has a very high security bar,

411
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,810
and there's a number of steps

412
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,250
that we had to go through

413
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,660
to ensure that our product
met that security bar.

414
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,583
Then there was Privacy.

415
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,410
Being a global company,

416
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,840
we work with a lot of work councils,

417
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,300
and we have to ensure that we meet

418
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,890
their requirements in order

419
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,810
to be able to scale this product

420
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,050
across our entire organization.

421
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,690
And of course scalability.

422
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,400
Anytime we wanna roll out

423
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,860
to such a large user community,

424
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180
we wanna make sure

425
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,540
that we can drive excitement, engagement,

426
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,580
and get everybody using a product

427
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,380
that's going to benefit them

428
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,440
in the organization as a whole.

429
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,330
So let's dive a little bit deeper

430
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,850
on each one of these challenges.

431
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,460
Starting with Data Unification.

432
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,720
We needed to determine

433
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,360
what were the most valuable data sources

434
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,950
to connect with Quick Suite

435
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,440
to empower our employees,

436
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,620
that would help them
be the most productive.

437
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,110
And so we did some internal research

438
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,990
on what our employees were searching on.

439
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,230
What they were using
for project management.

440
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,700
And what they were using

441
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,820
to collaborate on document creation

442
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,890
and collaboration.

443
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,770
And by looking at the list of products

444
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,060
that were in use,

445
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,160
we prioritized those products

446
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,430
and came up with 15 different products

447
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,550
that we decided to connect to Quick Suite

448
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,730
so our users could access all that data

449
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,310
right within inside of Quick Suite,

450
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,590
creating a curated knowledge base

451
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,633
for our employees to work with.

452
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,980
Next we have the challenge of security.

453
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,830
Amazon has a very high security bar

454
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,350
for products that are used internally.

455
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,090
And there's a specific process

456
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,453
that we go through, to
gain security approvals.

457
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:34,050
We started by working
with our security partners

458
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,620
to inspect our high level design,

459
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,280
and technical architecture of the product,

460
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,140
as well as threat models.

461
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,880
And we also had to perform

462
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,970
comprehensive penetration testing.

463
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,700
Any findings from the penetration testing

464
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,040
had to be addressed and fixed.

465
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,100
And the testing cycle began again

466
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,230
until we were able to mitigate

467
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,650
all of the risks and get
our security sign off.

468
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,780
Now it doesn't sound like a lot of work

469
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,400
when I phrase it in that way,

470
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,260
but there were a lot of individuals

471
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,090
that did a lot of work

472
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,733
to make it possible to get that approval.

473
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,620
And then of course,
privacy as a global company

474
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,840
is a process to work with

475
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,000
many, many work councils

476
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
across all of the different countries

477
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,650
that Amazon does business in.

478
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,960
To help them understand

479
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,860
the risk that is associated with AI.

480
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,490
We actually held a lot
of educational sessions

481
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,110
with the work councils,

482
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,090
educating them on the difference

483
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,860
between Agentic AI and
large language models.

484
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,950
We also put a lot of emphasis on the fact

485
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,610
that employees privacy was protected.

486
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,700
Because data was de-identified.

487
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,930
And that it wasn't being tracked back

488
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,650
to individual employees.

489
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,335
And then another concern
of our work councils

490
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:05,310
was that the data would
somehow be available

491
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,680
to everybody within Quick Suite.

492
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,520
So we assured them that if an individual

493
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
took a data source and put it in a space

494
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,970
like Kevin described, that data source

495
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,670
would inherit the security settings

496
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,550
of the original owner and not be available

497
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,830
for everyone in Quick Suite.

498
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,820
And so by demystifying
exactly what was happening

499
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,460
with privacy settings in Quick Suite.

500
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,130
We're on a path forward to provide access

501
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,650
to everybody in every country

502
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,663
to be able to use Quick Suite.

503
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,070
And then lastly was our scalability plan.

504
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,780
We worked with our legal team

505
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,550
to update our Amazon's
AI responsibility policy,

506
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,090
and ensure that all
employees had access to it.

507
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,810
And then we took a
data-driven research approach,

508
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,190
to understand all the job
families within Amazon,

509
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,310
and where the opportunities
were in pain points

510
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,800
that we could map to features,

511
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,220
that Quick Suite would
provide to the users,

512
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,340
solving those pain points and integrate

513
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,770
that information into our training.

514
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,230
So, we weren't just scaling AI,

515
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,900
but we were providing
solutions for our users,

516
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,120
so they could immediately get started

517
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,430
and be more effective.

518
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,330
And then we created

519
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,390
a multi-point touchpoint launch plan,

520
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,160
with several different ways

521
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,260
of communicating to employees

522
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,000
what was available to them

523
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,513
for the large scale adoption, that we led.

524
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,890
And so we wanted to generate awareness

525
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,050
and excitement throughout the org.

526
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,480
And we kicked off our plan

527
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,700
by automatically installing

528
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,487
Quick Suite browser extension,

529
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:56,100
and M365 add-ins for Word and Outlook.

530
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,440
So, employees immediately had access

531
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,290
to these tools without doing anything.

532
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,020
Then we launched an email campaign.

533
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,230
We had touchpoints like newsletters.

534
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,450
We launched an internal wiki

535
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,490
with frequently asked questions,

536
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,810
that also included
self-service training, snacks.

537
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,850
Little videos for our employees

538
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,970
to ask questions to and watch,

539
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,890
in case there was something specific

540
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,220
that they were looking
to determine, how to use.

541
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,860
And we also created Slack channels,

542
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,230
where we had individuals assigned

543
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,560
to monitor and respond to questions.

544
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,470
But we found out that a lot of the answers

545
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,430
to the questions,

546
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,170
were actually crowdsourced

547
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,500
by users of Quick Suite themselves.

548
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,950
We conducted dozens of large

549
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,500
live training sessions for users

550
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,440
that we tried to curate to the audience,

551
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,050
and what they would be
using the product for.

552
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,630
And we sent out weekly surveys,

553
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,510
creating a voice of the
customer feedback loop.

554
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,610
So we could incorporate the feedback

555
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,960
that we were getting

556
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,970
into our training materials

557
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,040
and into our communications,

558
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,530
meeting our employees where they are.

559
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,120
And also we created user
community focus groups.

560
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,010
So all those things were part

561
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,140
of how we were going to engage

562
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,790
our user community.

563
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,070
But we needed to start off small.

564
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,150
Because as you know

565
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,370
with a large scale engagement,

566
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,520
you can't just flip it
on like a light switch.

567
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,140
So we gave access to
individual users and AWS,

568
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,210
and enterprise engineering

569
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,240
to our beta version of the product.

570
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,310
And we had a feedback loop

571
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,680
to listen to the voice of the customer

572
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,394
where we took their recommendations

573
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:50,550
or suggestions, or even
maybe found a few bugs

574
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,370
that we could fix before we gained

575
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,110
a hundred percent confidence

576
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,600
that we were ready to scale this project

577
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,793
to all of our knowledge workers.

578
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,370
And so from there, we looked very deeply

579
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,000
at our user research in our personas

580
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,340
and what their pain points were.

581
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,560
And we determined how we could fit

582
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,660
Quick Suites features

583
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,480
with our user persona pain points.

584
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,020
And so we looked into
each vertical at Amazon,

585
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,950
and then we tried

586
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,470
to look at the data horizontally,

587
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,220
and identify what we
consider a force multiplier.

588
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,930
A solution to the problem

589
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,890
that can be used across
the entire organization.

590
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,290
And we based a lot of our training

591
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,360
around this information.

592
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
We identified program status reports

593
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,100
as a force multiplier,

594
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,410
that could drive productivity.

595
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,460
And we were able to do
before and after analysis

596
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,070
to determine how many steps it took

597
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,520
to create a program status report.

598
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,370
The number of times from beginning to end

599
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,610
in our customer, our internal employees

600
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,270
user satisfaction with that process.

601
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,120
We measured our gains in comparison,

602
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,160
and we found out that this was

603
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,610
a very effective force multiplier.

604
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,800
By providing our employees

605
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,450
with data integrations,

606
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,290
that they were able to
create workflows on,

607
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,660
to create status reports.

608
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,980
We saw an improvement
of hours saved per week.

609
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,360
But what we learned is,

610
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,220
it wasn't just a matter

611
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,340
of being able to automate the process

612
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,940
of creating a status report automatically

613
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,880
for a large cross organization

614
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,860
comprehensive report.

615
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,990
By using Agentic AI,

616
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,570
we were also able to gain insights,

617
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,270
and learn things about that report.

618
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,300
So, previously we had been reporting

619
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,920
what we did one week,

620
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,470
and what we were planning
on doing the next week.

621
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,680
Using Quick Suite, we
were able to gain insight

622
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,190
on any work across a large organization

623
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,590
that might be duplicate,

624
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,750
and updates that were missing,

625
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,360
and then also potential risk.

626
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,240
So we were able to elevate the quality

627
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,063
of what we were doing within that.

628
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,260
And so all this to say that the impact

629
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,933
that this product has driven at Amazon,

630
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:26,820
is that hundreds of thousands

631
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,850
of Amazon employees use Quick Suite today,

632
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,423
as their agentic AI teammate.

633
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,110
And next Sujit is going to tell us

634
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,863
about his team's use of
Quick Suite at Amazon.

635
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,270
- Thank you Mary, for making

636
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,430
Quick Suite available across Amazon,

637
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,190
and for the seamless
enterprise wide integration.

638
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,226
Before we jump into how
we use Quick Suite at AWS

639
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,560
and our AWS Insights journey,

640
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,410
let me introduce myself
and my team's mission.

641
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,360
I'm Sujit Narpareddy, head of Analytics

642
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,523
and Insights at AWS Global Sales.

643
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,872
We support AWS sales,

644
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:08,400
marketing and services organization.

645
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,110
A team's vision is to deliver

646
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,270
insights and intelligence

647
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,470
to the right persona at the right time

648
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,093
for data driven decision making.

649
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,410
Let's talk about where this all started.

650
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,600
You know, sometimes
understanding the problem

651
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,160
is half the solution.

652
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,890
So, before diving into
the product details,

653
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,020
let me share the challenges we faced,

654
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,000
because I'm sure many
of you would resonate

655
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,940
to the challenges in
your own organizations.

656
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,010
At AWS, like in any other

657
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,440
large metrics enterprise,

658
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,090
we struggle with what I call

659
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,800
the problem of plenty,

660
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,570
with fragmented data sources

661
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,223
and proliferating dashboards.

662
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,890
Our teams were overly focused

663
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,710
on KPIs rather than trying to address

664
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,930
the core business questions.

665
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,300
Most importantly, we found ourselves

666
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,750
unable to effectively analyze root causes

667
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,033
or delivered truly actionable insights.

668
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,480
These challenges were apparent

669
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,370
during the internal business reviews,

670
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,450
and even more prominent

671
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,430
in the rhythm of the business.

672
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,410
This resulted in poor experience

673
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,020
to our C-Suite leaders, sales managers,

674
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,490
during these reviews.

675
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,110
While we had all the necessary

676
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,330
data points and metrics,

677
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,643
they were fragmented and lacked context.

678
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,740
This is similar to having

679
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,230
all the ingredients to prepare a meal

680
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,790
but with no clear recipe

681
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,563
or labels to make sense of them.

682
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,430
From this business review dilemma,

683
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,040
there's almost two critical questions.

684
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,980
First, how could we transform

685
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
this overwhelming abundance of data

686
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,610
into meaningful insights,

687
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,013
that can actually drive business value?

688
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,030
And second, how could we evolve

689
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,470
beyond the traditional analytics

690
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,230
to leverage AI-first insights?

691
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,450
These weren't just technical challenges.

692
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,010
They were fundamental to improving

693
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,203
how our business leaders make decision.

694
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,920
With Quick Suite, we
found an elegant solution

695
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,390
to both these questions,

696
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,040
which I'll walk you through next.

697
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,120
To answer these questions,

698
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,940
we developed a three-tiered approach.

699
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,840
Rather than throwing

700
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,000
more and more dashboards at the problem,

701
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,130
we needed a structured approach,

702
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,920
that transforms how we think about data.

703
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,600
Think of this as a journey,

704
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,050
from knowing to understanding to acting.

705
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,320
It starts with descriptive analytics.

706
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,780
Answering what is
happening in the business.

707
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,000
It gives us the baseline metrics

708
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,463
and data points, but we didn't stop here.

709
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,980
Moving to the second tier.

710
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,870
Diagnostic Analytics.

711
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,510
This is where we dig
deeper into understanding

712
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,000
why, and where this is happening.

713
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,530
This is crucial because,

714
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,260
it moves us beyond just
supporting the trends,

715
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,230
to actually understanding the root cause.

716
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,660
For example, instead of just seeing

717
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,990
a dip in sales, we can pinpoint exactly

718
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,303
where and why that dip occurred.

719
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:04,522
The final tier, Prescriptive Analytics.

720
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:07,350
This is what sets this framework apart.

721
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,300
It answers the critical question,

722
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,430
how can we take action?

723
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,200
This is where our AI powered insights

724
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,370
truly shine.

725
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,260
Instead of leaving the user

726
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,060
to interpret the data,

727
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,200
the system provides

728
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,390
clear actionable recommendations

729
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,100
based on proven patterns

730
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,200
and predictive analytics.

731
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,850
The ultimate goal here,

732
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,370
isn't just to tell users what's happening,

733
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,653
it's to guide them on
what to do about data.

734
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:38,732
Now, let me show you

735
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:41,040
how we brought this framework to life.

736
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,900
AWS Insights, is our analytics platform,

737
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,470
which facilitates business
reviews within AWS.

738
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,440
This combines traditional
business intelligence

739
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,930
with modern AI capabilities,

740
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,610
providing users flexible ways

741
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,413
to interact with business data.

742
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,530
The two capabilities are,

743
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,513
one, Traditional Analytics,

744
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,310
with Quick Suite Dashboards.

745
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,890
But with a twist, to
embed these dashboards

746
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,330
on a web application.

747
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,180
Making analytics more accessible,

748
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,070
collaborative and actionable

749
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,260
for everyone in your enterprise.

750
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,440
This allowed us to go from CEO to seller,

751
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,631
services to sales and marketing to signal,

752
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,440
all at one place.

753
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,273
Two.

754
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:26,070
Conversation AI with quick chat.

755
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,418
Letting users ask
questions in plain English,

756
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,620
and giving them faster and deeper answers,

757
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,213
all in less than minutes.

758
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,170
Now to put this concepts into action,

759
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,390
and give you a better
visual understanding,

760
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,223
let's watch a short demonstration.

761
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:51,431
- [Narrator] As leaders managing

762
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:53,610
AWS's complex business,
we needed a solution

763
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,170
that could keep pace with our scale

764
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,553
and decision making speed.

765
00:28:57,755 --> 00:28:59,733
AWS Insights is our answer.

766
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,830
A platform that transforms

767
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,870
how we analyze and act
on business insights

768
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,640
across our organization.

769
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,780
We've structured this platform

770
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,730
around how we run our business.

771
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,050
Central Insights mirror

772
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,730
our business review cadences.

773
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,680
While functional and supplemental insights

774
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,630
serve our specialized teams.

775
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,700
This isn't just another set of dashboards,

776
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,440
it's built around our operational rhythm

777
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,655
with context and guardrails

778
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:22,710
embedded at every layer.

779
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,320
For traditional analytics,
three key capabilities

780
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,093
make this powerful for our leaders.

781
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,798
First, Quick Sight Embedding allows us,

782
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:32,753
to have a navigation pain and shortcuts.

783
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,390
Second, seamless context preservation.

784
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,340
As your filters and actions follow you,

785
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,110
eliminating the need to rebuild context

786
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,283
across dashboards.

787
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,280
Third, instant drill downs

788
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,519
from CEO level metrics,

789
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,430
to individual customer performance,

790
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,863
revealing exactly what's
driving anomalies.

791
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,250
For the conversational experience,

792
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,450
our data structure and approach

793
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,590
to knowledge modeling,

794
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,060
allows quick suite chat agents

795
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,250
to understand our business context.

796
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,650
I can ask, provide me a business summary,

797
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,483
and get actionable

798
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:05,280
and contextualized insights immediately.

799
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,330
A summary like this before,

800
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,220
would've required manual requests,

801
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,320
a review across multiple dashboards.

802
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,270
And not to mention the meetings Q and A,

803
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,127
plus the back and forth

804
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,810
to understand all of the unique details.

805
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,910
Sales leaders can now
dive as deep as they want,

806
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,770
with natural language conversations,

807
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,720
that respect not only their permissions,

808
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,960
but also their unique
context and sales strategy.

809
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,120
The chat agent also allows
web search to connect

810
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,160
to external intelligence.

811
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,440
Leaders can ask, analyze industry trends

812
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,300
that may impact our December forecast,

813
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,520
to get web source
insights securely grounded

814
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,560
in our actual business performance.

815
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,550
This platform solves

816
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,290
what we've struggled with for years.

817
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,850
Handling massive data at scale,

818
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,140
while ensuring every leader

819
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,670
works from the same source of truth,

820
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,050
with no more conflicting numbers

821
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,663
across sales, finance, and operations.

822
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,240
This is how we run AWS

823
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,943
at the speed our business
and customers demand.

824
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,250
- As you've seen in the demo,

825
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,200
the dashboards and the AI interactions

826
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,960
work together seamlessly
to deliver insights.

827
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,980
But what you're seeing,

828
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,990
is just the tip of the iceberg.

829
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,880
To create this intuitive experience,

830
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,250
to build a comprehensive foundation

831
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,960
with three key elements.

832
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,060
Now, let me take you behind the scenes

833
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,550
to show you our approach.

834
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,370
First, how we enhance
the traditional insights

835
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,470
to make them more actionable.

836
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,410
Second, how did we prepare the AI engine

837
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,830
to deliver intelligent
and contextual responses?

838
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,144
And third, how we connected everything

839
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:35,977
through Quick Suite,

840
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,220
to create a unified experience.

841
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,320
Let's dive into each of these areas

842
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,363
and see how we work them together.

843
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,173
Let's look into this
problem of proliferation.

844
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,020
When we started, dashboards
existed in silos,

845
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,940
like the example on the screen.

846
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,520
They were duplicate revenue
dashboards by region,

847
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,540
and users access

848
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,730
separate dashboards in isolation.

849
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,740
There was no unified structure

850
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,360
connecting this insights,

851
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,343
leading to the fragmented experience.

852
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,810
So, to address this,

853
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,913
we consolidated all these dashboards.

854
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,480
On a Quick Suite covered web application,

855
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,430
using a book like architecture,

856
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,080
like you're seeing on the screen.

857
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,010
This book like architecture has chapters

858
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,530
representing a specific
function of the business.

859
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,660
Like revenue, customer analytics,

860
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,550
operations and finance.

861
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,570
All of them connected

862
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,150
through a unified software layer.

863
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,427
The book like architecture approach,

864
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:39,810
means that each business

865
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,580
has its own dedicated chapter

866
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,560
with relevant dashboards.

867
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,280
But, they're all interconnected

868
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:48,199
through the common underlying foundational

869
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,470
data and software layer.

870
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,900
This ensures consistency

871
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,630
in insights and user experience.

872
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,580
Quick Suites web application layer,

873
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,440
allowed us to systematically

874
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,780
control the experience.

875
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,150
And also at the same time

876
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,320
provide the flexibility

877
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,213
for builder community to co-develop.

878
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,090
Now let's dive into how we prepared

879
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,260
the AI engine with a five step flywheel

880
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,370
Question to the audience here.

881
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,590
Raise your hands if you've
ever been frustrated

882
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,940
by an agent giving you

883
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,493
irrelevant or incomplete responses.

884
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,169
Quite a few hands raised to yourself.

885
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:33,903
That's exactly what we're trying to solve

886
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:35,820
with knowledge base, with quick agents.

887
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,950
Agents configured on a dashboard

888
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,450
is like a vending machine.

889
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,710
When you push a button,

890
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,080
you exactly get a very specific item.

891
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,440
However, a knowledge base
agent is like a chef.

892
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,490
It has the capability

893
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,080
to create custom solutions

894
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,093
from all the available ingredients.

895
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:54,360
This knowledge base back agents

896
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,773
are far more powerful.

897
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,680
But it requires some initial setup,

898
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,973
and some configuration.

899
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:03,330
We've invested in building
this knowledge base

900
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,520
for our sophisticated architecture,

901
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,240
to ensure it meets our complex use case.

902
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,160
So we began with
centralizing the data stores,

903
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,620
and implementing pre-calculated metrics.

904
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,720
And building evaluation frameworks

905
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,693
with checkpoints to catch
agent hallucinations.

906
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:25,200
These built-in validations
ensure responses

907
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,063
are accurate and reliable.

908
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,820
Our secret ingredient here,

909
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,360
is to maintain business
logic and relationships

910
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,710
through template structure.

911
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:38,463
This uses the much needed
context preservation.

912
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,003
Now moving to the enrichment phase.

913
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:48,030
In an enterprise setting, it's very common

914
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,890
that each department like sales,

915
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,500
marketing, finance, to
traditionally maintain

916
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,210
their own data systems.

917
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,050
When we start, we want agents to give

918
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,490
comprehensive insights.

919
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,010
They're limited by these
artificial boundaries.

920
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,300
So, we implemented

921
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,670
a cross vertical data enrichment

922
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,723
with smart chunking.

923
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:09,442
In case of large data sets,

924
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:11,140
that intelligently segmented

925
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,690
into manageable chunks,

926
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,130
with business relationships

927
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,380
established across departments.

928
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,270
This isn't a one-time setup,

929
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,150
it's a living iterative
enrichment process,

930
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,340
to keep the data base

931
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,536
and the knowledge base current

932
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,798
across all business functions.

933
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:29,550
Quick flows, built in functionality

934
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,960
helps with orchestrating

935
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,003
the entire enrichment process.

936
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:39,330
Now that we have a powerful knowledge base

937
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,550
enriched with cross-functional data,

938
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,690
let me show you something

939
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,223
that's truly game changing.

940
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:47,485
How we move from asking,

941
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:48,960
what happened to understanding

942
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,180
how and why it happened.

943
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,520
Imagine a very common business question.

944
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,130
How is this month's revenue performance?

945
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,620
In the past, the three user roles

946
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,030
that you can see on the screen,

947
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:03,000
let's say executive, sales and finance,

948
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,190
would see the same static answer

949
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,480
on the dashboard.

950
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,210
Today, each receives insights tailored

951
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,860
specifically for their role.

952
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,260
And this magic happens by combining

953
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,570
knowledge base with quick agents,

954
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,350
delivering instant and
personalized intelligence.

955
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,850
While the knowledge base provides

956
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,610
business context and
semantic understanding,

957
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,970
the Quick Agents act as
the intelligent analyst

958
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,800
to perform root cause analysis,

959
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,593
and explaining the why behind the trends.

960
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,520
That's how we are making data intelligence

961
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,360
truly personal and
actionable for every persona.

962
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,460
it's not just about the question,

963
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,833
but it's also about who
is asking the question.

964
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,060
Moving to security phase.

965
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,010
Here's a challenge that we all face.

966
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,050
How do you share sensitive business data

967
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,670
with thousands of users,

968
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,870
while ensuring everyone

969
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,690
only sees what they are supposed to see?

970
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,080
We created a low level

971
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,680
security architecture layer

972
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,500
that handles this problem.

973
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,120
The smart system filters data

974
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,800
based on our user persona

975
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,810
before it leaves the database.

976
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,240
Think of this as your digital bouncer.

977
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,700
Ensuring unauthorized information

978
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,650
never makes it past the database store.

979
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,480
Now that we have secured our data,

980
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,970
let's talk about bringing together

981
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,790
organization weight collective expertise.

982
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,830
Within AWS, different teams

983
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,480
have built specialized agents.

984
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,700
each bringing unique capabilities

985
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,350
from customer success workflows

986
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,450
to financial modeling.

987
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,910
We wanted to leverage
these existing agents,

988
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,130
to enrich our platform without

989
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,020
building them from scratch.

990
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,413
Here's where quick actions
provide a solution.

991
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,320
It acts as a universal translator,

992
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,760
letting these specialized agents

993
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,263
work together securely.

994
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,920
Think of this as an
intelligent orchestrator,

995
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,170
ensuring all our expert systems

996
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,820
speak the same language

997
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,760
while respecting the security boundaries.

998
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,990
With this setup,

999
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,910
we just didn't connect the agents.

1000
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,250
We broke down the walls between the teams,

1001
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,613
and created a truly
collaborative AI ecosystem.

1002
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,150
Let me bring this all together.

1003
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,110
What you're seeing here,

1004
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,460
is the complete architecture

1005
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,003
of AWS Insights, AI
engine with Quick Suite.

1006
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,470
Now let's move on to how do we connect

1007
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,433
with Quick Suite.

1008
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,820
There are three primary
methods to connect,

1009
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,700
depending on the use case.

1010
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,023
For experimentation,

1011
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,033
we can use out of the
box Quick Knowledge Base.

1012
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,940
This is perfect for prototyping,

1013
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,170
testing new ideas,

1014
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,153
and this requires minimal to no coding.

1015
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,850
Two.

1016
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,140
For task automation,

1017
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,840
especially when connecting
multiple applications,

1018
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,120
we can expose business focused tools

1019
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,040
as MCP endpoints to connect

1020
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,930
with Quick Suites Agent.

1021
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,540
This efficiently handles
the routine tasks,

1022
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,740
and is also another out
of the box solution.

1023
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,130
Three.

1024
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,330
For business narratives

1025
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,510
or for any other complex
reasoning use cases.

1026
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,710
Building a knowledge base

1027
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,720
like we've discussed earlier,

1028
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,683
helps and can be connected
via MCP connection.

1029
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,470
Before I wrap up, I want to share

1030
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,060
the critical lessons we learned

1031
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,410
along this journey.

1032
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,260
Because building a five
star culinary experience

1033
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,550
isn't just about having

1034
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,950
the right ingredients and equipment.

1035
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,500
It's about the principles and practices

1036
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,623
to ensure consistent excellence.

1037
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,110
So lesson one.

1038
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,550
Invest in your data.

1039
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,163
Your agent is only as good as your data.

1040
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:01,162
We've learned early that

1041
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:02,940
you can't compensate for poor data

1042
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,683
with a more powerful AI model.

1043
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,893
Two.

1044
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,510
Understand your user and their intent.

1045
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,970
One size fits all insights won't work.

1046
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,910
We need our agents to
understand who's asking,

1047
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,133
not just what they're asking.

1048
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,710
Three.

1049
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,320
Right information beats all information.

1050
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,900
More data doesn't mean better answers.

1051
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,333
So prioritize precision over volume.

1052
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,790
Four.

1053
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,280
Catch errors before deployment.

1054
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,980
Because quality is non-negotiable.

1055
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,140
We implemented Evolution frameworks

1056
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,020
with checkpoints to catch
agent hallucinations

1057
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,880
before they reach customers.

1058
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,980
Built in Validations ensures responses

1059
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,723
are accurate and reliable.

1060
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,010
Now I'll welcome Kevin
back onto the stage,

1061
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,963
to share some other customer examples.

1062
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,960
- Thanks Sujit.

1063
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,890
I love this example,

1064
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,170
because it's weighty, right.

1065
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,060
It shows enterprise grade thinking.

1066
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,550
It doesn't ignore the data preparation.

1067
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,730
It shows how a real enterprise at scale

1068
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,670
can surface something through Quick Suite.

1069
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,770
That takes a lot of
work behind the scenes.

1070
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,050
But then because of
what Quick Suite offers,

1071
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,520
provides a much better experience

1072
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,440
to the people using those tools.

1073
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,970
So, I think it's a great example.

1074
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,220
Not every example is that weighty.

1075
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,350
And so I wanna walk
through some other ways

1076
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,140
that Amazon is benefiting from Quick Suite

1077
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,280
throughout the organization,

1078
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,040
and just share some
other examples for you.

1079
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,870
So our AWS finance team has been

1080
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,510
one of the early adopters of Quick Suite.

1081
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,270
They track a number of deals across

1082
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,980
a lot of disconnected data sources.

1083
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,180
So they use, you know,

1084
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,490
four hours typically
to do a deal analysis.

1085
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,680
They bring data together from a variety

1086
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,630
of disparate systems to do that.

1087
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,500
And what they wanted to do,

1088
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,450
was short circuit that time.

1089
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,100
And so they implemented Quick Suite,

1090
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,130
they built space that
has the knowledge bases

1091
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,060
that they need to bring

1092
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,010
those disparate data sources together.

1093
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,360
And now they see analysis

1094
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,420
going from four hours down to minutes.

1095
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,490
They're running 500 concurrent deals

1096
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,410
at the same time, which is more scale

1097
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,390
than they could achieve before.

1098
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,130
They have implemented real time alerts,

1099
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,480
to be proactive, when things

1100
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,640
are not going the way
they want them to go.

1101
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,473
And the end result here,

1102
00:42:12,473 --> 00:42:14,943
is acceleration of
revenue for the business.

1103
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,580
Our worldwide specialist team,

1104
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,350
that's the team that I'm on.

1105
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,580
You might see the jackets

1106
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,040
with WWSO on them around.

1107
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,990
The worldwide specialist team,

1108
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,880
is a group of experts
that support our field,

1109
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,440
because they have real deep knowledge

1110
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,720
into the services or industries

1111
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,430
that AWS works in.

1112
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,440
And so the challenge there is,

1113
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,610
that there's a lot of fragmented content.

1114
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,790
There's manual artifacts created all over.

1115
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,410
It's very hard to prep for a meeting,

1116
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,600
especially if you're trying to operate

1117
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,667
across a variety of
services that AWS offers.

1118
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:47,500
There's lots of material.

1119
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,860
And so the solution for the WWSO team,

1120
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,260
has been to build a unified data mesh

1121
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,840
that's exposed through Quick Suite.

1122
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,100
It uses MCP, and some of
the connected actions,

1123
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,960
and it basically allows them to automate

1124
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,180
that briefing and preparation process.

1125
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,790
And so they're seeing a 90% reduction

1126
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,890
in time spent to create

1127
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,870
what we would call a sales play.

1128
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,190
Over 10 hours saved a week

1129
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,180
for people that were spending

1130
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,650
a lot of time creating materials

1131
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,540
in advance of meetings.

1132
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,020
We're seeing 75% of the workforce engage

1133
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,270
with those natural
language chat companions,

1134
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,500
in this, you know,

1135
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,630
human plus agent inside Quick Suite.

1136
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,010
The way they work together.

1137
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,160
And actually seeing a much better result

1138
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,410
in terms of coverage of
that source material.

1139
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,560
In supply chain by Amazon,

1140
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,970
the finance team there has also seen

1141
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,620
great value in Quick Suite.

1142
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,450
So there were six legacy companies

1143
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,550
that consolidated to become

1144
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,410
that supply chain organization.

1145
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,790
And that meant there's a lot

1146
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,290
of disparate fragmented systems

1147
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,880
behind the scenes, that they need to use

1148
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,260
to get their work done.

1149
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,760
And so they implemented Quick Suite.

1150
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,250
Again knowledge base space,

1151
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,380
consolidate that information together.

1152
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,730
And now when they build

1153
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,530
strategic finance documents,

1154
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,940
they see an incredible increase

1155
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,290
in their writing velocity,

1156
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,280
because they don't have to go

1157
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,080
to those six individual places

1158
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,760
from six legacy organizations

1159
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,590
to pull information together.

1160
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,870
They've been able to
expand internationally

1161
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,310
in a more efficient way.

1162
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,770
And they can do lots of on demand analysis

1163
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,210
that they didn't have the time

1164
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,953
or bandwidth to complete before.

1165
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,580
The last example is Quick Scribe.

1166
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,630
So as you can imagine,

1167
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,219
when we meet with customers,

1168
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:24,052
and we sit down with you,

1169
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:25,080
we take lots and lots of meeting notes,

1170
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,940
and we have lots and lots of insights

1171
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,620
that we gather, but oftentimes

1172
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,320
those are not aggregated
in a meaningful way.

1173
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,120
And so, a team built something

1174
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,110
called Quick Scribe

1175
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,760
that sits on top of Quick Suite,

1176
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,700
and this allows us to
extract and structure

1177
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,680
all of that unstructured content

1178
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,450
into something that is more meaningful

1179
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,800
for us moving forward.

1180
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,290
So, we can capture
documentation instantly.

1181
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,880
We can start to recognize patterns

1182
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,290
that we couldn't see before.

1183
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,550
And we really have a centralized

1184
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,810
source of intelligence

1185
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,980
from all those conversations

1186
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,300
we have with our customers

1187
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,180
that are so valuable to
us here at at Amazon.

1188
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,040
So there's lots of these examples,

1189
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,240
and our commitment to you,

1190
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,890
is that we are going to do our best

1191
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,750
to share these publicly,

1192
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,040
to make them available,

1193
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,500
because we're learning things every day.

1194
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,670
For myself, you know,

1195
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,040
sitting on the Worldwide Quick Suite team,

1196
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,140
I haven't been able to anticipate

1197
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,880
any of the ways in which the business

1198
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,710
is really getting the most value.

1199
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,210
And so over time as we can,

1200
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,590
we'll document more and more of these,

1201
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,060
and we'll share them publicly.

1202
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,640
We'll try to use our
lessons as an organization,

1203
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,110
to help you in your journey

1204
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,433
as you adopt Quick Suite.

1205
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,940
We have a full packed re-Invent here

1206
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,020
with Quick Suite Sessions.

1207
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,610
There are 25 total sessions.

1208
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,063
There were several yesterday.

1209
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,300
Today there are still a couple more.

1210
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,310
I think there's a Chalk Talk coming up.

1211
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,780
There's a 5:00 PM workshop.

1212
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,550
We encourage you to attend these.

1213
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,980
We have seven sessions on Wednesday.

1214
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,780
Another seven sessions on Thursday.

1215
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,310
So please, you know,

1216
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,990
take a look at the catalog,

1217
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,190
and use this opportunity

1218
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,690
to get to know Quick Suite,

1219
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,680
and what you can do with it.

1220
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,940
There is so much depth

1221
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,900
in each of those functions

1222
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,450
and research and automated flows,

1223
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,350
that it's worth attending

1224
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,750
some of these to learn more.

1225
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,550
Couple of QR codes, I'll leave up here

1226
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,230
for a minute that you can scan.

1227
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,730
We have a Quick Suite community.

1228
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,800
That is a public facing site,

1229
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,510
that has tons and tons of resources.

1230
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,670
It has an engaged community of people

1231
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,860
that contribute and answer questions.

1232
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,750
You can join that Quick Suite community.

1233
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,550
There are demos you can run up there.

1234
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,510
It is our home.

1235
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,530
Our public facing home

1236
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,030
for all things Quick Suite.

1237
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,890
So please take advantage of that.

1238
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,970
And then you can continue

1239
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,700
your learning journey
on AWS Skill builder.

1240
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,200
So as you learn more about...

1241
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,540
Or you desire to learn
more about Agentic AI,

1242
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,910
and how Quick Suite
fits into that picture,

1243
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,790
you can use Skill Builders, a place to go,

1244
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,720
with over a thousand

1245
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,780
free expert led training classes.
