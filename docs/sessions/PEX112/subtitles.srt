1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,950
- Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,540
My name is Seenu Brahmarouthy

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,500
and together, along with
my colleague Leno Piperi

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,690
we're excited to talk to you about

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,003
monetizing agentic AI solutions.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,440
Again, this is a session
designed specifically

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,370
for partners to provide you
some guidance on your journey

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,373
on agentic AI and how to
monetize and drive revenue.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,600
So it's fascinating in terms
of gen AI, how we got here,

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,190
and the different waves of AI
and how we got to agentic AI.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,770
If you think about it, there's
a couple of different waves

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,039
that we've gone through.

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,450
You know, a couple years
ago with Gen AI assistance

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,940
such as Claude and ChatGPT, you know,

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,940
we were able to automate
some of our day-to-day tasks.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,950
And then as we advanced
into Gen AI agents,

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,530
which are powered by much
more powerful advanced models

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,320
with reasoning capabilities,
we are able to, you know,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,810
automate some of the more complex tasks.

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,840
And now as we move into the agentic space

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,770
where everything is much
more fully autonomous,

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,380
we're seeing multi-agent type of systems.

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,200
The definition from AWS

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,130
in terms of what an AI agent is,

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,330
is an autonomous system
that can plan, reason,

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,060
and take action on behalf of a human.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,210
So as you think about where
we are going into the future,

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,030
we believe there will be
billions of agents out there,

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,310
and this is a great
opportunity for partners

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,170
to take advantage of this wave

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,410
and show you some tips and tricks

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,513
in terms of how you can work with AWS.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,900
So you may have heard about
all the different services

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,440
that we've launched,
but just a quick recap.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,680
You know, all the way from applications

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,880
to development tools to
infrastructure that we offer.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,430
We have applications
such as Kiro, Quick Suite

38
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,150
as well as AWS Marketplace,

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,780
which we'll double click
on in this session today.

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,420
We also have development
tools such as Bedrock

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,050
to find your models as
well as Bedrock AgentCore,

42
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,820
which is a building blocks

43
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,000
for building your agents specifically.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,790
And then on the infrastructure
layer we have SageMaker,

45
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,790
which allows you to build
and deploy your own models,

46
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,210
and then finally compute with
cranium chips that we offer,

47
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,773
as well as the GPUs that we
have partnerships with Nvidia.

48
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,410
But just taking a step back

49
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,740
and looking at one
example of an ISV partner,

50
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,090
since this is a partner session

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,720
and a partner, you know,
guidance, you know,

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,270
Druva is one of our ISV partners

53
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,110
in the cloud data security space,

54
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,570
and they had a challenge with their team

55
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,130
in terms of being able to resolve

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,220
all of these security
issues for their customers.

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,310
And the team is getting really overwhelmed

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,770
with the complex number
of security workflows

59
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,240
that they had to resolve.

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,373
So they built a solution called DruAI,

61
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:23,222
which is embedded within
their SaaS application,

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,680
where it's multi-agent system

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,170
where their solution called DruAI

64
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,710
is built on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

65
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,850
and they offer a multi-system
type of an architecture

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,560
where there's data agents,
inside agents, action agents

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,371
that give the ability
for customers to resolve,

68
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,740
and the results show
for the itself, right?

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,950
They're able to resolve
63% of the customer

70
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,930
security issues autonomously.

71
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,760
So just one example of a partner
that is adopted agentic AI

72
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,100
as part of their SaaS solution,

73
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,353
and they're seeing tremendous results.

74
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,490
Now, you know, feel free to take a QR code

75
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,520
to pull up the link here,

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,410
but I wanted to just share, you know,

77
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,130
as a partner going through
the journey of agentic AI

78
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,740
what are some of the product
and go-to market strategies

79
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,770
for you to consider in your journey

80
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,180
to bring agentic capabilities
within your own offerings?

81
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,410
So AWS published a white
paper a couple months ago

82
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,740
called "Rethinking SaaS
in the Agentic Era"

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,650
and really boils down to
four different strategies

84
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,180
that you can think about.

85
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,820
The first one, and both
of those strategies

86
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,550
are dependent based on product
and go to market, right?

87
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,310
With product, you're
thinking about new features,

88
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,340
either new features or
completely new products.

89
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,260
And from a go to market perspective,

90
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,420
it's either your existing customer base

91
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,760
or new customer base
that you're going after.

92
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,390
So let me go one by one
just to kind of share,

93
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,820
you know, at least from a high level.

94
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,340
So the first strategy is
around extending, right?

95
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,630
This is around new users
with existing customer base.

96
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,780
So here you're expanding the
scope of your existing products

97
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,670
with new features and
agentic type of features.

98
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,620
And in this approach, you
can possibly have an upsell

99
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,710
as a strategy and charge a little bit more

100
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,700
as one of your strategies

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,940
as you're extending and bringing
more agentic capabilities.

102
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,890
And then if you look
on the right hand side,

103
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,600
on the far right on top,

104
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,200
it's build, building new products

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,460
and targeting new
customers with new personas

106
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,633
and new markets.

107
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,270
There's definitely some risk involved here

108
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,846
because you're building something

109
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:48,120
a little bit forward thinking,

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
but this is where some
of the opportunity is

111
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,260
in terms of new revenue, right?

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,920
This could be, you know,
a sales agent as a service

113
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,570
or a market agent as a service.

114
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,700
As we move into this agentic space,

115
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,410
you know, you'll start
to see a lot of these

116
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,130
types of offerings from partners.

117
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,980
Now on the bottom left, embed,

118
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,980
this is for new features for
existing customer base, right?

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,720
So you're embedding AI features

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,720
and in this quadrant you're probably not

121
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,860
charging anything extra,

122
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,010
but this could be a really
good retention strategy

123
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,780
if you're in a competitive market

124
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,390
and you wanna make sure
you retain your customer

125
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,220
with more value embedding
and bringing those

126
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,950
agentic capabilities could
be one of the approaches

127
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,820
that you can take.

128
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,283
And then finally, in terms of expanding,

129
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,170
this is new products with
existing customer base, right?

130
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,720
So you can have some
complementary solutions

131
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,270
along with your existing products

132
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,270
where you're still targeting
your existing customer base,

133
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,260
but it can be a additional
revenue stream for you.

134
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,260
So just a quick framework
to kind of think about

135
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,870
how to bring agentic capabilities
within your solution.

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,380
So feel free to take a QR code of that

137
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,410
and then, you know, it
goes into much more detail

138
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,010
on the white paper that we have.

139
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:25,680
Now, once you figure out what
your agentic capabilities are,

140
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,960
like how do you go to market with AWS?

141
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,680
So earlier this year we
launched the AI agents

142
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,790
and tools marketplace in July,

143
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,750
and this is our one stop
shop for customers to find

144
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,990
all of our agentic
offerings from our partners.

145
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,450
And when partners come to AWS Marketplace,

146
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,960
they expect to see
agentic type of offerings.

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,090
And we've categorized our AI agents

148
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,540
and tools section within AWS Marketplace

149
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,940
so they can find them in
three different categories.

150
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,520
And those three different
categories are the first category

151
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,470
being just AI agents.

152
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,440
This is where you can
find some prebuilt agents

153
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,250
or agents that are embedded
into software applications

154
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,920
or even, you know, agent
development platforms

155
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,990
that allow you to build
your own agents, right?

156
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,420
So that's one work stream
of potential solutions

157
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,890
that customers will find.

158
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,050
And then customers are also looking

159
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,790
as they're building their agent workflows,

160
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,140
they're looking for tools.

161
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,300
We have a lot of partners already

162
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,770
listing their MCP servers
on AWS Marketplace.

163
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,170
So that's another route that's possible.

164
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,570
And then finally for consulting partners,

165
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,820
we have many consulting
partners that provide

166
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,840
AI strategy consulting as
well as implementing that.

167
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,080
So all of those offerings get bubbled up

168
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,190
to our customers when they
come to AWS Marketplace

169
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,740
and look in the AI agents
and tools marketplace.

170
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,110
Now there's a lot of benefits associated

171
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,800
with the AI agents and tools
that are in AWS Marketplace.

172
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,680
I'd like to have my
colleague Leno come up here

173
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,600
and talk a little bit about that.

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,980
- Perfect.

175
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,750
Thank you, Seenu.

176
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,670
So this is a partner session.

177
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,870
I want to get a quick poll.

178
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,273
Who here has a listing
in Marketplace today?

179
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,360
Perfect, so a good number of you.

180
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,710
Now, for those that ,
allow me to convince you.

181
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,900
AWS Marketplace is a
curated digital catalog

182
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,390
that makes it really
easy for AWS customers

183
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,770
to find your products, subscribe
and purchase your products,

184
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,773
and then deploy them in the
location that they need them.

185
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,880
Partners that lean into
AWS Marketplace benefit

186
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,550
from deal acceleration from
the procurement efficiency

187
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,920
that they get from AWS Marketplace.

188
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,620
Also, when you sell in AWS Marketplace,

189
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,320
you're aligning with the
broader AWS strategic goals,

190
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,390
so you get to grow with us.

191
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,710
And lastly, partners that
are in AWS Marketplace

192
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,800
get to leverage the vast AWS co-sell,

193
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,513
a network that has global reach.

194
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,110
And now AWS Marketplace
is also the best place

195
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,270
to list your agents and tools.

196
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,323
Let's understand why.

197
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,090
Flexibility is gonna be a theme

198
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,680
that I bring up a few times here.

199
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,790
Marketplace gives you the
flexibility to price your agents

200
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,510
and tools how your customers
want to purchase them.

201
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,730
So we offer usage-based pricing,

202
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,700
and this is great for, really
it's great for all customers,

203
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,620
everyone wants usage-based pricing,

204
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,350
but it's particularly important
for your smaller customers

205
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,610
or one-off developers

206
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,330
that want to kick the
tires on an agent or tool,

207
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,650
pay for what they consume

208
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,630
before they commit to a broader contract.

209
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,000
And the way this works in marketplace

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,030
is that your agent will track that usage

211
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,980
and report it to marketplace,

212
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,430
and then marketplace will
automatically bill the customer

213
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,730
and then disperse payment
directly into your bank account.

214
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,950
We also offer contracts pricing

215
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,080
and with contracts pricing,
this is an obvious favorite

216
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,403
for enterprise customers,

217
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,880
you're able to transact upfront payments

218
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,020
and you can have broad
durations in that contract.

219
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,990
And we make it really easy
to manage your licenses

220
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,660
with that contract by giving
you access to several tools.

221
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,970
So it's easy for you to check
entitlements on contracts

222
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,180
that you purchase, your
customers purchase rather.

223
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,540
And both pricing models are
supported by AWS Marketplace

224
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,160
private offers.

225
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,640
Private offer in marketplace
is an agreement between you

226
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,930
and a customer.

227
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,180
So you can negotiate
terms that are favorable

228
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,250
to both parties and then transact

229
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,590
that directly in AWS Marketplace.

230
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,650
And when you transact through
private offers in marketplace,

231
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,300
you can set up flexible payments

232
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,820
to make it really convenient
for you and your customers

233
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,900
to disperse payments on a schedule

234
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,550
that makes sense for both of you.

235
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,880
Continue on the flexibility.

236
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,680
So AWS Marketplace makes it
easy for you to sell your agents

237
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,680
and tools with a deployment method

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,710
that makes sense for your customers again.

239
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,590
So we offer API based agents.

240
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,130
Here you're hosting the
agent in your own AWS account

241
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,970
and you're giving access to
the customer via an endpoint,

242
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,980
and you can then integrate
into their own systems.

243
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,490
We also offer container-based
agents and tools.

244
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,820
Here you're defining your
agent as a Docker image

245
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,010
that is hosted in AWS Marketplace.

246
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,770
And then when the customer
purchases that product,

247
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,240
they're given access to that image

248
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,710
and they can deploy it in the container

249
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,610
orchestration service of their choice.

250
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,140
And then we also support
professional services

251
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,240
and additional software offerings as well.

252
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,350
So now you can offer your
design implementation services

253
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,020
to complement your agents and tools,

254
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,460
and you can always sell SaaS

255
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,730
that has agentic solutions
embedded in it as well,

256
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,900
the software offerings.

257
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,880
Now, hopefully this is enough

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,820
to pique your interest
in selling your agents

259
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,040
and tools in AWS Marketplace,

260
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,900
but the reason why I
think it's the best place

261
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,460
to sell your agents and tools

262
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,430
is because AWS Marketplace
is tightly integrated

263
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,220
with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

264
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,170
Hopefully by now you've gotten a lot

265
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,413
of great information on
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

266
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,160
This is a quick refresher.

267
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,020
AgentCore is a platform that
allows you to easily develop,

268
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,550
maintain, and operate agents
and tools directly on AWS.

269
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,890
And we think it's how
customers are going to want

270
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,620
to develop the future of
their agentic systems.

271
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,140
And those same customers want access

272
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,500
to partner agents and tools

273
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,270
so that they can make their development

274
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,403
both easier and more productive.

275
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,310
And for the partners,

276
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,620
AgentCore offers a ton of flexibility.

277
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,390
We support multiple frameworks,
all the leading frameworks,

278
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,150
all the foundation models
available on Bedrock

279
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,140
and all the leading protocols

280
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,750
like A2A and MCP.

281
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,963
So your solutions might already
be AgentCore compatible.

282
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,150
When you list your API
listing in marketplace,

283
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,120
you make it that much easier
for customers to connect it

284
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,150
to their solutions with
just a few lines of code.

285
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,280
And the same goes for the
container-based offering.

286
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,130
Let's see how this works in practice.

287
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,650
So it starts with you listing
a product in AWS Marketplace.

288
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,600
In this run through,
I'm gonna show the flow

289
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,543
for both container-based
and API-based listings.

290
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,760
Then you have a buyer that
subscribes to your offerings.

291
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,020
For the container path,

292
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,690
once a buyer subscribes
through marketplace,

293
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,250
they're guided through a
closely controlled workflow

294
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,700
that eventually results in them
deploying an agent directly

295
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,680
in AgentCore runtime.

296
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,150
And AgentCore runtime

297
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,853
is the serverless hosting
environment for AgentCore.

298
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,750
For the API based deployment method.

299
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,140
That same customer is again
guided through marketplace

300
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,210
provided with an endpoint

301
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,820
and the necessary keys
to use that endpoint,

302
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,770
and they get access to your agent,

303
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,080
which is running in
your own seller account.

304
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,960
Now, the buyer will take these agents,

305
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,360
integrate them into their applications

306
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,160
to enhance their own applications

307
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,870
to make it agentic.

308
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,620
As they consume, each agent
is reporting that usage

309
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,780
to AWS Marketplace.

310
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,900
And then marketplace is billing the buyer

311
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,980
and then dispersing payment directly

312
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,990
into your seller account.

313
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,283
So that's the whole flow.

314
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,520
Now I'd like to show you

315
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,130
what this looks like from the
actual customer experience,

316
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,580
just to show visually how
easy it is for a customer

317
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,473
to subscribe to and use an
agent from AWS Marketplace.

318
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,350
So this is an example listing

319
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,310
of a container based
agent in AWS Marketplace.

320
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,350
And here you're seeing
all the various things

321
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,870
that you can show on your detail page.

322
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,580
You can have videos, everything.

323
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,820
With one click, you're sent
into a subscription experience.

324
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,360
Here a customer can view the
various usage costs associated

325
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,420
with this product, terms, conditions,

326
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,310
and they have a few configurations here.

327
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,010
With one click they can subscribe.

328
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,440
In a couple minutes the
system will go through

329
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,080
and they click a button
to launch that agent.

330
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,963
Now they select Bedrock
AgentCore as a deployment method.

331
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,370
They're given some instructions
for what they'll need to do

332
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,680
to make the most use out of that agent,

333
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,320
but they have a one click button there

334
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,643
to actually deploy that
agent directly in AgentCore.

335
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,990
And now you have an
endpoint that's ready to use

336
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,030
and integrate directly into
your agentic system solutions.

337
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,130
So that could be your product right there.

338
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,550
To close off I want to give
you access to some resources

339
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,220
that will help guide you
through your next steps.

340
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,528
If you're interested in listing
in marketplace in general,

341
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:03,930
you can find everything
over in our seller guide

342
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,370
and it'll point you all the resources

343
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,330
for all the various products

344
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,250
that you can have in marketplace.

345
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,010
Also, please do take
the time to explore more

346
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,190
and learn about Bedrock
AgentCore if you haven't already.

347
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,400
And lastly, I'll invite
you to learn more about

348
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,220
joining the AWS Generative AI Competency.

349
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,950
It's a new competency
for the partner network

350
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,140
and we think you're gonna
be really excited about it.

351
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Thank you, everyone.
