1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:03,349
Let's go ahead and get started. Thanks everybody for being

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:04,849
here. Hope everyone's having a

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,459
great reinvent. Uh, today we're gonna be

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:09,608
talking about one of the most exciting

5
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:12,130
evolutions in online gaming. It's the

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,538
migration of EA's Apex Legends

7
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:15,329
to Amazon

8
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:18,350
Gamelift servers. To be honest with you, this is really more

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:18,879
than

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,350
a migration story. It's a story about

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,658
the motivations, the challenges, the learnings,

12
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:26,109
and the solutions that really drove the transformation.

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,679
The hope is that um

14
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,048
you'll learn a little bit more about game

15
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,490
with servers and

16
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,889
what we really see here at AWS as

17
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:36,929
a shift in how multiplayer games are built

18
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:37,810
and scale.

19
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,529
Uh, quick introduction, my name's Trevor Moore. I lead the

20
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:42,789
relationship between Electronic Arts

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,609
and EEA.

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,298
Um, the real stars of the show, excuse

23
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,380
me, Electronic Arts and AWS, the real stars of the

24
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,719
show are the folks on stage with me,

25
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,240
uh, Tom Penrose, Chief Online Service

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,618
Officer for Code Wizards,

27
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,069
and Jared Cugno,

28
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,509
uh, head of technology for EA Apex

29
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,789
Legends. Quick

30
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,868
review of the agenda. So we're gonna start off today by giving

31
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:04,290
just some context to the relationship between

32
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,469
um AWS and EA.

33
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,150
We'll jump into the evolution of Apex Legends.

34
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:11,448
We'll give a little bit of a deep dive into

35
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,189
multiplayer games and the challenges involved with operating

36
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,088
them at scale.

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,709
Um, we'll chat more about G of servers and

38
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:18,689
some key benefits there,

39
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,469
and then we'll highlight the partnership with Code Wizards

40
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,870
and, uh, what good looks like when migrating

41
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,870
a live service game from one platform to

42
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,400
another. Wonderful.

43
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,760
So let's start off with a little bit of

44
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,308
background with, um, EA and electronica,

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,379
um, EA and AWS. How many times am I gonna do that?

46
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,180
Um,

47
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,500
it's a 10+ year relationship. At its core,

48
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,019
our relationship with EA really revolves around

49
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,558
three key pillars.

50
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,278
The first is it's a strategic partnership.

51
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,480
So EA is one of

52
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,558
a small handful of customers here

53
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,079
at AWS that we call strategic.

54
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:54,109
Obviously there's a little bit of a financial

55
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,409
aspect involved there, but

56
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,948
more importantly, EA plays a significant

57
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,049
role when it comes to how

58
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,948
AWS builds products and services, whether

59
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,109
it's a new region or

60
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,528
an offering like Gamelift. EA's voice

61
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:08,129
is definitely heard on

62
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,449
the AWS roadmap.

63
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,750
The second is innovation.

64
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,139
Something that we often talk about

65
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,278
with EA is

66
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:17,179
regardless of your role or title,

67
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,819
AWS is the platform for

68
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,558
innovation.

69
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,058
Um, moving to AWS, it's, it's not just

70
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,159
about saving money or

71
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,159
scaling up for a big launch, which we do

72
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,300
those things very well,

73
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,929
um, but it's about having the building blocks

74
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:31,558
to

75
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:34,050
stand up a net new business or

76
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,088
concept from scratch in days

77
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,520
or weeks as opposed to years.

78
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,618
Lastly is the player

79
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,639
experience. This is

80
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,099
a non-negotiable at Amazon we

81
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,639
talk a lot about being

82
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,080
customer obsessed.

83
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,659
At EA it's all about being player obsessed. So

84
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,979
you know, whether it's a POC

85
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,360
or a production ready workload.

86
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:57,849
Any conversation, any decision, any

87
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,569
idea always starts with the player in mind.

88
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,939
Um,

89
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,330
so with that said, I think, um, just to kind

90
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,368
of tie this all together

91
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,409
here a little bit, I think it's really important to understand how

92
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,338
EA operates as a business,

93
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,229
you know, they have all of these studios all over the world that make

94
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,710
amazing IP like FC and Madden,

95
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,569
Apex, Battlefield.

96
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,750
These studios, they all have the ability

97
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,379
to

98
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,038
pick and choose whatever technology they think

99
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,439
is best for their team. Oftentimes that is AWS,

100
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:26,409
but not always.

101
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,000
So generally speaking, EA operates

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,969
like a federation.

103
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,639
They're associated, but they don't always,

104
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,538
they're not always unified when it comes to technology.

105
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,588
On top of that, as we all know,

106
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,409
technology becomes outdated

107
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,729
fairly quickly,

108
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,479
um, I think which was one of the challenges I think that

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,649
Respawn was starting to face as they're operating this

110
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,149
super successful live service game at

111
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:47,808
scale,

112
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,588
um, but before we dive too deep

113
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,710
into the technologies and kind of the solutions

114
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,129
here, let's talk a little bit more about

115
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,050
Apex themselves, um.

116
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,229
If you're in this room, you're probably likely

117
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,508
familiar with Respawn.

118
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:03,389
Uh, it's the studio behind Titanfall, Apex Legends.

119
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,270
They were acquired by EA back in 2017.

120
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,169
The team was mostly made up of

121
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,750
ex- Call of Duty, Activision guys, a

122
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,110
lot of AAA legends, uh, super

123
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,139
deep understanding,

124
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,709
and really a proven ability to build

125
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,850
first-person shooter games.

126
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,750
Fast forward to 2019.

127
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,988
Apex Legends launches.

128
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,449
It was a really

129
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:26,889
interesting event.

130
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,428
The game dropped out of nowhere. There was no marketing.

131
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,988
There was no nothing, but it just absolutely

132
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,649
took off. I think it went from

133
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,069
0 to 2 million players within the

134
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,369
1st 24 hours.

135
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:41,139
Within the first month it reached 50 million players.

136
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,269
It's done well over $2 billion in

137
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,879
revenue for EA.

138
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,428
Apex Legends itself is a

139
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:48,670
battle royale style game.

140
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,230
It's really movement.

141
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,059
Based high twitch latency

142
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,278
sensitive, it's a live service game as

143
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:56,199
we all know, so

144
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,459
a lot of new content,

145
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,899
uh, new seasons dropping every 3 months.

146
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,028
If you know anything about Apex as well, um,

147
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,608
you know they have a very passionate fan base, right?

148
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,528
Um,

149
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,119
certainly a community that's not afraid to voice their

150
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:09,920
opinion, which,

151
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,959
you know, we all love to see, but, um.

152
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,459
I think what we observed around, you know, a couple

153
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,579
of years back and I think what was happening with Respawn and really

154
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,608
the expectations of

155
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,079
of the players was

156
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,420
it was starting to evolve and cloud technology

157
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,459
around this time, a few years back was

158
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,738
was changing. Game server hosting was starting to change

159
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:26,920
around that time as well.

160
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,199
Um, I recall sitting down.

161
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,278
I think it was late 2023 with

162
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:33,579
Jared in LA.

163
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,488
It was very clear that Respawn was starting to look at

164
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:38,889
different hosting options, right?

165
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:40,798
Yes, they wanted to

166
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
save on costs, but there were other kind of

167
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,980
key areas that they wanted to explore as well.

168
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,480
First was.

169
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,119
The player experience needed to be better, right,

170
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:49,769
so

171
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,259
meaning scale, but there were also

172
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,588
some ongoing issues and things with, uh,

173
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,459
you know, latency,

174
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,959
lag, packet loss was something that we heard a

175
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,738
lot about. There was definitely some room for

176
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,519
improvement in those areas.

177
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,439
The second was

178
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,548
The Respawn team, they wanted to modernize their hosting.

179
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:07,428
Um,

180
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:10,439
Respawn wanted better access to things like logs,

181
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:11,750
observability,

182
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,088
uh, they wanted to iterate faster. They also

183
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,910
wanted access to modern hardware, which

184
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:18,569
meant moving off of bare metal, obviously. I think one

185
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,329
thing that became super clear to me,

186
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,738
um, and the rest of the AWS folks was

187
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:24,108
that if Respawn

188
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,028
and Apex were to make a move,

189
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:28,790
uh, parity was not good enough,

190
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:29,858
right? Um, data,

191
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,798
uh, Jared made it very clear that.

192
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,369
They needed to have some real

193
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,420
data-driven impact to justify any changes

194
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,170
they were going to make to their their service.

195
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,399
Lastly, and I think this is a really big one, but it's

196
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,319
super critical for a studio,

197
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,040
uh, in general, but especially a studio like Respawn,

198
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:49,040
uh, to maintain developer velocity.

199
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:50,879
Um, Apex is certainly,

200
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,540
you know, again, they're pushing out new versions, new

201
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,199
updates to the game

202
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,459
into production.

203
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:57,819
Those launch dates, those new

204
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:58,420
seasons,

205
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,238
those dates don't shift,

206
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,178
um, so speed and agility is really

207
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:04,858
essential for a studio like Respawn.

208
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,449
So again, they were really looking for not only a

209
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,699
change, but they were looking for a technology that was going

210
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,649
to adapt with them

211
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,379
and not vice versa.

212
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,319
So with all that said again, Respawn really

213
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,540
looking for a new partner, a new platform,

214
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,108
really looking for an opportunity to innovate and

215
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:21,699
improve,

216
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,199
um, and the reality is I think you know

217
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,980
Respawn's probably,

218
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,639
uh, they're not alone, uh, probably a lot of folks

219
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,899
in this room are in the same boat,

220
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,000
um,

221
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,439
you know, these multiplayer games, they're hard, right? They're

222
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,139
really hard, they have unique challenges,

223
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,619
um, and before we talk about how

224
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,838
we solve those challenges and the solutions that we have

225
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:41,290
to. Uh,

226
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,759
to, to help you guys out, um, I'm gonna hand the mic

227
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,559
over to Tom

228
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,069
who's gonna talk more about the nature of

229
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,678
multiplayer games, what makes them so difficult, and,

230
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,689
uh, how we help to solve that. So Tom, over to

231
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,699
you. Yeah,

232
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:55,379
so, uh,

233
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:56,678
as Trevor said.

234
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,559
Multiplayer games are hard at that high level,

235
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,988
there's so many things going on with multiplayer

236
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:03,298
games to actually make

237
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,819
the components that allow players to play.

238
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,358
So if you look at here, this might be a typical er

239
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,480
a diagram of uh of what a live service games

240
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,509
look like, and this doesn't include all the components.

241
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,100
At the top there we've got the game back end,

242
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,600
so you've got services like entitlement, what

243
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,639
players have access to what weapons and

244
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,879
skins, what are they uh actually able

245
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,059
to access in the game?

246
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,139
We've got things like economy that drives

247
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,470
the live service model. What players have bought

248
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,720
what, what are they spending credits on, what is their bank

249
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,879
balance or their wallet look like. These things are so

250
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,820
important for the game.

251
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,570
We've got services that make the game fun, things

252
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,570
like achievements, leaderboards, ranked,

253
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,769
status, all these things that actually engage

254
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,928
players, um, and are, yeah, make the game

255
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:43,908
more exciting.

256
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,229
Then you have the kind of backend services like analytics,

257
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,529
er, what maps, what characters are

258
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,639
players playing the most of? All of these things

259
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,649
that kind of drive the decisions in the game, where

260
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,769
are players having fun, what are they enjoying?

261
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,580
And then finally you have services like remote

262
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,779
config which allow you to make those changes quickly

263
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,940
to a live service game. What damage does that

264
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,678
weapon do?

265
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:06,330
Uh, what maps are on rotation right now, what's

266
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,418
currently being played, so these things can be tweaked

267
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,538
without having to push a whole new version of the game, which

268
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:12,408
is again critical for responding

269
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,399
to those player impacts that we're seeing.

270
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,340
That's just one blob of of that live service

271
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,500
infrastructure, you've then got the multiplayer back

272
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,200
end which we're gonna talk loads about today,

273
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,109
the matchmaker, the lobby service, the scaling,

274
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,379
um how do we have enough compute online for people

275
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,320
to actually be able to play at any one time.

276
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,668
And then you've got all the stuff that happens behind the scenes,

277
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,200
the development environment, staging, QA,

278
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,719
CICD pipelines for being able to deploy

279
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,190
all of this really quickly, 456

280
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,379
builds a day so that we can test new features really quickly.

281
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:44,418
All of this stuff needs to get built into a whole framework,

282
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,639
which then allows us to get content out to players

283
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,859
as quickly as possible.

284
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,889
And with all of these services, any

285
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,989
single one having a slight disruption or issue

286
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,139
or problem means player pain. It

287
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,149
means players can't play or we can't get stuff out to

288
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,009
players quick enough.

289
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,690
So it's a hard problem to solve.

290
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,629
When we look at the number of players playing or

291
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,649
capacity available, we see

292
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,500
massive swings day to day. Each of these spikes

293
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,739
represents a kind of 24 hour period in

294
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:11,808
a live service game.

295
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,389
And this is normal to see things

296
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,649
like, um, time zones rotating,

297
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,750
different types of players coming on at different

298
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,750
types of days, uh, certain

299
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,908
maps rotating. All these things are just

300
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,989
our player base and how many players are playing at

301
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,038
once. It can also

302
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:28,538
be external things like

303
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,158
sports tournaments or public holidays,

304
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,359
other games going down and suddenly loads more

305
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,678
people are showing up in your game. This all

306
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,798
things we need to consider as part of the capacity

307
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:39,798
planning and how we adapt on a day to

308
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:40,639
day basis.

309
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:44,259
And then when we look at a more yearly basis

310
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,729
or month over month, we then see bigger shifts

311
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,769
in player dynamics.

312
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,099
So here are 3 kind of season

313
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,678
launches, and you can see here

314
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:54,379
when new content gets put out in a game, loads

315
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,399
of players show up, they want to play the cool new stuff,

316
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,658
right? Um, so we've got to think

317
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,820
about that and all the different capacity planning,

318
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,340
planning and deployment that comes with these

319
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,519
new season launches, keeping the game fresh,

320
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:06,739
keeping the game fun.

321
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,369
And then on the other side of that, if we're

322
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,649
not seeing players and we're seeing a decline for whatever

323
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,729
reason or slight shifts in that, we need to think

324
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:14,989
about bringing that capacity down,

325
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,330
protecting the revenue of the studio and making sure that

326
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,450
they have all the funds available to be able to put it

327
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,548
right back into the game and build the content.

328
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,808
Those pennies need to get spent on

329
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:24,889
how the player is

330
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,250
playing and enjoying the game and not the back

331
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,950
end things.

332
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:32,168
So of course whatever happens with all of these

333
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,489
capacity planning or different parts of the stack,

334
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,840
the player experience has to come first.

335
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,250
Our goal is the game, for the game to be up

336
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,330
24/7 in all time zones,

337
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:43,548
working efficiently. That's what our job is.

338
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,969
And for game servers, it's not just the capacity we

339
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:46,908
need to think about.

340
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,609
A game like Apex has a high

341
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,649
proportion of ranked matches, so we need to

342
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,769
be very considerate of things like latency,

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,769
location, how we're matching together.

344
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,788
Apex itself has an even bigger challenge,

345
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,830
which is 60 player matches. So how

346
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,950
do we find 60 players in different regions that are trying

347
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,788
to play in the right

348
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,149
game type, game mode, all these different

349
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,308
things go into matchmaking decisions which are just hard

350
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,750
problems to solve. So lots to think about um

351
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,229
when we are thinking about this migration.

352
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,729
So Trevor, do you want to tell us a little bit about the Gamelift service

353
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:18,298
product and and why this might be a good fit? Absolutely.

354
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,639
So how do we help? What can we do, right?

355
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,969
So let's talk about Gamelift servers. So

356
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,469
it's a service that's been around for a while. You've

357
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,489
likely looked at Gamelift in the

358
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,798
past. I would encourage you

359
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:30,960
to take a look at it today.

360
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,580
Um, it's a completely different product that's changed a lot over

361
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,178
the years.

362
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,019
Uh, we have an incredible product and leadership

363
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,058
team who's really driving the Gamelift roadmap.

364
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:40,259
So, um,

365
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,558
again, take a look at it today.

366
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,119
I'm really curious to get your feedback on it, but a little bit more

367
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:46,820
about Game Lift and what it is specifically. It's a purpose-built

368
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:49,840
game server hosting solution for multiplayer games, meaning

369
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:52,210
it's fully managed. It's a fully managed service. It

370
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,639
takes the operational burden

371
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,080
of having to manage game servers

372
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,340
off of the end user.

373
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,250
Right, so it's a service that's

374
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:01,750
built on the back of AWS. It has

375
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,739
global coverage. It knows how to scale.

376
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,239
We recently ran a 100

377
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,349
million CCU player test to validate

378
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,359
that level of scale,

379
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,908
and Tom's going to talk more about that here in a minute, but

380
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:13,729
it also offers

381
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,349
flexible hybrid options.

382
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,908
So some studios, they only want

383
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:19,538
to operate in a hybrid model,

384
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:22,109
so the service allows you to bring your own compute

385
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,889
if that's a requirement for you.

386
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,950
There's also a feature called Game Lift Anywhere.

387
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,558
Which is um a component where

388
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,739
you can test locally

389
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,119
so you don't have to spin up a bunch of compute, uh,

390
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:35,649
essentially just send a game session to your local desktop.

391
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,678
A few other things that I think differentiate uh

392
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:39,899
Gamelift here are,

393
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:43,019
um, there's a service or a feature called Flex Match

394
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,599
which is our matchmaking service built inside of

395
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,178
Gamelift

396
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:48,969
containers, this is another big one, but, um,

397
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:51,139
Gamelift now supports containers for

398
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,000
building and running, uh, game server packages.

399
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:57,330
Back-end plug-ins, there's a lot of new integrations

400
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,330
with popular game backends whether

401
00:13:59,330 --> 00:13:59,869
it's

402
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,129
Pragma or ExcelByte.

403
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,788
Those integrations are baked into Game lift as well.

404
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,519
Telemetry metrics, this is also a really big one that we've

405
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,609
heard from our customers as well, but a lot of really

406
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:11,330
good data capture around.

407
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,379
Uh, Fleet performance, game

408
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,479
session activities, server process health,

409
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,538
things of that nature are all

410
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,519
what you can find inside a game lift.

411
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,349
This slide here really illustrates

412
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,710
the kind of global presence of

413
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,788
Game lift. So anywhere players

414
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:28,489
are playing,

415
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,168
we likely have a presence in that region

416
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,389
or that location. We're continuing to improve that

417
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,629
and likely this slide that you're looking at here

418
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,989
is probably outdated as of today because we're

419
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,590
constantly adding new regions, new zones

420
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,330
for Game lift.

421
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:44,269
I think by the end of next year we'll have about 55

422
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,330
local zones and regions that Game lift supports.

423
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,149
Outside of these regions, outside of these local zones,

424
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:50,940
there's also many different

425
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,519
instance types and sizes that you can find with Game lift.

426
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,109
So it's uh,

427
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,960
if you're looking for C class,

428
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,269
M class instances, those are all available with Game lift

429
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:59,918
as well, um.

430
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,950
So that's, that's Game lift in general and kind of just

431
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,989
a brief overview of the service, but I think now that you

432
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,070
have, uh, I guess now that you have an understanding

433
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,070
of what Gamelift is, how

434
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,109
it operates, how it scales, I'm gonna throw it

435
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:11,979
back over to Tom,

436
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,509
talk a little bit more about some of the data, some of the,

437
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,668
the graphs, and some of the things that we've seen in terms of

438
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:18,099
implementation and what that looks like.

439
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:20,989
Yeah, cool, thanks Trevor.

440
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,408
So I appreciate for some folks, er,

441
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,548
this looks like a very boring graph, but for me as

442
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,548
an engineer, it's possibly one of the greatest graphs ever.

443
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,428
Um, blue line shows the service availability

444
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,330
for game lift over quite a long period of time

445
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,788
against the green line which is their target service

446
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,190
level objective or SLO.

447
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,788
So what you can see here, um, rock solid

448
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,950
platform, no real problems at all,

449
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:43,070
and really built for that scale, um, and high

450
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,808
availability.

451
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,399
Same graph in terms of time, so uh looking at

452
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,000
the same time period, but you can see here incoming

453
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,820
request volume

454
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,200
to the Game lift service, um and what we talked

455
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
about earlier with the kind of player populations and

456
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,428
things spiking day to day, you can see that on the left, right,

457
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,058
you can see those constantly changing um.

458
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,649
Amounts of players and therefore incoming APR

459
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:03,330
request volumes,

460
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,889
um, but the thing that's really interesting here is these larger

461
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,440
spikes. These are seasonal launches,

462
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:09,489
game launches,

463
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,849
big events, um, and even

464
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,918
with this massively changing call volume,

465
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,729
still 99.99%

466
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,729
availability in terms of actually delivered

467
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,788
by the team, which I think is absolutely phenomenal.

468
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,719
Um, and not only that, one of my favorite parts about working

469
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,918
with the Game lift team is they're really good at shipping stuff.

470
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,658
Um,

471
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I personally feel, having worked in live service

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
for a long time, it's very hard to ship new features

473
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,359
quickly whilst keeping a really rock

474
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,399
solid platform. What we typically see is when

475
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,320
new features get shipped, they're a bit ropy for a,

476
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,719
for a little while, um, whilst things

477
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,724
see with other. Platforms, but we just don't see that

478
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,004
here. So, um, some examples of some awesome

479
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,315
new features in the last 4 months SSM

480
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:49,445
in console. So if you're debugging a problem as a

481
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,774
developer and you've got an issue with one of your game servers, literally

482
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:53,923
being able to click a button in the UI and get

483
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,163
straight on the console of your Linux box is

484
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,134
just awesome, uh,

485
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:00,085
really speeds up the kind of developer debugging workflow.

486
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,729
Um, we've got Gamelift servers telemetry metrics,

487
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,858
so Gamelift already has a, a pretty rich monitoring

488
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,009
stack, but this is directly getting stats out of your

489
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,130
game server itself. So if you want to do custom metrics

490
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,630
and things and then visualizing them, um,

491
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,009
in places like Grafana, which is, uh, fantastic,

492
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,890
we'll talk a lot about observability in a minute.

493
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,948
And then we've got some other features like uh local zone

494
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:21,327
expansion, so getting servers closer to players,

495
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,698
uh, new OS support and uh updated

496
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,817
plug-ins for newer versions of things like Unreal, which is,

497
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,048
is fantastic to see.

498
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,309
So it was quick to see, or we quickly

499
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,410
understood stood as a team that Gamelift was going to be the

500
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,900
right tech choice for Apex, um,

501
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,568
but Respawn were focused on shipping

502
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,910
awesome game content and quite frankly,

503
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,368
they should be focused on the players and getting stuff

504
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:45,130
out. They didn't want to do a migration, right? Um, so

505
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,588
how are we going to actually get that done?

506
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,368
Well, we formed a bit of a better together partnership

507
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,449
between AWS and and Code Wizards.

508
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,630
Picking that rock solid high scale, um,

509
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:58,199
high performance service for actually doing the workload

510
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,420
itself, but also

511
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,759
game centric humans who know games, know

512
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,959
how to ship games, and can actually do a migration.

513
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,828
But not only that,

514
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,939
support the game and help improve the game

515
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:09,640
post launch. We talked about parity is not

516
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,689
good enough, so this was one of the things that we really

517
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,838
wanted to do is continue that improvement once we'd

518
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:14,719
done the migration.

519
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:17,578
So together we make a really strong package

520
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:19,299
for helping game studios run in the cloud.

521
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,029
So a few examples of that, um,

522
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,338
Gamelift already has a really great monitoring stack, you can see

523
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,348
that in the UI and have a look at your fleet overview

524
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:29,750
and things like that. We wanted to go a little bit deeper.

525
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,259
So when you've got a title that's already

526
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:34,269
running, there's lots of custom things

527
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:36,670
that have been built over the years which uh need

528
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,890
supporting and adapting.

529
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,309
Um, so we built on top of this

530
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,568
to give some of that rich monitoring like

531
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,739
things like per game session data,

532
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,150
overall game dashboards, custom

533
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,469
game metrics that are specific to Apex,

534
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:50,229
things like that.

535
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,689
And we built them already into workflows that they

536
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,769
were used to using, so that meant that the development

537
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,588
teams didn't need to adjust their

538
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,930
day to day work, working and they could focus on

539
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,009
shipping game content which was really important to us. So

540
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,910
this was a kind of a key part of the project.

541
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,250
And then we also needed to think about doing the

542
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,368
migration itself, right, and and building some tooling

543
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:09,078
to allow that.

544
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:11,739
This is things like um custom CICD

545
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:14,358
pipelines already built into their existing

546
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,410
uh kind of deployment flows. It's

547
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,449
the zero downtime patching process to make sure that

548
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,608
we could ship content out to players

549
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:21,868
without taking the game down.

550
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,489
Um, and some special migration

551
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:26,519
tooling to actually do the migration itself, which we're going to

552
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,910
talk, uh, quite a bit about.

553
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,680
Um, I wanna give a shout out to the Gamelish team here

554
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,078
actually. They built in as part of this migration,

555
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,250
some new APIs into the product for everyone,

556
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,598
um, which made this migration a lot easier.

557
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
Just specific ways of working with different

558
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,068
types of servers.

559
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,500
One of the nice things about the product is it's not,

560
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,630
um, er, you have to use it this way.

561
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
There's lots of different ways to use the product depending on

562
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,739
your game and, and your workflow and how you want to use

563
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,578
it. So

564
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,779
one of the key points we formed

565
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,900
early on in this project was everything we

566
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,739
did had to be about player experience.

567
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,459
So we had to take all of those different points that we were working

568
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:03,578
through and tie them back to how are we going to improve

569
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,660
this for the player, um, and not

570
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,680
just keep what what we had running right now.

571
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,500
So this meant that we spent a lot of time

572
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:13,259
thinking a bit differently about things like metrics,

573
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:15,500
deployment processes, how we were actually going to do

574
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
things to see if we could er er

575
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,838
build a, a better system really.

576
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,959
And then we also needed to think about post

577
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,420
migration, so we'd got the migration done, yay, great.

578
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,618
Um, but afterwards we had to think about

579
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,479
how are we're going to continue that constant

580
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,519
improvement, that continued support. Um, so

581
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,529
we actually, in addition to the migration,

582
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,219
helped out with providing a 24/7 service

583
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:39,358
with games operations expert to kind of keep the

584
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,640
monitoring, keep improving, finding those proactive

585
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,180
games and improving things over time.

586
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,299
The service is a mix of monitoring, alerting,

587
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,459
and ultimately super smart humans that

588
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,130
catch issues before players see them,

589
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,529
and that's been really great, I think long term for

590
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,309
us improving this service.

591
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So let's have a look at the fun stuff, the actual migration

592
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,068
itself, um, 10 days, 0 downtime,

593
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,420
like what does good look like?

594
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,279
So we started with a bit of a very high level

595
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,559
uh plan, um we wanted initially

596
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,920
to build out a proof of concept.

597
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:12,799
What was that going to look like and could we actually

598
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:13,959
make the game work.

599
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,729
Then we went into a build phase, building all the migration

600
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:18,318
tooling, building all these things that were going to happen.

601
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,500
We went into a test phase and then we did the migrations

602
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,739
themselves, starting with dev and ending up in production.

603
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:27,539
So the proof of concept,

604
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,660
we started first with

605
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,108
3 kind of core pillars that we were

606
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:34,118
going to achieve to to prove to us

607
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,578
that this was actually going to work, that this was going to be something viable.

608
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,219
We started with the main flow.

609
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,880
Can players smoothly and quickly connect

610
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
to game lift servers and play a match? It was as simple

611
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,858
as that, right? Is this thing actually going to work?

612
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,430
Then one of the key points we needed to look at was zero

613
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,019
downtime,

614
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,890
the ability to patch the game

615
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,309
without disrupting players at all. So being able to

616
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:56,588
iterate constantly on game patches, get

617
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,789
content out to players, and not having to worry

618
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,828
about taking the game down or or changing any

619
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:02,828
player behavior um to allow

620
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:03,549
us to do that.

621
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:06,338
And then finally, and we talked a lot about this, metrics

622
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:07,328
and observability.

623
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,930
The reason why this was so important was because

624
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,009
we found it difficult to know

625
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,900
what's this parity thing mean, how can we prove

626
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,029
that we've done better, and we're all engineers,

627
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,189
right, we wanted to prove that with numbers. So we wanted to

628
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:21,279
start with what's our baseline, what does good look like,

629
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:22,890
and then we knew when we'd make a change,

630
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:25,709
what what and how has that improved things, and

631
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,709
that really helped actually with picking some of the

632
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,828
paths and decision points that we made along the way.

633
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,969
It also means that we could give

634
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,130
the operations teams and the developer teams

635
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,439
access to all the information, including some new things,

636
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,809
so they can react really quickly to things happening in the

637
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,890
game. Again, live service is all about

638
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,750
being able to adapt to the players.

639
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,729
So we moved past the POC and then we got into a

640
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:48,640
full project plan.

641
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,979
Um, so we mapped out all of the major milestones

642
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:52,989
that needed to happen. You can see along the top here,

643
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,828
all of the different parts that made up the migration.

644
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,180
Um, the eagle-eyed amongst you might

645
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,219
notice that the planning for this project was indeed a little

646
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:02,299
bit more than 10 days. Um, it takes

647
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,500
a lot of work to be able to pull off a migration

648
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,640
like this. Um, we say 10 days,

649
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,140
but I think we could have actually done the migration in, in

650
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,699
1 day or maybe even two.

651
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,059
We purposefully picked 10 days because we wanted

652
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,059
to do it slow and steady and

653
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,088
be able to do it in a really

654
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:19,380
kind of measured way, and we'll talk about why we

655
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,039
did that in a bit.

656
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,650
We had to get things right on the on the

657
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,959
timeline around um er

658
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,209
December holidays, but also around season

659
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,949
releases. We could not get in the way

660
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,250
of the team shipping content, so we had to think

661
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,328
about the migration and how that would map into all of

662
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:35,670
the content plans they had,

663
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,368
including doing season launches whilst we were doing migrations

664
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:39,430
and things like that. So

665
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,489
really critical as part of the planning

666
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:43,130
um and really important.

667
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,338
So we made a bit of a plan and then we got into the build

668
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,630
phase. So we started

669
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,670
by thinking about uh what the

670
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,750
right architecture should look like and how we should do

671
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,769
things. Um, we talked

672
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,809
at the very beginning about one of the key

673
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,959
parts of this project was we could not

674
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,029
impact respawn game development. They had to be focused

675
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,209
on shipping core content,

676
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:05,608
um, which meant no changes to the,

677
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,328
to the game server or the game client.

678
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,699
So that was one of the architectural choices that we were

679
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,368
making, no changes to the game itself.

680
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,670
So we had to think about how we were going to

681
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,509
design around that.

682
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,279
We worked heavily with the Game lift team also to

683
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,279
build something that wasn't just going to get them through

684
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,439
a migration and then they'd be landed with a bunch of tech

685
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,660
debt after the migration.

686
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
We wanted to think about what tolling could we

687
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,059
build to allow the migration to happen, but then give

688
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,318
points that we could then build on in the future

689
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,358
to make it even better. So we had to really think

690
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:34,209
about what,

691
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:35,318
instead of just

692
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,868
get them off their current provider and get them onto game lift

693
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,920
as quickly as possible, what did the future look

694
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,479
like? How are we going to improve this?

695
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,939
So first thing to note on the left hand side of this diagram

696
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:46,219
you can see obviously there's the players.

697
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:48,779
So um a player loads up an Apex game

698
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,219
client and they connect to a matchmaking

699
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:53,250
backend, so that's um er respawn's

700
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,779
game backend.

701
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:56,199
That then decides

702
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,559
who's going to play together, what matches are gonna happen,

703
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,000
all those different points of things, and then it

704
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,199
fires off an APR request to uh a

705
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,130
provider to say, hey, I'd like a game server.

706
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:07,598
The game server, the information for that

707
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,680
IP address, all those things come back uh

708
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,789
and the players can connect to the game server, so that's the kind of

709
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:12,838
rough end to end flow.

710
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,219
What we decided to do

711
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,578
was

712
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,799
a design that had two components.

713
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,519
The first component we called portal.

714
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,759
So you can think of this as like uh

715
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,799
an API proxy, um or

716
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,910
a kind of game-based load balancer I guess.

717
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,348
So it captured those requests from the Respawn game

718
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:32,680
backend, which was ultimately talking in the

719
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,900
it it to the API to the previous provider,

720
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,160
um, and we mimicked those APIs so that we could capture

721
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,259
incoming requests.

722
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,000
Um, we had the ability to then just transparently

723
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,239
proxy those requests through to the old provider, which

724
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,318
meant that uh we could essentially be

725
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:47,358
in the loop but uh keeping things as

726
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:49,689
they were. We then implemented

727
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:51,729
the SDK for um Amazon Gamelift

728
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,809
servers and that allowed us to set those

729
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,358
things up and we then had this ability

730
00:25:56,358 --> 00:25:58,568
to be able to take in an API request from the respawn's

731
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:00,769
game back end and either send it to the old

732
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,799
provider or send it to Amazon Game Lift Services, so

733
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,989
we had a bit of control there.

734
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,400
On top of that, we then built a bit of software

735
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,539
that we called Switcher,

736
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,160
and its job was to be able

737
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,479
to very carefully and fine-grainedly

738
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:15,108
control where we were pushing requests,

739
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,640
so broken down by things like region

740
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,920
or even game type,

741
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,519
we could set a percentage of how many requests

742
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,380
we wanted to go

743
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,920
and where we wanted them to go, and that actually ended

744
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,140
up being one of the key parts of This migration

745
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,979
was so smooth.

746
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:30,838
Um, so, uh, an example of what this might look like,

747
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:32,430
uh, we set in a config file,

748
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:34,739
hey, in Australia we want 1% of

749
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,848
requests to go to Amazon Gamelift, and we want

750
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:39,078
99% of requests to go to the old provider.

751
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:41,259
And then we could adapt that on the fly constantly

752
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,358
to adjust when we were doing the migration itself.

753
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,660
Um, and that ended up being, yeah, one of the reasons

754
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,818
we could do it in such a controlled and slow manner.

755
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,459
And the second part of the architecture

756
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,019
was what we called the wrapper.

757
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,890
So once that requests made its made its

758
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,890
way down to an actual uh virtual machine

759
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,890
itself, um we then need to start the game server

760
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,068
binary to actually uh yeah, start the game.

761
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,598
Um, we couldn't implement the

762
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,880
Amazon Game Lift Services SDK in the

763
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,088
uh in the game server itself because again,

764
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:11,848
we didn't want the respawn team having to worry about

765
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:14,009
that sort of infrastructure. We wanted them shipping game

766
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,229
content. So we built a little go binary

767
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:17,529
that implements that SDK.

768
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,348
When the request comes in, we start a game server

769
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,739
and that allows the whole flow to happen and and

770
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:23,848
players to be able to connect.

771
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,309
So that ended up, uh, we initially were thinking that this

772
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,430
might not be a, a wise design choice cos we're

773
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,430
essentially adding another loop in the chain, right, but it

774
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,709
actually turned out to be an excellent uh decision

775
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:36,068
because we then had a lot of things that we could do externally

776
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:38,670
of the game server binary. Things like telemetry,

777
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,858
logging, monitoring, um,

778
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:43,229
a bunch of which already exist in the SDKs

779
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,229
in game of servers, and then we built on top of

780
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,670
those to add some even more, uh, rich

781
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,068
metrics and things like that for the respawn team. So it actually

782
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,219
turned out to be a really wise, uh, um,

783
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:53,170
architectural choice.

784
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:56,029
Um, for anyone who wants to give this a go, the wrapper is actually

785
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:58,068
open source. Um, uh, you can get it

786
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:00,078
on that QR code and have a look. Just allows you to

787
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,108
get up and running with Gamelift servers really quickly, so I'd,

788
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:04,130
I'd urge you to give it a try and try, try it out.

789
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,838
So we built a thing.

790
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:09,118
We had this architecture in place. We'd built

791
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:11,219
the code um and we were ready to go. Well,

792
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,598
we didn't want to go live without doing some testing, of

793
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,729
course. So, uh,

794
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,130
once we'd built all those tools, the serious testing

795
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,509
kind of started to kick off.

796
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,170
Um, and as I talked about before, it was really

797
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,368
important to have a baseline of what good luck, good looks

798
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,789
like before we even started.

799
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,328
So how would we, how

800
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:30,449
would we know that the low test is successful? Well, we'd only

801
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:31,430
really do that with data.

802
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,588
So early on before we started testing we set some SLOs

803
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,689
based on all the metrics we had from the game that was

804
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:37,390
currently running.

805
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,368
Some examples things like queue times,

806
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:41,170
match placement,

807
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:42,130
success rates,

808
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:44,729
you know, how quickly players can get into a match, all these

809
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:46,750
kind of things were things that we measured quite early on

810
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,068
and had a Rough idea of

811
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,949
what we needed to hit as part of these low tests.

812
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,390
Um, this would turn out to be really critical

813
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,348
for us because we could then measure what we were improving.

814
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:57,630
Uh we made this change, oh, it made it better, oh, we made this change,

815
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,979
oh, not quite so good, right, we need to try something else. So

816
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:02,029
that was a really critical kind of design choice early

817
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,289
on. We

818
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,328
took the overall testing plan and we broke it down into

819
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,108
three categories.

820
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,789
The first one being what we call component testing.

821
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,489
So going right back to the beginning of this talk when we talked

822
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,608
about the multiplayer game, um, kind of

823
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:16,920
overall system and all those different components,

824
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,289
we take a component at a time and we look

825
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,049
at how they're going to be run in production.

826
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,410
So what requests are coming in, what requests

827
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:23,949
are going out.

828
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,209
We use um a tool called K6 from

829
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,209
Grafana and we um use

830
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,328
that to build realistic production patterns

831
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:33,509
to kind of throw at services. So ultimately we're just flooding

832
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,828
a service with API requests and seeing how it responds.

833
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,328
Um, but again,

834
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,358
having that measurement,

835
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:40,848
understanding what good looks like and then being

836
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:42,969
able to adjust those um uh

837
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,750
tests on the fly worked really well.

838
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,769
So we took those components, that's portal,

839
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,269
the wrapper, the respawn, matchmaker,

840
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,309
all the different parts of the stack, game lift itself,

841
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,709
and then we threw these requests at them and see,

842
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,959
are we above our thresholds or below

843
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,809
our thresholds, are we looking good?

844
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,348
Once we knew each component looked good,

845
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:04,509
we then moved on to what we call.

846
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:08,000
Functional testing. So this is where we connect

847
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,039
all the components together.

848
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:11,809
And we run a kind of low and slow

849
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,289
test, so for 24, 48,

850
00:30:14,368 --> 00:30:16,449
72 hours we run a smaller number of

851
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,828
game servers, but we run them continuously.

852
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:21,130
And the reason this is important is you test

853
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,219
that you can reuse matches, you test

854
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:25,250
it for memory leaks, you test

855
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,719
for port binding issues,

856
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,289
server reuse problems, all these things that

857
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:30,910
might happen when you're constantly

858
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,564
having players cycle in. Out of matches.

859
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:36,275
Um, this testing is quite critical because a lot of people

860
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,463
do that kind of big load test through a load of

861
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,164
API requests and go, Cool, everything was green,

862
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:42,834
and then you miss a critical memory leak or you miss

863
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,943
the second time the server boots up, it doesn't actually

864
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,005
work because it hasn't released its port properly.

865
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:49,505
So these things are really critical to kind of

866
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:51,505
test, and this actually ended up

867
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:54,064
finding a few problems that we then had to tweak and

868
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,864
figure things out, so it was really worthwhile doing.

869
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,848
Um, the metrics we use to do, uh, functional

870
00:30:58,848 --> 00:31:00,930
testing are usually player experience metrics, so

871
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,108
things like time to match, latency,

872
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,670
how quickly I can get into a match, those are really critical,

873
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:07,689
uh, things for, for functional testing.

874
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,049
Final test, this is the fun one, the large

875
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,088
scale test, right? Throw that lever to a million,

876
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:16,118
see how much compute we can get. Um,

877
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,049
Spinning up global live service scale

878
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:21,328
machines costs some serious investment, um,

879
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:22,489
monetarily, that is.

880
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,670
So you really only want to do this a few times,

881
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,049
um, in your game's life cycle, and you only really

882
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:29,068
want to do it when you're kind of 90% certain

883
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,209
that both your, um, component and your

884
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:32,430
functional tests are working correctly.

885
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,930
So don't throw a load of, of money at a big low

886
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,160
test when you're not quite sure that you're going to pass. Um,

887
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,390
this really needs to be your kind of last line of defense.

888
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,699
Measuring for this is all about the outcomes that

889
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:44,799
we already talked about, right? Time to match latency

890
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,979
is the same as those other tests, but does that

891
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:48,880
continue to work at higher levels of scale?

892
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,489
We did this test in in super close conjunction with the

893
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,489
Game lift team who were watching all of the stats on their

894
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:56,568
side, making sure everything looked great and also

895
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:59,049
with the Reesbourn folks too, so it was a really collaborative

896
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,949
thing um and quite a fun test actually.

897
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:04,318
Um, side note from us, one of the things that we

898
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:06,920
really wanted to do as part of that large

899
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
scale test was testing it as if we

900
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,759
were in production. Well, what does that mean?

901
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,150
Well, if I've got hundreds of thousands of players

902
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,180
playing a game and I suddenly need to roll out a security

903
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,479
patch, I should be able to patch that without disrupting

904
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,640
100,000 players. So let's do that as part of the load

905
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,880
test. Let's do an AB patch and see how it actually

906
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,279
works. Again, making sure that all those ancillary

907
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,880
things that you need to do once you've shipped a game actually

908
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,078
work at that level of scale.

909
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:31,410
Some other side advice from from a few years of doing

910
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,029
this is

911
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,729
remember to test all of the ancillary services

912
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:36,729
that come around the game, so

913
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,729
things like crash handling, monitoring

914
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,769
and observability, all those different parts

915
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,368
of the stack.

916
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,769
Quite often we see that with game launches, the

917
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,848
focus is on. Hey, is the compute working?

918
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,279
Is everything online, and not about all the additional

919
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,529
services. And we've often seen game developers

920
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,650
launch a game, ship brilliantly, the game servers

921
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,769
are working, but they're completely blind because their monitoring stack

922
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:56,848
fell over. Um, so a really important thing

923
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:58,150
to test as part of those large,

924
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,910
large scale low tests as well.

925
00:33:01,828 --> 00:33:03,910
So we've built a thing, we've tested the thing

926
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,529
and we're happy.

927
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:06,709
Now we need to plan for an actual migration.

928
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:08,559
Um

929
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,568
Our portal tool, as we talked about, allowed us

930
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,608
to move a percentage of requests bit by bit, and

931
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:15,890
that actually ended up forming a large part of the strategy

932
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,868
here. So we would pick a region at a time

933
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:21,170
and we would look at what percentage looked reasonable. So 10%

934
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,449
migrated, 20% migrated, 30%

935
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:25,969
migrated, and we could do it in really slow stages

936
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:28,088
whilst watching the metrics,

937
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,449
seeing what was going on and really quickly rolling back

938
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:31,250
if we needed to.

939
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,318
Rollback for this service took around

940
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,598
30 seconds, so we could really quickly adapt

941
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,848
if we were seeing metrics that weren't quite right.

942
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,358
Roll back, have a look at it, analyze it, what

943
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:43,358
went wrong, and go again. And it just meant that

944
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:45,640
we weren't panicking because we were halfway through a migration

945
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,729
and something wasn't working correctly. It's fine, roll it back.

946
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,088
Let's have a look at what's going on. And that actually worked out

947
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:50,750
again to be

948
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:52,680
really, really smooth as part of the

949
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,108
the final migration.

950
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,868
The really interesting learning from this was not actually

951
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,250
technical at all. Um,

952
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,670
in doing this and being really confident and doing

953
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,108
really small steps, um, we built confidence

954
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,108
both as a project team, but also with Respawn, right? We

955
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,608
were moving their game, it's a scary thing.

956
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:10,110
Um, we built confidence really early on

957
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,309
that this was going to work correctly. We knew and trusted

958
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:14,510
the process and everything was working well, so it

959
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,628
wasn't actually a technical reason for this at all. It was

960
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:17,369
more the human,

961
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,869
uh, element of being able to go, no, we totally

962
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:21,869
trust the process and we totally trust the metrics and

963
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:22,829
we're, and we're ready to go.

964
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,489
Some very boring but very important things.

965
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,869
Carefully scheduling all these different migrations

966
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:30,449
around,

967
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,148
patching, security releases, season

968
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:35,510
releases, all those things was pretty critical

969
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,750
and ended up with a lot of kind of calendar Tetris,

970
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,829
but again worked really well.

971
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:41,268
Only having one change go out to production. At

972
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,548
once, whether you're doing a migration or a patch or whatever

973
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,188
was really good because again we made

974
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:48,467
this change and this thing happened so we could roll it back quickly

975
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,539
or you know we just knew exactly what was

976
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:52,548
going on. We weren't wait, was it your change or my change

977
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,748
or was it the season launch or this? So once

978
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,947
we planned that carefully, that worked really well and again

979
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:58,088
allowed us to move really quickly.

980
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,128
And again, very boring, but lots

981
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:02,510
and lots of maintenance notifications.

982
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:04,969
Who's doing what, when are they doing it, what's just been

983
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,010
done, what's not been done, when are we rolling back, when

984
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,250
are we not? Really, really good communication

985
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,389
between Rees Bourn and

986
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:13,449
AWS. Everyone knows what's going on, and

987
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,570
again, everyone can react to the same thing

988
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,878
then. Um,

989
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,329
some final other things, um,

990
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,898
especially when you're thinking about a large migration like this,

991
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,219
um, big capacity planning. If we're

992
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:26,489
about to move 50% of a location over,

993
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,079
let's make sure we've got the right level of servers pre-warmed.

994
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:31,458
Do we know exactly what we need? Are we going to go over

995
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,320
the top, or

996
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,199
are we going to come in slightly under?

997
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,820
So again, we had to think quite a lot about that,

998
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,898
how much capacity do we want to pre-warm without just

999
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:39,599
wasting money.

1000
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:40,918
Um, so that was cool.

1001
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,378
And also being really considerate

1002
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:44,539
of time zones.

1003
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:47,570
Doing these kind of migrations out of peak

1004
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,889
time zones is great because there's less players, therefore

1005
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,469
potentially less disruption,

1006
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:54,050
but then you're not actually testing when the region does come

1007
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,090
into peak. So if you're going to do it at the low

1008
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,398
time zone, you need to think about how you're monitoring

1009
00:35:58,398 --> 00:36:00,489
when it does come into peak and you're at your highest level

1010
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:01,269
of capacity.

1011
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,780
Um, so there's actually swings and roundabouts to be,

1012
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:06,179
uh, do I do it in the peak time zone, um,

1013
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,260
and do I trust that migration, but I know that this is

1014
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,418
going to be the kind of highest player point for,

1015
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,619
for the next few days, or do I do it in the low

1016
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,668
and then watch later on. So there's a, there's some

1017
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:15,579
considerations to,

1018
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,239
to that. We actually picked,

1019
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,300
depending on the region, a combination of both.

1020
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,208
So finally we started with the actual migration.

1021
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,340
Um, we started with development.

1022
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,340
Interesting learning here, it was actually harder than

1023
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,458
production on reflection.

1024
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,820
Well, why is that? Um,

1025
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,599
lots and lots of change in a, in a,

1026
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:37,300
um, development environment for a game studio. 234,

1027
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:39,539
1015 builds a day sometimes get pushed

1028
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:41,619
into a development environment when people are testing.

1029
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,978
That means you've got QA teams sat around wanting

1030
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:46,039
to test new features, hit schedules,

1031
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,500
and it actually means that change and that churn

1032
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,409
makes it quite difficult when you're testing new things.

1033
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:52,800
Wait, was the change the thing that we did

1034
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
to roll out the migration, or was it the new game build

1035
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,208
that they're trying some crazy new feature and it didn't

1036
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,269
quite work properly, so there was a lot to think about

1037
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,269
there. Um,

1038
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:03,619
but in doing dev first we did

1039
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,918
have a lot of confidence in the tooling,

1040
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,139
um, uh, because we kind of knew how it worked,

1041
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,639
we knew the quirks and how things were working, so

1042
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,219
um it was really worthwhile doing.

1043
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,478
Again, we picked a key set of metrics

1044
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:17,438
that were important to players, um,

1045
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,648
just to make sure that we,

1046
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,168
we knew exactly what number meant they were having a

1047
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:24,369
good experience and what number didn't, and we heavily

1048
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:26,648
indexed on those as part of all of the migration planning.

1049
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,969
um. When there was

1050
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:31,269
an issue, roll back, give us time to investigate,

1051
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:32,929
and then go again.

1052
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,239
We prescheduled all of our incidents, which

1053
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,898
might sound weird. We call them war rooms,

1054
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,239
but it just meant that for major changes and

1055
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,378
major rollouts, all of the people that

1056
00:37:42,378 --> 00:37:44,438
were there, everything was centralized in one place.

1057
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:45,898
Everyone knew what was going on,

1058
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:48,519
and it meant that we could react again really quickly if there were

1059
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,260
any challenges.

1060
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,750
And through all of this we use that for

1061
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,829
kind of super regular communications with both

1062
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,269
AWS and Respawn. Again,

1063
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,989
everyone's on the same page. Everyone knows what's happening. Everyone

1064
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,099
knows what's going out to players,

1065
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,728
especially important for things like community management.

1066
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:03,898
If we're seeing player issues in

1067
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:04,929
a certain region

1068
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,228
or the metrics are not looking quite right,

1069
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,889
everyone knows what everyone is seeing.

1070
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,760
And once we'd actually completed the maintenance for the day

1071
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,829
and we'd done that particular region or we'd done

1072
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,030
a percentage of the region, we then needed to think

1073
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,208
about what happens.

1074
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,708
You've done your thing for the day, awesome, everything

1075
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,750
went really well. Cool, we're all going home now. Well,

1076
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:27,688
no, that doesn't work. We had to make sure that there was 24/7

1077
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,070
monitoring and alerting available, so our

1078
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,409
team took over in the evening to look after

1079
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,030
those stats and metrics. Is everything still looking OK?

1080
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:37,309
That's when we talked about uh regions coming

1081
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:39,349
into peak so we could check that, oh actually

1082
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,469
no, it was totally fine once we had enough capacity

1083
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,510
online and things like that. So really, really important to think

1084
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,510
about the uh monitoring after

1085
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,429
you've done the migration.

1086
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,728
Proactive support is super key, so

1087
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,929
finding those problems before players see them. You

1088
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,570
don't want to see that post on Reddit going, Oh,

1089
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,208
Australia's broken again, what's going on?

1090
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:56,860
You want to know that beforehand.

1091
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,050
So that kind of breaks down into two things.

1092
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,750
One, having really,

1093
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,125
really fine tuned alert. On the

1094
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,425
metrics you care about, those player experience metrics,

1095
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,655
and also having amazing engineers who kind of have

1096
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,773
a bit of 1/6 sense for game problems,

1097
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:11,954
watching, being proactive, or that doesn't look quite

1098
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:14,155
right, or this trend doesn't look quite right against

1099
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:16,135
yesterday's trend. I'm going to have a quick look into this.

1100
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:17,715
So really, really important.

1101
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:20,958
And again, trying to do as much

1102
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,599
as possible before the actual migration

1103
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,800
or a problem happens with the migration, so things like

1104
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,918
run books. What are we going to do in key scenarios

1105
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:29,958
if things happen? What happens if this region

1106
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,159
fails? Well, we're going to do this, this and this, and everyone's thought about

1107
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,199
that plan in advance. Again,

1108
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,519
it gives you much, much quicker time to respond.

1109
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,909
Escalation parts for each part of that stack

1110
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,000
and that service, who's responsible for what, who

1111
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,840
are we going to get hold of if, if it's broken.

1112
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,438
One of the key things we worked on early on was

1113
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,929
having great relationship between partners. If we need

1114
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,010
to get a hold of the game lift service team, how are we going to do that?

1115
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,639
If we need to get hold of someone in Jared's team or

1116
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:55,769
someone on the cables side, how are we going to talk

1117
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,809
to each person and how are we going

1118
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:59,809
to get a hold of each other? It might seem a

1119
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,889
bit silly, but it's not always the thing you

1120
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:04,360
think about when you're kind of working up to a big migration.

1121
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,728
So those little things make huge differences

1122
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,128
in terms of time for response, which means

1123
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:11,250
player pain or lack of hopefully.

1124
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:14,829
And one weird little learning we did find,

1125
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:16,289
severities and priorities.

1126
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,610
P0 does not mean P0 to

1127
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,728
everyone. Sometimes people call it P1, sometimes

1128
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:23,148
people call it P0, so kind of early on

1129
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,250
aligning on what was important and what

1130
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,489
wasn't, so that everyone goes, if someone calls out a P0,

1131
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,840
everyone's like, right, we're all on it,

1132
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,159
there's a big problem here,

1133
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,110
rather than a misunderstanding. So kind of knowing

1134
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,829
when the problems are going to happen, really, really critical.

1135
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:39,000
Um, one of the great things we built as part of all

1136
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,199
of this was really, really strong links into the Game lift

1137
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:41,840
engineering team.

1138
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,478
Uh, we share updates, issues we're seeing, problems

1139
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,478
they're having, and we get really good feedback from them as

1140
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,760
well, which ultimately leads to better

1141
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,300
support for everyone,

1142
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,878
including, you know, having their engineers on call

1143
00:40:51,878 --> 00:40:54,039
and being able to jump on a call at 3 o'clock

1144
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,019
in the morning to fix a problem is really, really critical.

1145
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,898
So, um, Jared, a little bit about you and

1146
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:02,559
what we actually saw as part of the migration then.

1147
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,019
Alright, thank you, uh, I'm Jared.

1148
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,449
I'm the head of tech for Apex Legends.

1149
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:11,260
Uh, been at Respawn for,

1150
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,579
uh, just over 2 years now. Uh, before this,

1151
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:15,750
I was at Riot Games for about 7 years.

1152
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,179
I've been running tech for Team Fight Tactics

1153
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:19,199
when I left Riot, and

1154
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,619
before that I also ran, uh, tech for Wild Rift,

1155
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:23,119
which is their illegal mobile product. So

1156
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:24,679
been in Life Service Games for a bit now.

1157
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:27,898
Um, coming in to respawn and

1158
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,750
taking a look at what we had, um,

1159
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,199
one of the things I really wanted to make sure we had

1160
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:32,780
was,

1161
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,530
uh, this hyper focus on,

1162
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,898
hey, if we're gonna be moving our game servers off to something,

1163
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,800
uh, new,

1164
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,199
player experience is the most important thing, um, obviously

1165
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,199
cost and some other factors way, way, way into that,

1166
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,478
but, um, I needed to make sure that.

1167
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,559
Our players were not going to be impacted in a way that was negative.

1168
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,679
Ideally they wouldn't even notice, at least on the day

1169
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,780
of migration,

1170
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:54,478
um, and it couldn't impact our ability to to

1171
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,059
deliver our our seasonal content. So we're live

1172
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,429
service game. We're constantly making new changes.

1173
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,898
It is a struggle

1174
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,389
endlessly to get content out the door, get

1175
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,728
that patch out the door. We couldn't have a migration

1176
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,478
impact something that was gonna be connected to the features

1177
00:42:08,478 --> 00:42:10,458
and marketing that we were gonna be putting for our players,

1178
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,760
um, so we're looking for someone that our people

1179
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,679
actually can help us with, with, with that.

1180
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:17,179
So that partnership between Reese Swan, AWS,

1181
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,079
and Code Wizards was, was, was key.

1182
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,478
Um, very early on I could tell that they got it.

1183
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,780
They understood what was important to us. They were willing to

1184
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,918
put the time and effort into,

1185
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,579
uh, proof of concept, making sure that they were going

1186
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,699
through, um, all the pieces that we thought were

1187
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:30,699
really, really important.

1188
00:42:30,978 --> 00:42:33,239
Um, Ultimately it was, uh,

1189
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,360
a very long, uh, due diligence, uh,

1190
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,780
with a lot of different components and tests to make sure that.

1191
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:40,179
Um, we, we knew what

1192
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,219
we were getting into and we knew that if there

1193
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,260
were issues that were, uh, that

1194
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,280
we were going to be able to face, we had mitigations for them

1195
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,340
and we can jump into that and again, the partnership was

1196
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,378
paramount to that. I had uh trust throughout

1197
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:52,280
the entire process, especially seeing

1198
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,809
deliverable after deliverable, and then always that

1199
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:57,119
focus on player experience. It just matters that

1200
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:00,000
our players, you know, have the experience that

1201
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,659
we need for them.

1202
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:04,398
The most impressive thing was that migration.

1203
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,199
There was zero player impact.

1204
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:07,280
Players

1205
00:43:07,898 --> 00:43:10,110
moved on to the next infrastructure.

1206
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:11,918
It just kind of happened behind the scenes for them,

1207
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,760
and we were able to just do it region by region in a very,

1208
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,559
very careful and methodical way,

1209
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,219
which again players didn't

1210
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:22,239
notice, but they did notice the other side of that,

1211
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:22,918
which I'll talk to you.

1212
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,159
Thank you. So

1213
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,159
Not only did they not notice that the migration

1214
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:34,219
happened, what they did start to feel

1215
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,300
was the performance increase that

1216
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,918
we were seeing here, so.

1217
00:43:38,898 --> 00:43:41,059
Pre pre-migration we're

1218
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:43,000
tracking a metric here that you can see on the screen.

1219
00:43:43,378 --> 00:43:44,260
This is the um.

1220
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:45,309
The

1221
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:47,849
percent of matches that have a game server degradation, so

1222
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:50,010
something that a player feels that just feels a little

1223
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,090
off, it could be hit registration, it could be a rubber banding,

1224
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,168
slow mo. There's a lot of different factors kind of

1225
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:54,840
play into that,

1226
00:43:55,148 --> 00:43:57,309
uh, but it's a metric we care a lot about because ultimately

1227
00:43:57,489 --> 00:43:59,530
when players say fix your servers, they're

1228
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,530
really saying, hey, I had a bad experience and

1229
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,228
it was something to do

1230
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,188
in any type of of of those type of uh KPIs.

1231
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,789
Um, so what we saw post migration was

1232
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,610
a dramatic drop off in in those degradations,

1233
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:12,500
which is phenomenal. So not only did we.

1234
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:13,969
Uh, moved through the migration,

1235
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,530
saw the zero player impact,

1236
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:18,059
um, we started to see the positive benefits that we were hoping

1237
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,219
for, um,

1238
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,530
in addition to that.

1239
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:23,539
Not only do we have um the the game

1240
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:24,478
servers themselves,

1241
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,530
our players are globally distributed. We're

1242
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,619
always looking at where our populations are and

1243
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:31,398
we're always looking at ways that we can optimize

1244
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,878
what a player experience in any given region could be.

1245
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,320
And with game lift and code reserves we're able to

1246
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,648
target regions. We could look at different spots.

1247
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:39,239
We can see,

1248
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,769
oh, it might make sense to move. Some players from this region

1249
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:43,289
co-populate them over here.

1250
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:45,878
We didn't have that flexibility before and that's really, really

1251
00:44:45,878 --> 00:44:47,539
important for us when we think about where we are today,

1252
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:50,280
but where we're going, um, because the game is evolving.

1253
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,500
We're always getting new players and we're always looking to see

1254
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,878
how can we make the experience globally consistent

1255
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:55,860
for all of our players.

1256
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,599
Um, the other side of this is

1257
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,128
we're

1258
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:00,599
constantly updating the game.

1259
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,030
And in doing so we're constantly introducing

1260
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,590
new features, new capabilities,

1261
00:45:05,898 --> 00:45:08,030
and that's great for players from having cool

1262
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:08,898
new things to do,

1263
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:11,329
but it also means that we have a strain that we're putting back

1264
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,289
onto the game servers. Every new thing we do

1265
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,688
could have a performance impact

1266
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:17,148
with the partnership with the

1267
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:19,148
telemetry we have and the ability to see what's happening in

1268
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:21,228
production. We're able to get in front of those

1269
00:45:21,228 --> 00:45:23,269
things, put a feature out, have

1270
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:25,625
confidence that it's going to. Form to the uh to the

1271
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,695
experience that we're looking for, um, and it can really

1272
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:29,985
lean into the partnership in terms of responding

1273
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:31,985
to those things so we can go back and upgrade

1274
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:34,224
a feature if we need to or optimize it, but uh

1275
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:36,264
it's been really, really important for us to be able

1276
00:45:36,264 --> 00:45:37,003
to not only,

1277
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:39,385
uh, take what we had before, move to this new

1278
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:41,465
system, but now we look to the future and we're talking

1279
00:45:41,465 --> 00:45:43,704
about really, really cool new player experiences, and

1280
00:45:43,704 --> 00:45:45,824
I have the confidence that we're gonna have the game server infrastructure

1281
00:45:45,824 --> 00:45:46,503
behind it to do it.

1282
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,438
With that said, I'll give it back to Tom.

1283
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,320
Yeah, thanks, Gerald. And to be honest, as an

1284
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,800
engineer, it's so awesome to see that kind of feedback

1285
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,000
when, uh, players actually start having a better

1286
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,860
experience. You're like, yes, we did it. It worked.

1287
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:04,349
Um, so we all know that the real

1288
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:06,510
work begins post migration, right? We've done a cool

1289
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,668
thing, awesome, it worked, and we're seeing what we need

1290
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:10,668
to. But, um, in the world of games,

1291
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:11,809
nothing ever stands still.

1292
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:15,309
So we've fallen into a really cool workflow, um,

1293
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:17,458
with, with Gamelift and respawn post-migration,

1294
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,550
which usually is we've identified

1295
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,590
a problem or issue for a customer or even

1296
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,628
a developer, right? I don't know how to fix the

1297
00:46:23,628 --> 00:46:25,708
game because I don't have the stat I need or I

1298
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:28,208
don't have this metric or I, I can't see visibility.

1299
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,579
Um, what usually happens is we build a quick

1300
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,579
tool to solve the problem or, or, uh, a

1301
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:33,679
thing in the infrastructure.

1302
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,219
Um, what's great is we then feed

1303
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:37,958
that back into the game lift service team.

1304
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,320
They look at how they can build that directly into the product.

1305
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,780
They look at how they can, uh, make it work for all

1306
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,860
customers and make it a bit more hardened and

1307
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,969
rock solid, um, and then they ship it out as a

1308
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:49,099
feature. So that's been a really lovely workflow

1309
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:50,139
for us because it means that

1310
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,300
the product improves,

1311
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:53,699
everyone wins, um, and we can still

1312
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:55,699
respond really, really quickly to players as well, which is so

1313
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:56,320
critical.

1314
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:58,179
Itterration is awesome.

1315
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,559
So a cool few things we've managed to

1316
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:02,780
deliver post launch already.

1317
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
new regions including local zones, as Jared said,

1318
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:07,878
kind of really adapting where players are playing

1319
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:09,099
and what's going to be best for them.

1320
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,239
Adding custom tooling to find those slow-mo

1321
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:14,239
servers, um, hit registration,

1322
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,599
all those things are so critical with a game like Apex,

1323
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,760
so being able to find and pinpoint and understand

1324
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,039
why that happened, uh, just means more visibility,

1325
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,780
more monitoring, so we worked a lot on that.

1326
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:26,110
Adding extra tooling for respawn engineering

1327
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,349
to kind of get more debugging information when we

1328
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:30,829
have that slow moll or that hit reg issue, how

1329
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:32,829
we, uh, what happened in the code, what

1330
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:34,909
was going on? Was it infrastructure? Was it the code

1331
00:47:34,909 --> 00:47:36,070
itself? Was it the new feature?

1332
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,628
Really, really difficult to pinpoint that. So being able

1333
00:47:38,628 --> 00:47:40,840
to dive in there really quickly, um,

1334
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:41,929
is really important.

1335
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,539
Um, and then finally we did also do some cost

1336
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:46,539
reductions, so being able to kind of make the

1337
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:48,579
infrastructure more cost effective, which just

1338
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:50,579
means that that money can get plowed back into players

1339
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,840
and on the experience, um, uh,

1340
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:54,239
again, so, so critical.

1341
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:58,168
So, we told you at the beginning that we were going to do

1342
00:47:58,168 --> 00:48:00,360
a migration. What did we learn as part of that? Well,

1343
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,978
the big things, low test, test and test and

1344
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:05,438
more, right? Think about those three different types of testing,

1345
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:07,938
um, and each of them tells you a different

1346
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:10,119
thing, but be really confident in your infrastructure.

1347
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:12,860
Invest heavily in observability and metrics,

1348
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:15,378
especially anyone that tells you about player

1349
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:17,458
experience. So what are those metrics that are

1350
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:18,739
really key for your players?

1351
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:21,340
Make sure you have those and you're really, you really

1352
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,239
understand what they look like.

1353
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:25,610
No big bangs, and what I mean by that is

1354
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,728
have real fine

1355
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,510
fine control over what you roll out and

1356
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,668
roll back in production.

1357
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:33,030
So don't have this big, hey, we did a migration, we moved

1358
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,148
every single region at the same time, oh look, it all

1359
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:35,708
fell over.

1360
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,110
Be really, really careful and considerate with how

1361
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,820
we're moving traffic so that you can measure,

1362
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:42,010
respond, move back if you need to.

1363
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,590
And then finally, think about the teams that

1364
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,590
are working on this stuff. Build a tight team that really

1365
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,750
cares. If that's a a third party service

1366
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,090
provider or if it's in your own team.

1367
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:52,619
Um, make sure everyone really

1368
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:54,639
understands the challenge you're solving and why you want to solve it,

1369
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:56,780
and that they're passionate about solving it, because if you've

1370
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,878
got that, you're going to do things

1371
00:48:58,139 --> 00:48:59,320
much better and much quicker.

1372
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:02,800
So thank you all for attending. Um,

1373
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,648
we were so proud of this migration and the

1374
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:07,878
and the and the things that we built here. Um,

1375
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,250
if you can please um fill out the

1376
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,289
session survey in the mobile app, that would be brilliant for us.

1377
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,648
And if anyone wants to talk about game servers, migrations,

1378
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,769
or anything, we'll be hanging around for about half an hour afterwards.

1379
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:19,050
Just come and chat to us, we're more than happy to. Thanks

1380
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:19,429
for your time.
