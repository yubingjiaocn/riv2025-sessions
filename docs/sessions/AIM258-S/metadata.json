  "abstract": "When bringing generative AI applications to production, accuracy is key. LaunchDarkly's AI Configs give you the flexibility to change your generative AI applications at runtime, so you can measure model performance more effectively in a real-world setting. In this session, we'll walk through a simplified RAG implementation of an insurance chatbot using an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. You'll see a demo of how this chatbot uses LaunchDarkly AI Evals to detect hallucinations in production. We'll also cover how to collect metrics such as latency and cost, and discuss strategies for building guardrail logic directly into your runtime configuration. This presentation is brought to you by LaunchDarkly, an AWS Partner.",
