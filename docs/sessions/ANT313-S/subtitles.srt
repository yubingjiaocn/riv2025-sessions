1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,690
- Hey, good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,670
and welcome to the session.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,630
My name is Sachneet

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,750
and I lead the Solutions
Architecture team at Impetus.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
Today I'll be talking about

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,570
how we are helping enterprises
unlock the GenAI potential

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,000
with automated modernization
of their legacies,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,340
the data that they have
accumulated over decades

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,753
to the AWS platform.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,710
First, about Impetus Technologies,

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,730
we are empowering the
intelligent enterprise.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,390
We are into data, cloud and
GenAI thought-leadership.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,970
Globally 3,600 plus.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,560
We are serving more than 30
plus fortune hundred customers.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,580
We are among the top AWS
services and solution partners

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,200
and we have been delivering

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
to 30 plus fortune hundred customers

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,193
with a commitment to success.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,864
We have established a
center of excellence,

20
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,910
AWS Center of Excellence at Impetus,

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,140
and that's where we are also the top

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,220
service partner as well.

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,990
We are premier tier services partner.

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,500
We are number one in
the ETL migration space.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,720
We have migrated a number of customers

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,140
from their legacies to AWS Glue.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,720
We have more than 10 plus

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,380
services and solutions
listed on AWS marketplace

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,483
and we are D2E certified as well.

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,860
Now talking about the
intelligent enterprise.

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,950
This is a portfolio of Impetus solutions

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,420
and the services portfolio.

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,260
Now starting with the data
and cloud engineering.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,460
We start with

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,860
defining and designing
the data strategies,

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,640
cloud strategies, GenAI
strategies for our customers.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,230
And for that we've also built some

38
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,060
solutions and accelerators.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,530
A data platform accelerator

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,383
that really helps jumpstart,
create data platforms.

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,530
A solution accelerator called Prism

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,200
which brings unified observability.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,090
And then we have solutions around

44
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,370
data workloads and app modernization.

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,140
I'll be speaking about that,

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,080
but starting from, you know,
creating those strategies,

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,110
whether that's cloud
data or GenAI strategy

48
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,180
and then putting that to implementation

49
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,520
and successfully productionizing is what

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,550
we really have expertise around.

51
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,280
We have a dedicated DevOps practice,

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,640
everything from CI/CD, AI and ML ops.

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,840
We've been delivering
that to our customers.

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,040
Things around GenAI services.

55
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,350
We also have something called GenAI Labs

56
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,350
where we really help
accelerate the design of

57
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,780
ideas and solutions for our customers.

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,900
And also helping them develop
any rack based frameworks

59
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,250
that they want to create

60
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,520
or anything that they want
to build around Agentic AI,

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,610
as well as taking care of
any AI based governance

62
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,320
that needs to be in place.

63
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,060
Now talking about GenBI services,

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,970
we've been helping our customer
in the modernization space

65
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,980
and otherwise to help, you know,

66
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,780
import their legacy BI's

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,960
to these modern platforms
leveraging GenBI,

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,660
wherein for example, if you
have thousands of reports,

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,990
you don't really have to
report or redesign all of them.

70
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,350
GenBI can take care of most
of those reports for them,

71
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,990
for you, especially the ad hoc reports.

72
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,823
And then

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,440
summarizing all this,

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,630
this is how we've been helping

75
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,460
deliver an intelligent enterprise

76
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,610
and enterprise that can
make very informed decisions

77
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,560
using the insights from the data

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,060
that they have accumulated
over all these decades.

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,690
And now let's talk about

80
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,960
how are we helping
transforming the data ecosystem

81
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,393
for it to be ready for the GenAI era.

82
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,220
Now, first start with
a survey that says that

83
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,710
90% of the leaders who are looking at,

84
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,800
you know, the GenAI space and the AI space

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,140
first want to prioritize the modernization

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,120
of the legacies that they have.

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Because they may be running
an EDW/ETL for decades.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,550
There's a lot of business
logic accumulated there,

89
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,020
so they want to prioritize.

90
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,300
And similar number of leaders

91
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,850
feel that modernizing all these data

92
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,570
and using it in the GenAI
era is the key to success.

93
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,180
And at the same time, there
is a certain percentage

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,450
that feels that there
are certain impediments,

95
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,670
certain challenges to modernization.

96
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,980
Now we are all aligned
to all these servers

97
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,920
that are out there and then
we have solved this problem

98
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,950
with our tool solution
accelerator called LeapLogic

99
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,983
that really helps accelerate
such modernizations.

100
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,460
Now before we talk about modernization,

101
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,723
the first question is,

102
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,690
how should we strategize, right?

103
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,390
What should be our
approach for modernization?

104
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,700
Should we take everything as is,

105
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,080
the decades of investments

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,790
that you have on your warehouse,

107
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,160
on your ETL, on your BA side,

108
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,760
but that was architected for
those legacy frameworks, right?

109
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,120
You cannot retrofit that
to a modern platform,

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,770
but then you, do you throw that away

111
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,730
or is there a way to
reuse that business logic?

112
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,220
And once you have made that decision,

113
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,410
there's another very important question.

114
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,850
How big is this effort?

115
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,070
Are you looking at six months on effort,

116
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,530
a one year or a two years of effort?

117
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,440
Now given let's say it's six
months on an eight months.

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,480
What happens to the
business as usual, right?

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,700
So these are some of
the important questions

120
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,560
we help answer our customers

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,210
as part of our strategy,

122
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,430
strategizing a modernization for them

123
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,193
as part of our modernization
methodology and approach.

124
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,550
So the first thing that we start with is

125
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,710
creating and using a balanced approach,

126
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,510
proposing a balanced approach,

127
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,130
which means that

128
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,130
if you have a lot of legacy
around EDW/ETL, BI analytics,

129
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,300
we feel that a balance approach around,

130
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,450
you know, taking 80% of that

131
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,820
as is, but modernizing it

132
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,500
to the target platform,

133
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,690
which is pattern based transformation.

134
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,430
Now there could be 20% of it,

135
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,110
which could be the technical debt

136
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,170
that may need let's say
rewrite or engineer,

137
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,420
but we have seen this 80-20 rule

138
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,093
works very well for most
of the legacies out there.

139
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,170
And then comes the methodology part.

140
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,120
So what you see on the screen is

141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
the methodology we use.

142
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,650
On the left hand side are
some of the popular legacies

143
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,483
we support today.

144
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,987
So you'll see EDWs, ETLs,

145
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,500
analytics, Hadoop, all that.

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,210
On the right hand side you'll see

147
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,340
some of the services on AWS side

148
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,400
where we are able to migrate
all these legacies to

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,650
and that to in an automated fashion.

150
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,440
In the center you'll see
the four step methodology.

151
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,150
The first one is assess.

152
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,860
So this is the most critical part

153
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,130
because this is where we
strategize the modernization.

154
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,710
So what we do is, we
look at your legacies,

155
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,580
we assess them

156
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,610
and there are some key
insights we extract out.

157
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,750
First.

158
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,800
What is the overall score?

159
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,180
What are the volume metrics?

160
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,230
Second.

161
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,970
Well, how complex is the business logic

162
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,890
that's contained out there?

163
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,723
Third.

164
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:48,930
What is the technical debt?

165
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,870
If an EDW has been running
there for 20 years,

166
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,330
there must be a lot of
technical data out there.

167
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,580
The technical, that could
be the business logic,

168
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,890
the technical that
could be the data around

169
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,200
or the technical that
could be the complexity

170
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,090
of the business logic itself.

171
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,980
We are able to extract that out.

172
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,813
Fourth.

173
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:07,290
We are able to do a lineage

174
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,450
and dependency analysis of everything

175
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,270
you are running on your
legacy ecosystem today,

176
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,247
which essentially means is,

177
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,030
we are able to create a mapping

178
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,203
from your orchestration to ETL,

179
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,490
to your EDW and then to the BI

180
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,370
and end-to-end lineage
and dependency analysis.

181
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,470
And using all this information,

182
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,150
we are able to come up with

183
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,800
the right strategy for you,

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
right timelines for you,

185
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,280
right target architecture for you,

186
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,770
and also the right recommendations for you

187
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,540
as part of the modernization.

188
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,360
So once we have defined the
right strategy and approach,

189
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
the second step is the
transformation itself.

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,190
Now this is where the magic happens

191
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,580
because the tool is able to auto transform

192
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,000
90 to 95% of your legacy code

193
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,370
into the modern AWS platform,

194
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,220
which essentially means is if
you're running an Informatica

195
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,250
or a data stage or a Teradata or an Oracle

196
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,370
and you wanna move that to
Glue and Redshift combination,

197
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,010
the tool will do that 90 to 95%

198
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,960
in an automated fashion for you.

199
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,060
Now there's minimal manual efforts,

200
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,320
five to 10 person

201
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,720
that's taken care by the Impetus SME.

202
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,760
So what we deliver to you is

203
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,890
a successful modernization

204
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,390
within fixed timelines.

205
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,100
So the transformation step is where

206
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,410
the most of the acceleration happens,

207
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,370
and at the same time

208
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,190
we take care of
standardization, optimizations

209
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,020
that have to be implicit.

210
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,140
The third step is the validation
part where we take care of

211
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,450
everything from cell to cell

212
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,190
based data validation,

213
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,220
as well as validating each and
every piece of business logic

214
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,870
that has been transformed.

215
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,360
And the last part is
the operationalization.

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,690
So when I say we deliver
your successful migration,

217
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,630
what I meant was that we
don't just transform the code

218
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,240
and dump the code and say a goodbye.

219
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,580
We make sure that we are
productionizing it for you.

220
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,290
And this is where the operationalization

221
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,670
comes into the picture,

222
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,110
where we make sure we are building

223
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,510
the right CI/CD processes for you,

224
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,880
any security governance processes for you

225
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
and you're able to productionize

226
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,750
your legacy code transform to the

227
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,613
AWS target platform.

228
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,120
Now this slide talks about

229
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,980
some of the automation levels we have.

230
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,800
You'll see that for most
of the EDW and ETLs,

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,590
we have very good up
to 90-95% of automation

232
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,553
already available.

233
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,790
This is the four step
methodology in more detail.

234
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,323
I've already spoken about it.

235
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,270
Now let's compare LeapLogic

236
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,590
to some of the tools out there.

237
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,050
So if you're thinking of modernization,

238
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,790
you're already into modernization phase,

239
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,150
you may have seen a
plethora of tools out there.

240
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,560
Now this is a comparison of

241
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,590
how LeapLogic is way ahead of those tools.

242
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,660
Let's talk about some of those parameters.

243
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,150
The first one is the
end-to-end automation.

244
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,410
You'll find the tools in the
industry that may do ETL or EDW

245
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,360
or Hadoop or BI,

246
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,480
but in your ecosystem you
have all of those four.

247
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,880
Now do you choose one tool for each

248
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,150
or do you do use a tool that
does everything for you?

249
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,983
This is the first.

250
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,420
So, LeapLogic does everything end to end.

251
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,860
The second one is

252
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,460
how does the transformation
actually happen, right?

253
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,400
Are these the tool just doing
a line by line conversion

254
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,790
or is it really understanding
the business logic behind it

255
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,230
and then transforming it

256
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,690
based on a pattern based transformation?

257
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,630
Again, LeapLogic really
differentiates itself

258
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,360
because it does a pattern
based modernization

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,180
and covers all the workload types.

260
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,500
The third one.

261
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,010
How do you do interdependency and lineage?

262
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,940
If you have a EDW that's
running for two decades,

263
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,130
you cannot really transform that in once.

264
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,750
You cannot boil the ocean altogether,

265
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,580
you'll have to break it down.

266
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,200
But how do you break it down, right?

267
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,360
You cannot break it down
without any intelligence.

268
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,960
You need to figure out how
is the dependency mapped.

269
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,150
This is where again LeapLogic

270
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,150
differentiates because it has
all that end-to-end mapping

271
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,240
to plan a phase wise migration plan

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,340
versus a very dumb

273
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,420
chunking of your scope of
work for modernization.

274
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,360
Then the fourth one is the
kind of automation it brings.

275
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,940
With 90 to 95% of automation,

276
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,510
it really, really accelerates
the modernization.

277
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,660
Then what kind of
validation do we support?

278
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,850
A cell by cell validation ensures that

279
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,480
we are doing a validation
to the most granular level.

280
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
The tools out there do not
go to that granularity.

281
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,770
Then is it customizable
for the enterprise level?

282
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,380
Let's say you are using
some custom frameworks.

283
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,460
Can we output?

284
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,720
Can we generate the code

285
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,850
according to those frameworks or not?

286
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,230
Yes, LeapLogic can.

287
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,630
But do all the tools out there do that?

288
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,680
No.

289
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,570
Then how do we make sure that

290
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,250
we are adhering to all the SLAs

291
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,740
and delivering the performance

292
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,450
to you on the target platform?

293
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,550
LeapLogic ensures that because

294
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,080
while it does the transformation,

295
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,410
it ensures that all the
optimizations are implicit

296
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,270
and finally

297
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,210
ensuring a risk-free migration with

298
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,180
zero disruption to your
business as usual because

299
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,880
it has all that linears dependency mapping

300
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,410
and it is very well planned.

301
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,570
So this is what differentiate LeapLogic

302
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,370
from all the tools out there

303
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,953
ensuring that you have
a successful migration.

304
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,910
Now how does that really help

305
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,280
in the GenBI space as well, right?

306
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,300
I spoke about that.

307
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,700
Other than the EDW/ETL you are running,

308
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,860
we also support BI tools.

309
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,390
You may be running, let's say Tableau,

310
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,640
you may be running some other BI tools

311
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
and you wanna modernize that,

312
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,850
but you want to leverage GenBI.

313
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,860
The tool will really assess and tell you

314
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,080
what kind of patterns you run today

315
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,770
or what kind of reports you
run today on your legacy

316
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,290
and how that can be transformed
to the modern platform

317
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,910
and what GenBI can do for you.

318
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,170
For example,

319
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,030
a lot of self-serve reports

320
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,650
do not really need

321
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,020
the reports to be
converted from Tableau to,

322
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,300
let's say the AWS platform.

323
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,970
QuickSight, along with Amazon Queue,

324
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,950
could really build those
self-serve dashboards

325
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,783
for you, right?

326
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,290
Which means if you have let's say

327
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,090
5,000 self-serve reports,

328
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,490
you don't really have to
rebuild all of them, right?

329
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,190
So that's the kind of GenBI readiness,

330
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,080
the LeapLogic tool is able to bring

331
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,390
because it is able to assess and tell you

332
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,280
how GenBI can really help

333
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,873
in your reporting landscape.

334
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,890
Now finally, what's the
advantage of using LeapLogic

335
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,020
for any of those modernizations?

336
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,150
4x faster transformations.

337
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,010
2x lower cost.

338
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,770
1.5x faster validation

339
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,070
and overall compared to
any manual migration,

340
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,543
2x less effort.

341
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,440
And we have done this time and again.

342
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,740
We have done more than
200 plus migrations.

343
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,600
All successfully delivered.

344
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,810
We have transformed over a
hundred million lines of code

345
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,970
and the grammar engine today that

346
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,760
back sleep logic is so
robust that it has seen

347
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,340
most of the patterns out there in EDW,

348
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,280
EDW analytics and big data space.

349
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,010
And with up to 95% of automation,

350
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,210
it ensures that you have
at least 50 to 75% of

351
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,093
reduction in your migration
and modernization cycle.

352
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,200
Some of the case studies talking about

353
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,520
United Airlines, right?

354
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,640
They had an application
running on legacy today,

355
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,470
which really helped, you know,

356
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,230
provide customers with
realtime information.

357
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,750
But since it was running on legacy,

358
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,250
it was really slow.

359
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,330
We modernized that using
LeapLogic to the AWS platform

360
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,240
and ultimately delivered 70% effort

361
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,850
and 22% time savings for them.

362
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,210
It was a Teradata migration to Redshift

363
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,640
that we really accelerated
through LeapLogic

364
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,150
and ultimately for that
application itself,

365
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,080
United Airlines was actively
able to reduce 50% wait time

366
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,550
for their passengers

367
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,550
and 50% increase in the bookings as well.

368
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,630
So we did not really just
deliver an accelerated migration,

369
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,450
but also brought a a lot of business value

370
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,710
for United Airlines.

371
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,480
Similarly for American Express

372
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,250
Teradata, Ab Initio migration,

373
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,110
the application that they were running,

374
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,050
we transformed that with
over 70% automation.

375
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,210
I like to also talk about

376
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,790
how we helped Bank United

377
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,160
with their reporting challenges.

378
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,750
So the challenge was that the data

379
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,050
that they were bringing was
taking more than 12 hours

380
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,580
to be ready for reporting,

381
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,960
which was defeating the purpose

382
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,603
of making informed and timely decisions.

383
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:29,970
With LeapLogic, we did the assessment,

384
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,130
we came up the modernization approach

385
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,410
and we not only delivered

386
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,690
the transformation and the modernization

387
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,660
with 85% automation and acceleration,

388
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,150
but we delivered efficiencies

389
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,820
that the time that it
was taking on legacy,

390
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,110
more than 12 hours,

391
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,820
we were able to reduce that

392
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,160
by almost more than 50%

393
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,780
and they were able to make

394
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,030
informed decisions in a timely fashion.

395
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,000
So this is the kind of
transformational impact

396
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
we have been able to
bring to our customers.

397
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,373
Now,

398
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,160
we've also come up with a new accelerator,

399
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,993
a new product.

400
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:08,430
So LeapLogic does the
transformation modernization,

401
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,140
it really accelerates that.

402
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,240
But once you have moved to the cloud,

403
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,650
how do you make sure that

404
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,820
you are continuously optimizing your cost,

405
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,690
at the same time you are
getting a unified view of

406
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,900
your cloud spend as well
as our observability,

407
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,580
a unified observability.

408
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,550
This is where we have
come up with with Prism,

409
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,850
which is industry's
first AI enabled solution

410
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,830
for unified observability.

411
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,230
So it does a number of things.

412
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,990
First one, it'll give
you a unified view of

413
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,270
multi-cloud and data platforms.

414
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,977
So if you're using let's say AWS

415
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:46,500
and you're also using
some data platforms like

416
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,920
Databricks or Snowflake or
maybe also using multi-cloud,

417
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,900
you don't have to go
to different dashboards

418
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,310
to see what you are running and

419
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,230
what costs you are incurring.

420
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,800
You will get one unified
view for it through Prism.

421
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,910
That's one.

422
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,743
Second.

423
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,340
It is AI powered

424
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,070
and it has predictive analytic insights,

425
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,150
which means is which,

426
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,530
what it means is that

427
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,740
the observability insights
that it will bring to you,

428
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,500
it'll also make some
predictive recommendations.

429
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,170
It'll tell you that there
are certain anomalies

430
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,990
that should be sorted out and
how they should be sorted.

431
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,230
It'll also come up with
recommendation around the spend.

432
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,390
It'll tell you where you are spending

433
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,400
and why you are spending that

434
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,950
and what is the approach to optimize that.

435
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,050
So, and it is all AI based.

436
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,750
And the last one is the
intelligence automation

437
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,490
and the governance that it brings.

438
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,780
What that means is

439
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
that it has an ML driven
forecasting for you.

440
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,730
You are anticipating some good growth

441
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,830
on your cloud data platforms,

442
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,860
but how do you really quantify that

443
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
based on historical data
or what you're doing today?

444
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,790
So Prism can really come
up with that AI based,

445
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,040
very informed forecasting for you.

446
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,500
It also has the ability of smart tagging,

447
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,210
which means you may be running

448
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,760
hundred of applications on a cloud.

449
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,220
How do you know which
application is consuming

450
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,960
what kind of resources?

451
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,390
So you can do smart tagging through Prism

452
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,190
and the dashboard, the single dashboard

453
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,240
that you will have

454
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
will tell you that this
particular business group

455
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,090
or this application is
actually running these services

456
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,670
and this is the kind of
cost that you're incurring.

457
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,840
And finally,

458
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,517
it also has the ability of,

459
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:27,360
you know, making the
recommendations for you

460
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,210
across applications but with intelligence,

461
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,270
which means is, you may
be running an EC2 instance

462
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,400
that is costing you too much,

463
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,830
but rather than, you
know, in a dumb way coming

464
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,950
and saying, "Hey, reduce
the size of this EC2",

465
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,780
the tool is aware that you are running

466
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,810
a very mission critical
application on this EC2.

467
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,160
You cannot just bring it down

468
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,170
or you cannot just
bring the down the size.

469
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,300
So the recommendations that you get

470
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,090
are very application
aware and intelligent.

471
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,540
So this is the kind of
value at Prism also brings.

472
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,950
So if you've already modernized

473
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,513
or you're modernizing to cloud,

474
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,420
Prism is a tool that
you really need because

475
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,540
this is what will ensure
a unified observability

476
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,790
and dashboarding for you.

477
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,450
With that, I'd like you to invite,

478
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,270
like you to visit our booth 1553.

479
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,930
We'll happy to speak about Prism in detail

480
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,316
or LeapLogic in detail or GenAI and BI.

481
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:24,240
We'll love to discuss

482
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,400
where you are on your modernization space

483
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,820
or what you are doing on
the GenAI or GenBI space.

484
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,220
At the same time, we'll love

485
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,053
you to we,

486
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:35,220
we're hosting our event today

487
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,410
and we'll like to invite you.

488
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,670
Please do visit our booth.

489
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,430
We'll love to have a chit
chat over some drinks with you

490
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,590
and speak about the
modernization and others.

491
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,060
We also have this here,

492
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,280
so we'll love to distribute and have you

493
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,100
come along to the party
and have some chitchat

494
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,290
and some conversations
around modernization

495
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,313
and GenAI with you all.

496
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:55,983
With that, thank you for time. Thank you.
