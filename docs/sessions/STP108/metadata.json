  "abstract": "This session introduces Baby Dragon Hatchling [BDH], a post-Transformer architecture designed to solve the core barrier faced by today’s AI: its inability to generalize over time. Join to learn how BDH, based on a scale-free biologically inspired network, has overcome the static nature of traditional LLM models. In this talk, we will showcase how next-generation AI systems built on BDH can adapt continuously from experience while providing inherent interpretability and compute efficiency. You will understand the future of LiveAI™, and leave with a framework for how this new paradigm creates critical cost, efficiency, adaptability and performance advantages.",
  "abstract_cn": "本次会议介绍Baby Dragon Hatchling [BDH]，这是一种后Transformer架构，旨在解决当今AI面临的核心障碍：无法随时间推移进行泛化。加入我们，了解基于无标度生物启发网络的BDH如何克服传统LLM模型的静态特性。在本次演讲中，我们将展示基于BDH构建的下一代AI系统如何从经验中持续适应，同时提供固有的可解释性和计算效率。您将了解LiveAI™的未来，并掌握这一新范式如何创造关键的成本、效率、适应性和性能优势的框架。",
