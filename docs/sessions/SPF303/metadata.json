  "abstract": "Explore the innovative NASCAR fuel estimation technology developed by AWS PACE Prototyping Team for Prime Video's race broadcasts. This initiative aimed to bring broadcast innovation through our new fuel tool to the inaugural race series on Prime Video. We'll demonstrate how the solution processes streaming telemetry data from the cars (which contains no direct fuel information) and applies both mathematical and machine learning models to 3-second intervals of the data to estimate fuel levels. Discover how real-time fuel metrics are visualized, enabling broadcasters to deliver strategic race insights. Before the series launch on Prime Video, the race fuel prediction system was extensively tested during several live races as no ground truth data was available. It achieved remarkable results with accuracy and latency, utilizing fuel consumption rate machine learning model.",
