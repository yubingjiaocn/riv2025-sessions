  "abstract": "Great ideas are often a glitch in the system – a deviation from the plan.  Workflows, meetings, and even code are often designed to reward the predictable, silencing the very thinking that leads to real discovery.  This talk highlights using one system to challenge another—with Generative AI as the “translator” for unconventional thought—to create a space where atypical ideas are essential to creating and sustaining market value.  We’ll explore how AWS solutions can help identify the brilliant glitches in your own organization – inviting the voices you haven’t heard to build the future you haven’t yet imagined. This presentation is brought to you by Deloitte, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "伟大的想法往往是系统中的故障——是对计划的偏离。工作流程、会议，甚至代码通常被设计为奖励可预测性，从而压制了真正导致发现的思维方式。本次演讲重点介绍如何使用一个系统来挑战另一个系统——将生成式人工智能作为非常规思维的\"翻译器\"——创造一个空间，让非典型想法成为创造和维持市场价值的关键。我们将探讨AWS解决方案如何帮助识别您自己组织中的卓越故障——邀请您尚未听到的声音来构建您尚未想象的未来。本演示由AWS合作伙伴德勤提供。",
