00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:01,989
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,139
All right. Yeah, I was like, this is after lunch,

3
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:08,198
so, you know.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,819
Um How many of you

5
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:12,679
are in a

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,710
product owner,

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,260
product, you know, manager

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,958
roles? Can I get a show of hands, please?

9
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:19,760
All right.

10
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,059
And how many of you are in,

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,760
say, engineering roles?

12
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,449
Got it. We've got a good mix here.

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,809
So this story would sound familiar.

14
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,568
Let's say you're a product owner

15
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,700
and

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,340
You wanted to make

17
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,929
Your end users.

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,798
Or you want to empower your end users with

19
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:41,880
data-driven decisions.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,009
You pull a bunch of metrics,

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,750
go to your engineering teams.

22
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:48,189
Engineering team

23
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:50,848
builds an awesome dashboard using some visualization

24
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,639
libraries.

25
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,590
You launch it to your users,

26
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:54,889
wow, they love it.

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,719
But then

28
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,289
they ask for more.

29
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,319
Hey, Can

30
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,739
I get you to add the year over year

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,838
metrics also? Can I get you to

32
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:07,778
add Churn?

33
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:09,540
Can I bring my own data?

34
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:12,260
Can I just talk to the data?

35
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:14,290
I don't want to bug you

36
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,349
Hi. My name is Shekhar Kopuri.

37
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,650
I am one of the leaders.

38
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,819
Managing product in

39
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,349
QuickSweet.

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,069
And

41
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:28,558
I built

42
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:31,489
And run with Quicksight,

43
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,588
which is the business intelligence and analytics

44
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:35,448
capabilities

45
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:36,930
within QuickSuite.

46
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:39,400
And today,

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,609
With my colleague Jose,

48
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,219
we're gonna show you

49
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,569
how you can extract value.

50
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,010
Out of Quicksight

51
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,909
by using it in embedded modes.

52
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,088
We also have our esteemed guest, Kirtan

53
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,629
from Moody's, who's gonna walk you through

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,549
a successful embedding implementation

55
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:01,650
of Quicksight.

56
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,299
So, we're gonna talk about some capabilities

57
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,769
of Quicksight.

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,819
We're going to talk about

59
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,669
What you can do by

60
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,899
using Quicksight in embedded uh embedded

61
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,490
setting. Caton's journey

62
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,429
And then we are also going to touch upon some of the

63
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,580
new capabilities that we launched literally

64
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,490
8 weeks ago

65
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:23,800
in Amazon Quick Quick Set.

66
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,479
Yeah, the tongue twisters keep going happening.

67
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,649
So what is Amazon Quick Seed?

68
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,319
It is

69
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,439
AI native agentic

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,449
platform.

71
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,689
That allows you to unify

72
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,689
all of your data,

73
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,360
structured and unstructured,

74
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,909
your entire enterprise's

75
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,210
corpus of knowledge

76
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,808
into a single space.

77
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,710
It then allows you to

78
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,169
extract insights from it.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,278
And then translates those insights.

80
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,129
Into actions

81
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,610
and all within the framework

82
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,210
of

83
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:06,349
governance.

84
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:08,288
Security,

85
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,929
observability,

86
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,689
because it lets you then.

87
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,008
Understand the business value you're extracting.

88
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:16,960
Out of the platform

89
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:19,960
Quicksight.

90
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,729
Is

91
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,088
a unified BI.

92
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,479
Experience,

93
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:28,639
set of capabilities

94
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,020
within Quick Sweet.

95
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,229
Where you can build interactive dashboards.

96
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,219
Or pixel perfect reports, or even

97
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,580
have conversational analytics.

98
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,199
To build dashboards,

99
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:45,580
you can connect.

100
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,808
All your traditional data sources, be

101
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:49,389
it,

102
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,929
you know, relational databases,

103
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,110
data lakes,

104
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,860
And then you can use AI to author

105
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,819
these dashboards,

106
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,000
whether

107
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:00,159
to

108
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,599
create new visuals, format visuals,

109
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,300
or say even create calculated fields

110
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,500
because you don't have to worry about remembering the syntax.

111
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,419
We have integrated

112
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:12,919
Hichhart score library into Quicksight.

113
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,420
That lets your users build a host

114
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,608
of advanced visualizations.

115
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,858
that are not only

116
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:23,910
Engaging

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,048
But really beautiful.

118
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,519
You can also

119
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,119
build pixel-perfect reports

120
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,139
with Quicksight.

121
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,500
With this,

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,059
You can push

123
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,838
business critical information

124
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,500
directly to your end users' inboxes.

125
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,548
These reports could be PDFs, Excels,

126
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:46,600
or CSVs.

127
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,399
And The entire framework

128
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,629
is built on the cloud,

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,939
which means that you don't have to manage

130
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,858
servers or installations, which is typical

131
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:58,838
to reporting.

132
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,369
You can also

133
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,298
Use

134
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,399
conversational analytics.

135
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:10,238
On the entire data, not just the structure

136
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,298
data, so

137
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,259
imagine

138
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:13,559
you have.

139
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:15,519
The traditional data,

140
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,528
along with knowledge bases, wiki

141
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,129
pages,

142
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,160
emails,

143
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,949
all of that context together.

144
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:23,809
And then,

145
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,298
in natural language query, you can ask

146
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:28,850
questions and get instantaneous answers

147
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:30,670
with the full context.

148
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,759
Quicksight and Quick Suite

149
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:37,220
is built

150
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,678
as cloud native,

151
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:41,119
serverless architecture.

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,899
Which means

153
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:45,420
that you don't have to manage.

154
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,079
Or host

155
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,379
any servers.

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,298
You don't have to deal with.

157
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,350
Hardware upgrades

158
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,519
You don't have to deal with OS patches or

159
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,449
software upgrades.

160
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,389
And with our pay per use,

161
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,309
flexible pricing.

162
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,629
You are not tied in any multiyear

163
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,689
software contracts either.

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,889
So To

165
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,309
understand the economics of quick sight.

166
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,259
There was a recent survey done by an

167
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,399
independent third party group.

168
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,259
It's called Enterprise Strategy Group,

169
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:26,000
and they. Surveyed

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,889
customers.

171
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,338
who moved on to Quicksight

172
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,199
from comparative

173
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,079
BI workloads.

174
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,269
And found that over 3 years of usage,

175
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,660
Their costs reduced by 67%.

176
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,528
But more importantly,

177
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,528
the user engagement went

178
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:45,608
all the way,

179
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,889
in some cases up to 300%

180
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,790
and a model ROI of over 300%

181
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,569
in 3 years.

182
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,559
So we set out,

183
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,420
when we are building Quick site.

184
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,629
To build a platform on the cloud.

185
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,778
So that we can

186
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:05,798
provide insights to everyone.

187
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,548
One of the key ways

188
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,028
we do that today

189
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,649
is by opening Quicksight's

190
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,548
capabilities.

191
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,149
For embedding.

192
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,298
What we are seeing with our customers.

193
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,608
Is that the embedding setup is

194
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,149
being used by both enterprises

195
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:28,100
and independent software vendors alike.

196
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:30,608
Enterprises are using.

197
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,879
The embedding setting.

198
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,358
To deploy BI capabilities

199
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,869
in exactly where their users

200
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,149
are operating in

201
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,069
for doing their day to day jobs.

202
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,108
So if it's an HR specialist,

203
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,410
it's in the HR tool. If it's a

204
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,410
marketing specialist, it's in a marketing

205
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,488
tool, right? If it's a sales

206
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,059
specialist, it's in the sales tool.

207
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,970
And ISPs are supercharging

208
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,910
their products

209
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,338
by embedding analytics into

210
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,350
their offering

211
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:03,250
and With

212
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,869
that, they see

213
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,869
higher customer satisfaction,

214
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,329
better engagement,

215
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,869
and higher retention rates.

216
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,199
In fact,

217
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,619
today, there are thousands of

218
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,149
products

219
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,869
that are being powered

220
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,528
by Quicksight in the market.

221
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,819
These range for, from products,

222
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,509
from small startups to really

223
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:27,009
uh uh established large enterprises

224
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,769
where 10

225
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,850
and thousands of users are using

226
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,869
Quicksight capabilities within one account

227
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:34,908
in an embedding setting.

228
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,200
There are

229
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,979
enterprises that are operating with.

230
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:44,399
You know, scores of business units

231
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:45,700
or there are

232
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,080
Sas companies that are offering analytics

233
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,460
using Quicksight and deploying that

234
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,178
to thousands of tenants.

235
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,190
So what is that

236
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,940
all you can do with embedding in Quicksight?

237
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,178
We allow you to embed visuals for

238
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:04,340
high traffic pages.

239
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,460
You can deploy full page

240
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,359
analytics

241
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,840
using interactive dashboards.

242
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:12,889
You can also

243
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:13,808
embed

244
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:15,000
email reports.

245
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,820
You can either use Quicksight as the

246
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,288
authoring and generation engine.

247
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,219
Or you can use Quicksight as

248
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:22,918
a full.

249
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,269
Experience stack

250
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:27,349
where

251
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,649
the users schedule their reports

252
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,048
and even the delivery of the reports

253
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,048
happens from Quicksight.

254
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,308
Many products,

255
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,989
many product managers

256
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,109
have built

257
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,428
value-added

258
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:42,529
or

259
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,509
upsell capabilities

260
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,190
by introducing

261
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,389
full self-service authoring capabilities

262
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,700
using Quicksight in their products.

263
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,570
There are companies

264
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,379
who have.

265
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,690
Bought in data sets

266
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,649
using data prep.

267
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,678
There are companies who have allowed their

268
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:06,658
end users

269
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,359
to create their own custom dashboards from scratch

270
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,109
by supplying pre or pre-formatted

271
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:12,759
data sets.

272
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,668
And all of those possibilities

273
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:17,229
exist with self-service authoring.

274
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:21,639
You can also embed natural language queries-based

275
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,428
conversation analytics independently.

276
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,109
And our dashboards

277
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,678
with anonymous embedding,

278
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,029
you can deploy them even on public

279
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,928
websites. So

280
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,389
yes, we package

281
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,629
all the analytics capabilities

282
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,428
in all these modes.

283
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,989
But why should you consider

284
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,489
using Quicksight

285
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,349
to power your analytics in your enterprise

286
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,149
or in, in your uh

287
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,969
products? One

288
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:54,529
big reason is we are built for scale.

289
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,178
We can easily scale.

290
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,058
From

291
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,320
10 to 100s of thousands

292
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,129
of users.

293
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,090
Without you having to worry about that

294
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,609
scale.

295
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,969
A second big reason

296
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,690
is that we are enterprise ready.

297
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:19,090
With the right kind of governance mechanisms

298
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,830
in place.

299
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,109
With security features like

300
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,408
RLS and column-level

301
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,710
security, low-level security.

302
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,649
With Identity propagation

303
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,710
from AWS data leaks.

304
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,450
And with

305
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,190
fine-grained access control on all

306
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,229
of your assets.

307
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:41,109
You can be assured

308
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,960
That the user

309
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,820
only gets to see the data that

310
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,899
they're supposed to see.

311
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:52,038
We also support multiple identity integrations,

312
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,210
starting with AWS IM Identity

313
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,719
Center.

314
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,830
But you can also use

315
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,558
third-party IDPs, identity providers

316
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:01,820
like Octa and Ping

317
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:03,139
through SAML.

318
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,178
You can do

319
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:06,639
direct Native

320
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,739
Active Directory integration,

321
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,298
or if you're already on IM you can

322
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,759
just use IM Federation

323
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:14,298
to manage your identity.

324
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:20,080
If you have a need to deploy

325
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,399
assets into

326
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:23,190
Thousands of

327
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,558
Tenants

328
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,668
Then we offer flexibility on how you're

329
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,479
managing that architecture.

330
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,548
If your data is already fragmented

331
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,029
by a tenant or a business unit,

332
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,379
You can use the construct of name

333
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,038
spaces

334
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,739
to completely isolate the data, the

335
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,899
consumption layers, and your users in

336
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,700
a name space.

337
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
But there are many companies where that is

338
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,519
not the situation.

339
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:55,729
And the data is not fragmented

340
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:56,989
by the tenant upfront.

341
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,009
So you can use

342
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,229
RLS and CLS rules based on tags.

343
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:04,399
Or identities

344
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,229
To then manage.

345
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,129
The tendency,

346
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,808
but then the consumption layer, which is the

347
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,808
dashboards and reports that you create and

348
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:15,548
the users

349
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,009
can be isolated into name spaces.

350
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:20,340
Or

351
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:23,710
You can actually create individual stacks

352
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,369
all the way from the account level

353
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:26,349
for each.

354
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,509
Uh, tenant.

355
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,219
And then you can manage deployment across

356
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:34,658
all of that through APIs.

357
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:37,729
In fact,

358
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,658
we have a robust set of APIs.

359
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,950
And SDK

360
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,849
that allow you to do that.

361
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,609
Our embedding SDK.

362
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:50,739
I love you

363
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,908
To embed all of those experiences that

364
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,090
we talked about before.

365
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,000
And we offer things like one-click embedding,

366
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,379
which makes it very easy

367
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,399
for the engineering teams to integrate.

368
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,538
Quicksight into your products.

369
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,690
You can also connect

370
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,729
the interactions two ways.

371
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,940
Between your host application

372
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:18,820
and Quicksight

373
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,259
to things like

374
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,029
events that you're exposing on the SDK

375
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,558
or parameters that you can push down values

376
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:26,399
into Quicksight.

377
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,658
Our APIs

378
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,418
allow you to manage deployments at scale.

379
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,469
For workflows,

380
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:37,719
Like

381
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:40,700
moving assets from lower

382
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,739
environments to higher environments or

383
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:43,298
moving,

384
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,658
like building a dashboard in one

385
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:48,178
account and deploying it across thousands

386
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:48,918
of accounts.

387
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,029
Or managing your

388
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,629
users and your roles

389
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:54,489
and groups

390
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:55,849
through APIs.

391
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,928
You can do all of that

392
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:02,369
and make

393
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,469
the experience your own.

394
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,389
With custom branding,

395
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,090
And teeming

396
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,279
With brand

397
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,428
definitions,

398
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,798
you can define your brand colors, your

399
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:14,788
brand logos,

400
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,418
and that brand gets respected across

401
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:19,139
all of the consumption layers.

402
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,599
And with theming and custom branding

403
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,239
available dynamically

404
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,908
within. The embedding SDK

405
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,908
you can actually create one experience

406
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:33,070
and deploy it

407
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,029
in multiple variants.

408
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,928
As if they are multiple avatars.

409
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,239
Based on the user or the end

410
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:43,000
end customer

411
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,609
so that you don't have to rebuild the entire experience

412
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,479
over and over again.

413
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,889
So yes,

414
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,509
You can

415
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,558
Use Quicksight

416
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,859
In a way that you can power your

417
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,038
analytical needs

418
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,519
across multiple modalities.

419
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:03,538
But you don't

420
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:04,519
have to take

421
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:06,139
our word for that.

422
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,548
Companies like NFL are using

423
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,389
all of

424
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,969
the capabilities that I just talked

425
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,070
about. In improving

426
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,090
their fan engagement.

427
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,288
With

428
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,989
products like NextGen Stats.

429
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,570
Where they're able to push near real time

430
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,269
data

431
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,330
for every player and every play

432
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,440
directly to their fans.

433
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:34,739
They're using Quicksight

434
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,609
for a product called

435
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,190
Digital Athlete,

436
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:40,149
which improves player safety.

437
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,678
In NFL Combine.

438
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,119
They build dashboards.

439
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,739
So that your fans can.

440
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:54,519
Watch

441
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,639
and interact live

442
00:16:57,158 --> 00:16:59,200
of what every player's speed

443
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,239
and strength is.

444
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,389
And they actually deployed that in NFL.com.

445
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:07,150
And with RBI acceleration engine,

446
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,969
We served that

447
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,390
entire experience flawlessly.

448
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,140
Even as fans were swarming to the

449
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,328
website. And

450
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,549
in NFL draft,

451
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,209
They built

452
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,358
A set of dashboards.

453
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,209
For every single NFL team.

454
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:29,739
And for the first time

455
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,338
in for NFL,

456
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,430
They built a conversational chat

457
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,108
called Draft IQ Assistant.

458
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:40,420
Where fans could just ask questions

459
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:43,000
and you'd get instantaneous answers

460
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,799
of what's happening.

461
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:49,199
They also use the chat agent

462
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,358
for actually building their content.

463
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,640
They integrated a bunch of

464
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:57,699
data into QuickSuite, Quicksight.

465
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,719
And then

466
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,279
their content creators started asking

467
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,739
questions. And got

468
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,239
sort of content summaries in about

469
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,368
10 to 20 seconds.

470
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,699
Previously, they would spend a couple of days

471
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:13,180
gathering all those pieces of information as

472
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,338
draft is happening

473
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,380
and build that.

474
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:17,039
All told,

475
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,299
The entire NFL combined

476
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,598
and NFL draft.

477
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,118
Uh

478
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,789
Experiences attracted

479
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:27,868
over a million

480
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,068
users, a million visitors.

481
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,000
And then there was insights that they

482
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,519
pushed.

483
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,380
To broadcast channels worldwide.

484
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:40,130
That is amazing,

485
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,750
how fast they could do all of

486
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,910
that with Quicksight's embedding

487
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,689
capabilities.

488
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:50,160
Now to walk you through another

489
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,549
successful customer journey,

490
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:53,368
let me invite Kirtan

491
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,289
from Moody's.

492
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,630
Thanks, Shekhar.

493
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,479
Uh. Hi,

494
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,739
my name is Kirtan Dave. I'm part of the product

495
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:09,598
management team at

496
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:11,588
Moody's Insurance Solution.

497
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,328
We recently launched a brand new

498
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,309
product called Risk Data Lake in which

499
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,650
we actually implemented all the

500
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,890
capabilities or most of the capabilities that Shaker

501
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,170
just walks, walked us through.

502
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,608
So we embedded Quicksight into the

503
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,838
application. To enable our clients

504
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:29,459
to build their own analytics. So in this section

505
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,318
I'll go over

506
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,858
some of the work that we did, more like what,

507
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,219
why, and how, what did we build, why

508
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,338
did we build it that way, and how did we build

509
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,420
it so that you get an idea

510
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,500
of how we approached this problem.

511
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,630
But before I go deep into this, let me first

512
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,689
give you guys an idea of what Moody's insurance

513
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,789
solution is. So if you're not familiar

514
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,910
with us, we are the market leader

515
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,348
in providing analytical solutions

516
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,750
to the insurance industry, property and casualty

517
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,608
insurance industry to help them

518
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:00,068
quantify catastrophic risk.

519
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,269
We provide models and solutions that help

520
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,769
the industry understand their exposure

521
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,390
to events like earthquakes and hurricanes

522
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,009
and other catastrophic events.

523
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,650
We provide such analytics throughout

524
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,750
the risk life cycle. So if you think about

525
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,809
the journey of

526
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,930
insurance risk, it starts from primary underwriting

527
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,390
where the risk is getting underwritten

528
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,049
for the very first time all the way to reinsurance

529
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,108
and brokers and other players in

530
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,180
between. And at every step of

531
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,299
the way, every entity is

532
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,338
trying to really understand what their

533
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:34,380
exposure is to catastrophic

534
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,180
events like earthquake and hurricane.

535
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:40,469
We deliver all these analytics

536
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,750
using persona centric applications. Some of the

537
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,789
names you see in there risk modeler,

538
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,250
Treaty IQ, And IQ, exposure IQ

539
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,430
are persona centric applications that

540
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,130
are built

541
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,469
to deliver that analytics

542
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:53,380
to our end users,

543
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:54,368
and these

544
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,108
applications are built on a platform

545
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:59,068
that we call intelligent Disk platform.

546
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,009
This platform provides infrastructure

547
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:04,489
and core set of services that these

548
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,049
applications take advantage of.

549
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,689
This platform and all these applications are

550
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,549
built on AWS technology

551
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,068
and we are the first and the only provider

552
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,598
of the cloud native platform and

553
00:21:16,598 --> 00:21:18,608
applications spanning the entire risk life

554
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:19,189
cycle

555
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,920
covering catastrophic modeling needs for

556
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,709
the property and casualty insurance.

557
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:28,890
Today we have over 100s of clients

558
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,318
using the platform and one or more

559
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:32,390
applications on the platform.

560
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,130
When we look at our clients' teams that are

561
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,608
working on the platform,

562
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,209
they consist of obviously the business users

563
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,269
in this example,

564
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,529
Jane, who could be an underwriter or

565
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:43,650
a portfolio manager.

566
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,289
Now a person like Jane looks for in-depth

567
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,410
analytics to be delivered to

568
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,568
her in a timely manner so that

569
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,689
she could then turn those insights

570
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,529
into business decisions.

571
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,420
The group that provides such analytics

572
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
to Jane are practitioners, in

573
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,559
this example, a person named John,

574
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:05,900
who works with our platform and

575
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,098
our applications on a daily basis.

576
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,809
In his role,

577
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,219
John processes a large volume

578
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:12,920
of data

579
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:15,699
and uses multiple tools

580
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,900
to turn that data into analytics

581
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,259
and insights and delivers that to

582
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,939
Jane and other business leaders.

583
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,140
In order to provide these analytics in a timely

584
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,660
manner, what John needs is scalable

585
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,739
infrastructure so that he can

586
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,239
process large volume of data

587
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,259
and provide timely insights.

588
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:37,650
In addition, there are also team members

589
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:40,059
in this example, Sarah, who perform

590
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,199
very deep research on

591
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,500
the analytics that we provide

592
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
through the platform and the application

593
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,719
as a starting point.

594
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,449
So her job is to analyze again

595
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:52,118
a very large volume of data

596
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,578
to draw insights that will

597
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,449
help Jane kind of build the

598
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,640
competitive edge in the marketplace

599
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,259
and similar to John.

600
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,068
Sarah also strives for,

601
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:06,858
you know, scalable infrastructure so that she can

602
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:09,130
process large volume of data and

603
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,729
turn them into insights.

604
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,400
So when teams that I just kind

605
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
of walked through, when they are looking to

606
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,640
advance their analytical capabilities and

607
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,949
figure out how to

608
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:22,219
kind of derive

609
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,549
advanced analytics out of large volume of data,

610
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,098
they look for solutions out in the market

611
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:30,358
and obvious solution that they land on

612
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:32,150
are data lakes where data lakes,

613
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:33,989
as most of you would know, uh,

614
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:36,098
provide all the scalable infrastructure,

615
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,640
the.

616
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:41,150
Flexibility in terms of the data, schemas

617
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,009
and all that where the data doesn't need to be

618
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:45,949
structured in a uh relational

619
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,150
database in order for John and Sarah to

620
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,088
take advantage of.

621
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,180
But as they are evaluating these data lakes

622
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,420
and try to implement that into

623
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,539
their ecosystem and

624
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,809
integrate that with their workflows, they

625
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,818
run into a slew of challenges.

626
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,939
A very common challenge that we see

627
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,019
is that the strategy that they apply

628
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,140
is, hey, let's build a data lake, let's

629
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,380
dump all the data into data lake, and users

630
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,239
will figure out

631
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,160
how to take advantage of that

632
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,949
product and get the insights delivered,

633
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,699
and that doesn't work very well in most cases.

634
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:22,170
In fact, we have seen examples after

635
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:22,709
examples

636
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,250
where that has not worked out very well.

637
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:27,578
One of our largest clients, uh,

638
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:30,130
actually spent 2 years building such

639
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,130
data lake capabilities, and

640
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,750
it has been over 1 year since that project concluded,

641
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,209
and unfortunately they are still not able

642
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,289
to take full advantage of such a data

643
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,769
lake. These are the challenges

644
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:44,088
that they run into, and we have seen

645
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:46,368
examples after examples where vanilla

646
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,789
data lake implementations struggle

647
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,009
to deliver the value that they promise.

648
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,779
This was our motivation to build

649
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,818
what we call the applied data lake or

650
00:24:57,818 --> 00:24:58,660
risk data lake.

651
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,959
This data lake builds on the data lake

652
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,039
foundation, so it brings all the

653
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,380
benefits of the data lake,

654
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,299
everything from scalable infrastructure

655
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,279
to schema,

656
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,180
you know, flexibilities and so forth,

657
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,380
but in addition,

658
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,180
it also brings domain specific

659
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,239
organization of the data and represents the

660
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:19,519
data entities not just a series of integers

661
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,739
and strings, but rather

662
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,640
domain specific concepts such as portfolio,

663
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,029
policies, and locations,

664
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,598
the concepts that make sense in the risk

665
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:30,660
management arena. This

666
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
data lake also comes with built-in

667
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,769
analytical tools,

668
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,979
everything from drag and drop reporting capability

669
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,098
that we built using

670
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,910
Quicksight as well as ability to query

671
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,939
the data using SQL and

672
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,098
for more advanced users like Sarah that we

673
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:45,880
saw earlier

674
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:48,259
to be able to use programmable

675
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:50,279
notebooks to analyze data

676
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,039
and build

677
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,180
advanced analytics.

678
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,559
We integrated risk data lake with the intelligent risk

679
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,479
platform that I covered just a few slides ago.

680
00:25:58,118 --> 00:25:59,118
And by doing so,

681
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,920
everyone on our client site, from Jane to

682
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,199
John and even Sarah, are

683
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:06,160
able to take advantage of this data lake,

684
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,130
use it

685
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:09,598
to develop and consume advanced

686
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:10,519
risk analytics.

687
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,130
So, in summary, what Risk

688
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,229
data lake is, is an extension

689
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:19,289
of the platform that we have built, which is called

690
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:20,489
Intelligent Risk Platform.

691
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,890
It comes with full integration with

692
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,930
the platform, meaning all the data that we have in

693
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,049
the platform is available in

694
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:27,910
Risk Data Lake.

695
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,809
In addition, it allows users to import

696
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,809
other data assets that they might want to

697
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:34,170
incorporate into

698
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:35,489
the analytics.

699
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,250
In terms of tools, it comes,

700
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:41,160
it covers an entire spectrum of analytical

701
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,880
tools from

702
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,368
reporting engine to ability to query

703
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,618
the data using SQL and programmable

704
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,420
notebooks with Python and R.

705
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,009
The drag and drop reporting functionality that

706
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,180
we built in Risk Data Lake

707
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,400
was built through AWS Quicksite. So

708
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,009
now let's look at how we did that.

709
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,559
So here is a screenshot of the

710
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,118
application that we built. This is an embedded

711
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:05,759
experience on the designer side.

712
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,118
Here you see kind of the core component

713
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:11,318
of our risk data lake which we call risk data

714
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:11,920
catalog,

715
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,420
where the data is cataloged as I mentioned earlier

716
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,900
in a You know, domain

717
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,098
with a domain context, so the data

718
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,140
assets that you see over there would make

719
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,430
sense to our end users,

720
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,900
and they kind of hide a lot of the

721
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,920
complexity of joining various data

722
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,449
elements to get to this level and

723
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:32,098
we build this kind of what we call visualization

724
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,239
ready data sets for

725
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,400
designers to be able to start with that

726
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:37,559
and turn them into

727
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:40,259
quick site analysis and dashboards.

728
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,170
Now, once the data is available

729
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,670
that way, using the embedded designer

730
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,769
experience that we built within our

731
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,449
application, designer can then

732
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:55,769
turn that into

733
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:58,789
various analysis and dashboards.

734
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,259
So if you think about John, our practitioner

735
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:02,108
that we saw earlier,

736
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:04,529
no longer needs to work with IT team

737
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,689
as Shaker was mentioning to to

738
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:09,170
kind of collect the data or turn that into a dashboard

739
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,209
only to then figure out, oh, now the

740
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,289
business users need a slight change to it

741
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,529
or want to slice and dice the data a different

742
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,049
way, right?

743
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,150
So in this example,

744
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,650
John would actually act as a

745
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,309
designer

746
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,670
and will design the dashboard as

747
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,309
he's getting

748
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,088
delivering that insight to

749
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,239
Jane, the business person.

750
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,959
And all this was made possible

751
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,430
thanks to the capabilities of Amazon Quick

752
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,689
Site. Now,

753
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,059
how did we implement this? So let's take a slightly

754
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,420
deeper dive into the steps we followed.

755
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,509
So as I mentioned, we have our

756
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,068
platform and persona centric

757
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,170
applications. All these applications write

758
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,309
their data into

759
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,689
the underlying common data

760
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,009
store that underpins the platform and

761
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,420
because we are on AWS,

762
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,769
uh, these are S3 buckets that we

763
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:00,890
have. Now we built

764
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,930
a risk data catalog on top

765
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,000
of this underlying data source,

766
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,368
and this is where we arrange the data

767
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:09,630
in a way that makes sense to our

768
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,328
end users.

769
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,640
But we didn't stop there. We added another layer

770
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,500
on top of it

771
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,838
to feed it into Quicksight. So

772
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,318
we built Quicksight data sets where

773
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:19,900
multiple

774
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,358
joints were performed on the RIS data

775
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,338
catalog to represent the data

776
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,358
in a ready to be visualized way.

777
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,809
And this is how the designers get access

778
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,150
to all the data sets and all

779
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,729
the underlying data for them to turn that into

780
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:37,189
dashboards and publish that for

781
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:38,108
the business consumption.

782
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:43,189
Now, as I said, we have hundreds of

783
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:43,729
clients

784
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:45,049
using our

785
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,828
platform and various applications, and

786
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,578
the way we deploy that is through a multi-tenancy

787
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:53,209
model. And so when we were integrating

788
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,250
Quicksight into our platform

789
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,509
and into Risk data lake,

790
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,949
we also had to figure out how to do

791
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:01,029
that for a multi-tenancy setup.

792
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,858
And as Shekhar mentioned, there were multiple

793
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:05,858
options that were available, and the one that

794
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:08,009
we chose was through the name space, and I'll

795
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,338
give you a bit more detail on that.

796
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,868
But yeah, so we have

797
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,289
quick site installation for every single

798
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,328
tenant out of 100s of tenants that we

799
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,068
have deployed

800
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:18,130
in production.

801
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:22,049
So, let's start how we did that. So each

802
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:22,719
tenant

803
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,739
gets a unique IM role corresponding

804
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:27,750
to a name space, as Shekhar mentioned, we,

805
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,939
we kind of took the name space approach.

806
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:33,150
Every namespace contains the tenant users

807
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,368
and security groups.

808
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,910
Access to all this data under

809
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,068
the tenant is controlled by the

810
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:39,729
security groups.

811
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,229
Now for quick site installation, we created

812
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,608
a logical folder that holds

813
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:46,729
all of the data sets.

814
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:50,328
The analysis that the designer

815
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:50,890
is building.

816
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,769
And all the dashboards and access

817
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,868
to this folder were controlled by

818
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,358
the security groups that I mentioned.

819
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,500
So now you replicate that in other

820
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,699
tenant where you would still be

821
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,818
able to kind of keep the names the same

822
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:08,979
like we didn't want to change the name of the data

823
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:11,000
sets from one tenant to another so

824
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:13,219
dashboards can become exchangeable

825
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:15,239
and so forth and we were able to achieve

826
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,439
that through this um

827
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:19,068
kind of deployment model.

828
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,170
Now, we didn't stop at just the tenant

829
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,449
level, we also had to implement low

830
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:27,368
level security.

831
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:30,140
So if you go back to the team that I was talking

832
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,400
about, John and Sarah

833
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,078
and even Jane for that matter

834
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,598
could have access to

835
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:37,939
different data assets within the

836
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,910
same tenant

837
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,500
because they belong to different business units or

838
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,479
other reasons.

839
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:45,019
And so we had to make sure that as a

840
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,098
designer is going into Relata Lake and

841
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:48,130
designing a dashboard or

842
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,219
a consumer like a business user is

843
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,420
accessing those dashboards, they can only

844
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,180
see the data that they have access to.

845
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:57,630
And the way we implemented this is

846
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,019
through the integration with the platform and this data

847
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:00,920
lake application we

848
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:03,410
pass the identity of the

849
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,410
user, whether it is a designer or a

850
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,068
consumer,

851
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:08,529
all the way down to Quicksight

852
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,900
and using Quicksight's row

853
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,209
level security feature in the data

854
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:15,250
sets that we deployed in Quicksight,

855
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:17,489
we are able to then implement

856
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:19,390
that security access layer

857
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,449
such that

858
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:22,769
users will only see the data that he or

859
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:23,729
she has access to.

860
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,539
Now think about this. Implementing such

861
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,078
granular access control in

862
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:31,279
a vanilla data lake would be

863
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:32,500
very, very difficult.

864
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:33,939
So this is how

865
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,439
we keep on adding more and

866
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:39,078
more value in RI data lake on

867
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:41,439
top of what the vanilla data lake

868
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,739
functionality provides you.

869
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,779
And again, this was made possible

870
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:47,759
because of the functionality available in Quicksight.

871
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,250
We deliver the entire quick site experience

872
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,500
in an embedded way. So what you are looking at

873
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,578
is our risk data lake application

874
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:01,239
where the designer experience is

875
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,219
fully embedded

876
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,719
within the application. So designers remain

877
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,959
in risk data lake application. They don't

878
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,358
have to go to a different application to

879
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:10,779
build the dashboard.

880
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,160
And once the designer published the dashboard,

881
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:16,118
the dashboard is made available to every single

882
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,549
application that we have in the platform.

883
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,189
So the applications that I mentioned earlier, Risk Modular

884
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:21,299
Treaty IQ 100 IQ.

885
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,828
Every single application gets all the

886
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:26,608
dashboards that were deployed

887
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:27,809
through Risk Data Lake.

888
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,618
And the reason for that is so the business users

889
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:32,719
Jane in our example

890
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,039
doesn't need to switch contexts, right? So she

891
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,328
is a regular user of RiskModeler,

892
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,380
which is our signature product, and

893
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,500
she can still remain in RiskModeler and

894
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,979
access all the dashboards that were built

895
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:45,759
through risk data lake application.

896
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,588
So this was very powerful and the reason,

897
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:52,049
one of the big reasons why we selected QuickSite

898
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,170
was because of their embeddability

899
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,328
not only on the consumption side but also

900
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:58,509
on the designer side

901
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,009
where we don't want John to go out and

902
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:03,390
talk to IT people and rely on them

903
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:05,719
to build those dashboards. He can act

904
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,630
as a designer

905
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,489
while still being in the application, build the dashboards

906
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,250
and publish them.

907
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:13,829
I hope this gives you an idea of what

908
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:16,048
we did it, how we did it, and why we

909
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:17,309
took this approach.

910
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:21,688
Now we are living in an era

911
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:24,099
where if I'm talking about some analytics

912
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,407
and I don't talk about Gen AI capability

913
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:28,768
it's kind of incomplete, right? So

914
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,427
where do we think kind of

915
00:34:31,427 --> 00:34:33,608
are taking this functionality forward now

916
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,018
Shekhar already touched upon some of them that

917
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:38,509
those functionalities are some of them are available

918
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,708
already, but we have not integrated that into

919
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,967
our application. So our vision is

920
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,579
to start integrating them into

921
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:47,588
our application as we have built it.

922
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,092
So the very. First one is what we are gonna call

923
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:52,173
talk to the dashboard, right? So if you think

924
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,954
about the business persona who was

925
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:55,603
accessing all this dashboard,

926
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:57,974
imagine she's looking at a dashboard that

927
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,992
contains real critical

928
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:02,114
information with multiple worksheets and

929
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:04,262
and all that stuff. So while that

930
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:05,393
information is very valuable

931
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,884
at the end what she's interested in

932
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:09,934
is asking some questions and trying to figure

933
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:12,043
out what the answers are, and she can do

934
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,454
that by navigating through the dashboard or

935
00:35:14,454 --> 00:35:16,454
imagine that she can just ask that question.

936
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,099
And the agent will basically

937
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,128
look at the dashboard, look at the underlying data,

938
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,878
and provide the answer.

939
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:27,148
If you take it one step further,

940
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,228
if you remember designer John,

941
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,829
what if he could build some of this

942
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,320
uh visualizations and dashboards

943
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,228
again by just

944
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,659
talking or uh in a natural language.

945
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,449
Such AI capabilities would be super

946
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,469
powerful and will revolutionize

947
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,000
how users develop and consume risk

948
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,648
analytics.

949
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:49,800
Risk data lake applications provide a

950
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,878
strong foundation for development of

951
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:54,000
such futuristic capabilities, and

952
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,820
we are looking forward to the partnership

953
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,239
with the AWS team.

954
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:00,500
To develop and integrate such capabilities.

955
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:05,708
Now, this data lake was launched

956
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,708
in October of this year, literally just

957
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,510
2 months ago.

958
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:11,159
And we started the journey of

959
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,708
integrating Quicksight into our

960
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,820
application in February of this year, so we

961
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,599
were able to

962
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:19,079
turn that around in a matter of months

963
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,378
and launch it as a

964
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:21,978
product offering.

965
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:25,820
And we are already seeing a lot of excitement

966
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,610
in the market.

967
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,989
This data lake with its current capabilities

968
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,250
and futuristic capabilities like what I just

969
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,789
covered

970
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:37,760
will democratize the risk analytics.

971
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,429
Like everyone from Jane to John and Sarah

972
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:42,449
will be able to not only process large

973
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:43,398
volume of data,

974
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,148
turn data into

975
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,489
analytics and insights, and

976
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:49,530
really achieve competitive edge in

977
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,269
the market.

978
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,148
In our industry that would mean

979
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,969
better risk selection, really understanding

980
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:57,010
what the impact of catastrophe is

981
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,329
into their exposure.

982
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,610
Jane, our business person, will be able to access

983
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,449
advanced risk analytics in a timely manner.

984
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:06,309
There are cases, especially when

985
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,809
they go through renewal cycles, they want

986
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,929
to consume more and more analytics, but

987
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,929
the time it takes to turn data into

988
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:15,050
insights is too long, especially

989
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,909
when the data is

990
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,409
too large. So she no longer needs to spin

991
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,349
up multiple

992
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,168
multi-year IT projects to make incremental

993
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:24,289
enhancements to her analytical

994
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:26,119
capabilities. She can rely on her team,

995
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,010
act as the designers to deliver these insights.

996
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,708
We are super excited about the future of risk

997
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,769
analytics and the role the risk data lake

998
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:35,579
and the intelligent

999
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,289
intelligent

1000
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,148
risk platform will play in it.

1001
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:42,030
The collaboration with the AWS team has

1002
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,110
been amazing up to this point, and we

1003
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,148
look forward to extending this partnership.

1004
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,349
So with that, I'll pass it over to Jose

1005
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:51,409
to cover the rest of it.

1006
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:01,349
Good afternoon everyone.

1007
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,860
Tough session after lunch

1008
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,369
we need coffee probably.

1009
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,780
So my name is Jose Banos. I'm a

1010
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:09,728
quick sweet

1011
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,099
go to market specialist worldwide specialist.

1012
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,878
And

1013
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,329
I brought this quote into the session and

1014
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:17,949
uh

1015
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:19,409
I would like to ask,

1016
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,809
raise your hand, your hands if your

1017
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,228
hand if you know who was uh

1018
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,329
Charles Darwin.

1019
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,739
I guess everybody, right?

1020
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,219
Otherwise I would be in a problem in the trouble.

1021
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,628
This is probably his most famous quote. It is

1022
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:34,418
not the strongest species,

1023
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,708
the one that survived,

1024
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:38,269
neither the smartest one, but the

1025
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:39,688
one with the most

1026
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,389
capability to adapt to the environment.

1027
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:43,989
And you might think,

1028
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:45,978
what is the relationship between this and

1029
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,610
Quick Sweet? Well,

1030
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:52,989
think also about companies,

1031
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:55,389
enterprise, corporations 50 years

1032
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:57,599
ago. Big

1033
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,019
corporations 40 years ago,

1034
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
they probably are not around anymore or

1035
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,438
not the leaders on the sector

1036
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:05,719
even think about shorter time

1037
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,918
10 years ago software services.

1038
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,110
They are probably not anymore around. Why?

1039
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,418
They were great. They were strong at that point, at

1040
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,148
one point in time.

1041
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,570
But maybe they were not able to adapt.

1042
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:19,269
This is a timeline.

1043
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:21,099
Of Quicksight.

1044
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,869
Quicksight has been around approximately

1045
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,719
a little bit between 8 to 9 years.

1046
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,619
And there is a key

1047
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,478
concept that you see through this

1048
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:32,039
timeline.

1049
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:35,409
Adding new functional functionalities.

1050
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:38,889
And there is one reason why we can add new functionalities

1051
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:39,699
constantly.

1052
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,909
It's because the solid foundation

1053
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:43,989
of Quicksight.

1054
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,469
It allows us to release functionalities

1055
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,519
almost every 2 weeks.

1056
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,708
But there is another key concept here.

1057
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,378
Working backwards. Have you heard about working

1058
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:55,989
backwards?

1059
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,300
I'm sure if you are working with Amazon, you have

1060
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,978
heard about that.

1061
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:02,438
90% of the features that we are

1062
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:03,599
adding to the

1063
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:06,269
Quick side and you will see that we are

1064
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,599
at some point inter uh mixing

1065
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,820
Quicksight with QuickSuite so 90%

1066
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,860
of the functionalities in Quicksight they're

1067
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,228
coming from you, from our customers,

1068
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,840
from Moody's, from

1069
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,418
all of our customers.

1070
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,648
And that reflects our desire

1071
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:23,889
to adapt to the needs of the market.

1072
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,570
Our customers and of course we also have our

1073
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,349
own roadmap,

1074
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:30,119
but most of these functionalities are coming from

1075
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,760
you. You can see if you look just at 2020

1076
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,168
we were then using uh release a Quickset

1077
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,619
Q. Providing NLQ

1078
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,820
capabilities on our dashboards,

1079
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,699
you were able in 2020 to ask

1080
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:44,239
questions using natural language

1081
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:46,239
to dashboard,

1082
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,918
but then let's continue

1083
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,099
thinking or working backwards.

1084
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,199
What we have seen

1085
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,409
and heard from our customers in the

1086
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,179
last few, uh, couple of years.

1087
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:00,750
They spend a lot of time

1088
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,789
collecting data from multiple

1089
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,610
locations using multiple analytics tools

1090
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,289
that leading to a lack of

1091
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:10,530
what is the right source

1092
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,309
of truth.

1093
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,579
Document system,

1094
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,579
everything is kind of isolated.

1095
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:16,458
There is no

1096
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,079
uh consolidation in one

1097
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,360
single place that leads into time consuming.

1098
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,478
Time is wasted looking into

1099
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:27,539
these different applications. There are teams

1100
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,699
looking into one application, other teams

1101
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,820
looking through other applications, and at the end they're

1102
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,280
looking for the same information.

1103
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,128
That is also leading to

1104
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,349
longer time to take actions.

1105
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,728
And today, you know, even, even our capacity

1106
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:44,809
to stay focused has been reduced

1107
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:46,889
over the time. I think today we can

1108
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:48,958
stay like maybe 2-3 minutes focused on something,

1109
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,309
so we need to take action

1110
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,610
quickly, faster.

1111
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:55,668
And the last one, which is probably my, my,

1112
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:58,530
the one that I identify myself the most is the

1113
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,668
routine tasks.

1114
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:00,889
I hate it.

1115
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,300
Raise your hand. Anybody here who likes to, for

1116
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,458
example, Monday morning 9 a.m., you

1117
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,500
have to populate an Excel with numbers or

1118
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,269
something that is repetitive that is not

1119
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:11,280
really useful.

1120
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,938
Nobody's raising their hand obviously

1121
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,599
so we prefer to focus on something that is

1122
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,639
productive, something that is

1123
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:18,978
more shiny,

1124
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,000
exciting.

1125
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,639
I, I, I'm a soccer player and uh

1126
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,679
I will use that as an example. Uh, nobody would

1127
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,840
like to be on the bench.

1128
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:28,369
You want to be in the field. You want to be playing,

1129
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,699
so that is

1130
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,000
what what is happening with the traditional

1131
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
way of of working.

1132
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:36,260
And it translates into more than 40

1133
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,000
hours

1134
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,639
a month that we spend in

1135
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:42,059
wasting time repetitive

1136
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,659
tasks.

1137
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,510
That's why QuickSuite

1138
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:47,610
is

1139
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,329
changing the way

1140
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,809
that we understand the BI

1141
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,579
traditional tools.

1142
00:42:54,228 --> 00:42:56,708
It's a truly agentic AI

1143
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,449
that reimagines

1144
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,269
the way we work in the.

1145
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,000
IA era.

1146
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,679
QuickSuite is the enabler

1147
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,199
that combines data

1148
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,219
and intelligent actions.

1149
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,989
And I will walk you through this slide.

1150
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,070
If you see on the bottom, we still need data.

1151
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,329
AI is not going to work if we don't have data,

1152
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:19,849
if we don't have quality of data.

1153
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,188
You can see that we have enterprise data,

1154
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:25,739
we have actions, and within the enterprise

1155
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,739
data, we can have knowledge bases,

1156
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,978
basically any type of unstructured data.

1157
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,039
We can upload files also.

1158
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,289
Audio files,

1159
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,010
videos, PDFs,

1160
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,070
Word docs,

1161
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:38,969
any type of unstructured data.

1162
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,369
And we can also use the quick sight data, structured

1163
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,530
data. And we are adding this

1164
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,570
concept of spaces.

1165
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:48,329
Think about spaces like a storage.

1166
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:51,820
Where you cannot only store data

1167
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,918
in this case, where you can accept deliveries, let's

1168
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:54,619
say in that way.

1169
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:57,719
But through the actions you can also

1170
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,918
interact with third party apps

1171
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,599
so you can also send deliveries.

1172
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,389
So our storage is going to be able to

1173
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:05,929
store data but also send.

1174
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:09,699
Data or action into third party

1175
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,438
applications. And sometimes

1176
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,820
our enterprise data is not enough. We need

1177
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,039
to go out there,

1178
00:44:15,378 --> 00:44:17,539
go to the web, go to the LLMs,

1179
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:19,079
Bedrock, uh, models

1180
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,128
to enrich our

1181
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,079
enterprise data.

1182
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,929
Once we have that base, that,

1183
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:27,039
uh, foundation layer.

1184
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,168
Since we are working with data,

1185
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,809
Governance and security is a very critical

1186
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:35,168
aspect in our solutions.

1187
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:37,208
We are

1188
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:39,550
Using

1189
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:40,719
Greek side.

1190
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:43,398
Governance and data security

1191
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,239
because it's reliable. We have been using it for 8 years

1192
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,260
roll of security column level security,

1193
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,958
uh, role permissions

1194
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,378
and we are adding additional capabilities to

1195
00:44:52,378 --> 00:44:54,780
manage all the additional unstructured

1196
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,820
data, uploading files, actions,

1197
00:44:56,938 --> 00:44:57,579
and so on.

1198
00:44:58,099 --> 00:44:59,199
So once we have our

1199
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,780
governance and data, uh, layer we

1200
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,360
have our

1201
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:03,679
data foundation

1202
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:04,918
we have the

1203
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,458
capabilities. What are those capabilities?

1204
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,500
Chat agents, research,

1205
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,958
Quicksight flows and automate.

1206
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,389
We want to democratize the access

1207
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:16,648
to the insights.

1208
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:19,030
What is the best way to democratize

1209
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,309
the access to insights?

1210
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,699
Having an easy tool.

1211
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,780
A tool that anybody, no matter how

1212
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
tech savvy you are,

1213
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:28,849
you can use it,

1214
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:30,260
and the best way is a chat.

1215
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,159
Natural language

1216
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:34,599
type a prompt type what you want

1217
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:37,059
and ask for the question. Ask for the insight that

1218
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:37,840
you're looking for.

1219
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,639
That is the chat agent capabilities

1220
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,260
access to any type of insight,

1221
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,579
no matter what it is. I don't care anymore if it's

1222
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,780
a structured or unstructured data.

1223
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,019
I just want my insight.

1224
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,418
Quicksight, we are still using Quicksight.

1225
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,619
Quicksight is part of Quick Suite, so there are

1226
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,619
times where we will need to access or

1227
00:45:57,619 --> 00:45:59,889
see because we are very visual, uh,

1228
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,139
animals. That's true. We need to see a graph.

1229
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,179
We need to see a chart so you can still

1230
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,340
use Quicksight.

1231
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:08,128
And research.

1232
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,309
Think about the research for a more

1233
00:46:14,128 --> 00:46:14,949
or deep dive deep analysis.

1234
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,510
Think about a report like a benchmark

1235
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,750
benchmark analysis.

1236
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,639
More professional format like when you have a

1237
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:23,360
consultancy company coming to your

1238
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,000
uh company to do a benchmark analysis

1239
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,119
of one of your products or you want to go to market

1240
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,659
with a with a product or

1241
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,398
that is what research is gonna help you with

1242
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,599
and I will I will talk a little bit more about that later

1243
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,628
on. So

1244
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,829
this is helping with the insights

1245
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,610
with the data,

1246
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:41,918
but I mentioned before that one of the things that I

1247
00:46:41,918 --> 00:46:44,648
hate the most is repetitive task routine

1248
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,590
flows and automate those

1249
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,708
are focusing on tackle

1250
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,510
this problem

1251
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,550
flows is gonna help you to.

1252
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,280
Avoid this repetitive day to day task

1253
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:57,840
like when you have to

1254
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,409
look into the dashboard, find some outliers,

1255
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,579
for example, and do something with those

1256
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,699
outliers later on in another tool

1257
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:05,228
you can,

1258
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:07,679
you can automate that through uh the flows

1259
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,599
and in those cases where you need to

1260
00:47:09,978 --> 00:47:12,458
interact with multiple agents with multiple

1261
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,539
departments, automate is gonna

1262
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:16,699
be the solution and I will go through this

1263
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:18,219
in a little bit more later on.

1264
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,719
But since we are talking about BI

1265
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,840
or I guess most of us are coming from

1266
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,019
the BI world,

1267
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,619
let me walk you, walk you through

1268
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:27,659
the

1269
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,300
journey from self-serving BI

1270
00:47:30,438 --> 00:47:32,519
into uh AI

1271
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,539
assisted BI

1272
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,179
traditionally what we do.

1273
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:38,188
We ask the customer, OK, what are the

1274
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,329
questions that you want to

1275
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,719
ask to the data?

1276
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,679
And from there we find where is the data

1277
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,590
and we build the dashboard and there is a unidirectional

1278
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,849
communication from

1279
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:50,530
the users and the dashboard

1280
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:51,809
and this is uh

1281
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,349
something that we need to continue to be working on

1282
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,469
because the dashboard needs to be updated.

1283
00:47:56,989 --> 00:47:59,148
So what we are doing now, moving into

1284
00:47:59,148 --> 00:48:01,269
the next generation of BI with

1285
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:02,079
agentic AI.

1286
00:48:02,398 --> 00:48:04,559
Is combining the data creating

1287
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,639
this layer which here is in the middle

1288
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:08,360
and before it was the bottom layer

1289
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,978
where we are where we are combining

1290
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:14,000
structure unstructured near real

1291
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,619
time data

1292
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:17,320
and we need to uh keep in mind also

1293
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,760
that uh one of the uh probably

1294
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,199
strongest or most uh.

1295
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:24,438
Areas that I think is going to be changing

1296
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:26,519
in the future for the good is the MCP

1297
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:28,099
connection to third party data.

1298
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,019
So we have the

1299
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,059
single source of data, let's say that,

1300
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:34,699
and then we move into how to interact

1301
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:35,340
with that data.

1302
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,659
Chat flows research automate I mentioned

1303
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:40,639
those before, but

1304
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,659
let's go even beyond that.

1305
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,099
Add these capabilities into some of

1306
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:46,878
the applications that we use more commonly

1307
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:47,860
Outlook,

1308
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:50,260
Slack, uh, Word, even in your

1309
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,260
browser you can install or

1310
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,360
add an add on into your browser

1311
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:55,079
so you can,

1312
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:55,989
uh,

1313
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,699
add the chat and interact with your with your browser

1314
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,699
with the content of the whatever is the web,

1315
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:03,099
uh, that you are the browser that you're loading into a browser

1316
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,179
so. Then

1317
00:49:05,438 --> 00:49:07,489
going back into the dashboard quicks side,

1318
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,958
what we are doing is not only

1319
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,280
not allowing only the users to

1320
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,320
get inside but also directly

1321
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,679
from the dashboard being able to

1322
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:17,559
take actions.

1323
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:21,989
From the data itself in the dashboard,

1324
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:24,820
connect or send an action to a third party

1325
00:49:25,668 --> 00:49:28,239
application. So you need you don't need to to leave the dashboard.

1326
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:31,679
I was telling you before about the quick

1327
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:33,628
research and uh

1328
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,659
think about quick research

1329
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:38,438
you have as a company you have launched several

1330
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:40,458
services to the market several products to the market.

1331
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,530
And you want to launch a new one so you have a

1332
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,469
history of data

1333
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:45,369
about

1334
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:47,840
marketing campaigns, what you did,

1335
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,208
what was working well, what was working not that

1336
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,648
well, the outcome in the

1337
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:54,889
structure data showing you the sales

1338
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:56,829
increase sales go down, whatever

1339
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,869
so quick research is gonna use all that data

1340
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:03,250
plus data that is in the foundational models

1341
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,289
and if you want also data from the

1342
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:06,208
Internet, from the web.

1343
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:07,728
To create this

1344
00:50:08,978 --> 00:50:10,989
professional report with citations so you know

1345
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:13,030
where from each data

1346
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:15,050
is coming from so there is

1347
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,590
let's say no risk or lower

1348
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,590
risk to hallucination because you know where

1349
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,349
is the data coming from.

1350
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:25,820
Flows I mentioned before helping

1351
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,059
with your day to day task.

1352
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:28,949
I was talking with one customer,

1353
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,679
uh, in the telco industry.

1354
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:33,500
They were using a flow just to check

1355
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,039
through the

1356
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,119
call records from one month,

1357
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,559
find outliers,

1358
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:40,219
and, uh, the outliers detected

1359
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:42,039
compared with the previous

1360
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
2-3 months average consumption

1361
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,699
and in case that there was like a 50%.

1362
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:47,750
Uh,

1363
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,688
or the consumption was 50% over the average

1364
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:51,769
automatically

1365
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,898
trigger and create a thick in Jira.

1366
00:50:54,188 --> 00:50:56,309
So that's one example of one simple

1367
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:57,128
flow that you can,

1368
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,389
uh, create with quick flows.

1369
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,610
Quicker to make it's a little bit more

1370
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,610
complex because it requires a little

1371
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,750
more technical

1372
00:51:06,128 --> 00:51:06,750
knowledge

1373
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:08,188
and uh

1374
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:10,769
think about it as a

1375
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:11,309
more.

1376
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:13,909
Multi-agent

1377
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,659
cooperation where you can even

1378
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,320
even include some steps with

1379
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,199
a Python code to be executed.

1380
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:23,159
And one example would be

1381
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,289
uh human resources

1382
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,099
department where you want to uh

1383
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,739
Add new users into the system and you know

1384
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:33,000
you need to work with multiple, multiple,

1385
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,219
uh,

1386
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,889
areas of databases and so on to

1387
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:37,938
add that user.

1388
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:40,530
To summarize,

1389
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,099
What we are doing with Quicksight and now Quick Suite

1390
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,000
is providing insight for everybody,

1391
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:48,769
everyone. You don't

1392
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:50,739
need to be a tech savvy as I mentioned before

1393
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,909
because it's an easy tool to use

1394
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,219
basically you just need to type what you want to do

1395
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,829
even when we I was talking about flows

1396
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,148
you can build a flow

1397
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,469
literally telling I want a flow

1398
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,668
that is doing this, this and that

1399
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,289
just describing the different

1400
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,289
multiple steps.

1401
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:11,719
Unlock new business values as Moody's

1402
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:12,300
shared today

1403
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:13,219
with us

1404
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,119
how they are embedding Quicksight

1405
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,320
into their intelligent risk platform, helping

1406
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,030
their customers to do better decisions.

1407
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,208
And the last one

1408
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:25,139
Answers into action. I just mentioned

1409
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:27,159
about I just talked about this previously

1410
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:29,860
directly from the dashboard when you detect something

1411
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,938
when there is an insight that is critical

1412
00:52:31,938 --> 00:52:32,760
or is uh

1413
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,289
uh important to highlight,

1414
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,079
you can send that information into a third party.

1415
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,300
With that,

1416
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,668
if you have more

1417
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,039
interest in knowing a little bit more,

1418
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:45,570
you can scan this QR code. You

1419
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,809
can go to the QuickSite embedded Quick Suite,

1420
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:49,010
but I will

1421
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:51,219
highlight this, uh,

1422
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:53,530
one on my on the left of the

1423
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,929
slide, the Quicksight community.

1424
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:58,228
Because it contains

1425
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:00,219
all the information that you need,

1426
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,369
literally,

1427
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:04,300
there is a YouTube channel with, uh, videos.

1428
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,929
There is a section for Q&A.

1429
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:09,728
There are webinars that we

1430
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,878
run every week,

1431
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:13,489
workshops that we run monthly. Everything

1432
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:14,909
is here, even myself,

1433
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:17,929
and I have been working with Quicksight for 4.5

1434
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,929
years. I go to the Q&A sometimes

1435
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:20,869
when I have questions

1436
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,769
because we have a community of people also

1437
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:24,780
helping to answer,

1438
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:25,969
uh, questions.

1439
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:31,239
We're Thursday so probably there is only one

1440
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:33,438
more session before uh before

1441
00:53:33,438 --> 00:53:34,300
the end of the day

1442
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,000
and to end I would like to.

1443
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,228
Ask or share something with you. I have 6 more

1444
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,378
minutes. Do you know

1445
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:43,199
Bernard Boggles?

1446
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,300
Anybody knows here who is Bernard Bogos?

1447
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,659
Yeah, he's AWS CTO.

1448
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,800
Uh, uh, in fact, his

1449
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,219
keynote is gonna be in around one hour, so

1450
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:55,559
I highly recommend if you have time to join.

1451
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,918
If you go to his LinkedIn and you can go to

1452
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,599
to

1453
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:01,219
to LinkedIn right now on your phone if you have a if

1454
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:01,800
you want to.

1455
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:04,809
In his background on the LinkedIn,

1456
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,168
he has one quote that says

1457
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,648
the most dangerous

1458
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,610
sentence in English

1459
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:11,570
is

1460
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,228
we have always done things on this

1461
00:54:14,228 --> 00:54:16,378
way. I love

1462
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,418
it. I love it.

1463
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:21,860
Because If you're doing

1464
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,030
things in a way today and they work, it doesn't

1465
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,099
mean that you cannot do things better.

1466
00:54:27,148 --> 00:54:29,539
There are more things that you can explore.

1467
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:31,500
So I will

1468
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,579
end my session, encourage you.

1469
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,349
If you haven't

1470
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:36,648
tried yet Quick Sue,

1471
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:39,168
try. Even if you

1472
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:41,559
need to reach out to us, you need credits,

1473
00:54:41,648 --> 00:54:42,969
you need to reach out to us.

1474
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,079
And I'm sure you will

1475
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,010
like it. With

1476
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:50,250
that, uh, please

1477
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,250
complete the session survey, and

1478
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,610
I think we have some time for, for

1479
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,628
questions as well, so

1480
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,550
I will ask my colleagues to

1481
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,550
come back to the stage and.
