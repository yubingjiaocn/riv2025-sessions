1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
- Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to our session.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,390
I'm Ravi, Senior Solutions
Architect at AWS,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,940
and today I'm joined by
Brian-Lloyd Newberry,

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,610
Associate Vice President,
Enterprise Architecture,

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,210
and Tabare Gowon, Lead
Architect, Cox Automotive.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,490
Just a quick question before we dive in.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,020
How many of you are experimenting

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,853
with AI agents in your organization?

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,240
And keep those hands up
if you have launched one

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,103
to production and operating at scale.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,440
You see the drop?

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,330
That's what we're gonna talk about today,

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,340
and you'll see Cox Automotive's blueprint

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,840
for addressing this challenge.

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,510
So here's the agenda.

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,900
I'm going to do a quick intro
of Amazon Bedrock Agent Core,

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,460
then hand it over to BLN,

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,800
who will talk about Cox
Automotive's agentic AI journey

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,930
and their success blueprint.

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,370
Tabare, then we'll walk you through

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,860
a reference implementation,
key considerations,

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,930
and lesson learned from the trenches.

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,813
We'll stick around for
any Q&A, so let's dive in.

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,400
So the biggest challenge
we see getting your agents

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,410
from prototype to production.

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,210
What are AI agents anyway?

27
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,330
They're autonomous
systems that can reason,

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,420
make decisions, use tools to take actions

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,390
in order to perform goals autonomously.

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,780
Your POC works great, but
there are five key challenges

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,730
that you must address.

32
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,520
Runtime, you need scalable infrastructure

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,930
to run long-running workflows
with complex orchestration.

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,830
Without the performance
overhead and the cost overruns.

35
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,380
Agents need to maintain context

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,990
and to have a meaningful conversation

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,780
with the end customer across the sessions.

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,603
So you need to have a
server-managed memory offering.

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,080
Agents, you need to
secure access to agents,

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,870
the tools they access, and the data.

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,260
Agents need a mechanism to
discover your existing systems

42
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,390
through agent-ready tools

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,100
and talk to other agents seamlessly.

44
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,450
And because agents are
non-deterministic in nature,

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,360
you need complete visibility
into their execution

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,110
so that you can trace, debug,
and evaluate their behavior.

47
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,273
Let me use an example
to drive this better.

48
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,170
So picture a service technician assistant.

49
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,780
A customer walks in with
a check engine light.

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,360
The technician takes
pictures of the dashboard,

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,640
perhaps records the engine noise,

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,340
and keys in customer concern.

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,720
The agent uses this data,

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,440
looks at the knowledge
sources, like OEM manuals,

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,500
technical service bulletins,
recall notices, and so on,

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,560
in order to come up with
a proper diagnostic plan.

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,900
The technician starts working on it,

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,730
and the technician finds something else,

59
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,050
then the agent has to adapt

60
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,430
and make a different recommendation.

61
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,280
So you see this back
and forth that goes on

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,190
to adapt and diagnose the car.

63
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,427
The service technician assistant

64
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:49,590
determines that they need
parts to fix the car,

65
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,140
then the agent goes and
checks the internal system,

66
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,600
pricing, inventory, availability,

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,450
and keeps customer preferences in mind.

68
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,240
This customer prefers quality OEM parts,

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,193
or this customer is budget conscious.

70
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,710
And then recommend the parts.

71
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,450
And if parts are not in stock,

72
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,590
perhaps agent has to log into
legacy supplier applications,

73
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,173
web applications, and place order.

74
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,560
So this repair can take hours,

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,170
and the agent maintains
a session throughout.

76
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,360
And when the customer returns weeks later,

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,190
the agent must remember everything

78
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,400
to resume the diagnostic process again.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,670
So now imagine this whole
infrastructure scaling up,

80
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,950
supporting multiple technicians,

81
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,203
addressing multiple customer problems,

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,190
and with full session isolation.

83
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,010
And you need to trace every single step,

84
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,040
how an agent recommended a
particular diagnostic step,

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,140
and what sources it used.

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,630
For complete debugging and evaluation.

87
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,100
So without these capabilities,

88
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,350
we believe you are stuck
in the prototype mode.

89
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,513
And that's the gap AgentCore fills.

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,180
So AgentCore offers five
fully managed services

91
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,580
with two special purpose tools.

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,150
Runtime is secure,
scalable, and serverless.

93
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,490
It supports multi-modal inputs,

94
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,440
up to 100 megabytes of payload,

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,350
with long running sessions
up to eight hours.

96
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,950
You can use any framework
to build the agent,

97
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,650
and you can use it with any model.

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,200
Memory offers a short-term memory

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,720
for storing the conversational state,

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,553
and long-term memory to extract,

101
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,723
to learn from customer
interactions and adapt.

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,180
There are out-of-the-box strategies,

103
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,980
such as user preferences,
semantic facts, and summarization.

104
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,780
You can use those strategies,

105
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,973
override them, or bring your own strategy.

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,190
Identity provides secure authentication

107
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,480
and credential management.

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,860
It supports OAuth and IAM out-of-the-box.

109
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,690
And Gateway converts your existing APIs

110
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,410
and Lambda functions as
agent-ready MCP tools,

111
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,590
and provides a built-in
semantic search mechanism

112
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,973
for intelligent discovery.

113
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,320
Observability gives
you complete visibility

114
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,480
into agent's path trajectory,

115
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,440
with out-of-the-box CloudWatch dashboards,

116
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,340
and integrates with your
existing observability stacks

117
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,553
via open telemetry format.

118
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,880
Browser enables the agent

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,750
to perform complex web automation tasks,

120
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,820
and Code Interpreter allows agents

121
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,810
to run ad hoc complex calculations

122
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,110
in any language in a secure sandbox.

123
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,440
So we believe this is the infrastructure

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,390
that gets your agents into production.

125
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,100
With that, I'll hand it over to BLN

126
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,560
to walk through Cox Autos
Agentic AI Blueprint.

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,393
Thank you.

128
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,100
(audience applauds)

129
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,360
- You all hear me okay?

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,590
Good.

131
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,330
So my name is Brian-Lloyd Newberry,

132
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,800
and everybody calls me BLN.

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,510
If you wanna know why,
come up after the talk,

134
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,460
and I'm happy to tell you.

135
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,530
I have the privilege of leading

136
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,593
the Cox Automotive Product
and Technology Innovation Lab.

137
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,850
Me and a small team have,
for the last three years,

138
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,640
been completely embedded in generative AI,

139
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,403
and in this journey to move
toward agentic software.

140
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,670
I wanna start by just introducing
you to Cox Automotive,

141
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,530
'cause you may not understand the brand,

142
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,650
you may not understand Cox
Automotive as an entity,

143
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,170
but who here has shopped for a car

144
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,990
or bought a car anytime, right?

145
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,890
Not everybody, right?

146
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,520
But if you've heard of
brands like autotrader.com

147
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,620
and kellybluebook.com,

148
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,810
you're running into some of
the largest consumer portals

149
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,400
in the automotive industry.

150
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,850
People use them to buy vehicles

151
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,050
every single day, and so we
get a lot of traffic there.

152
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,140
We do websites for the
majority of the OEMs,

153
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,530
the automotive manufacturers,
in the United States,

154
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,920
so we see a lot of web traffic there.

155
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,970
So in the consumer space,

156
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,450
we see a ton of consumer
information coming together.

157
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,990
We also provide liquidity
in the automotive market.

158
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,970
If you've ever traded a car in,

159
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,180
you probably have had that car liquidated.

160
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,370
The dealer took it
through Mannheim Auctions,

161
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,920
sold it, and bought other
cars from Mannheim Auctions

162
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,120
to sell to other people.

163
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,310
We also offer an entire
suite of dealer software,

164
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,530
things like ERPs, custom CRMs,

165
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,020
inventory management, and the like,

166
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,330
as well as a suite of
finance applications,

167
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,170
and we're moving into mobility
and other spaces as well.

168
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,070
We're the dominant player
in the automotive industry

169
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,743
for software providers.

170
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,120
Because we have that much
visibility in the industry,

171
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,530
we have a view of everything happening.

172
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,840
We see the automotive
industry every single day.

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,720
Just as a round number, we get
about 5.1 trillion insights

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,153
about vehicles in the market.

175
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,880
We see hundreds of millions
of customer interactions

176
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,300
as people look at vehicles,
they get their vehicles.

177
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,483
They get serviced and move
through that life cycle.

178
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,010
And we provide all of, we
take all of that information,

179
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,350
which is the lifeblood of AI,

180
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,180
and we wrap AI models around it.

181
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,430
We've been doing AI for quite a while.

182
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,620
We have hundreds of AI
models in production.

183
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,513
I think 150-something was a
threshold we crossed last month.

184
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,093
Some of those might be agentic.

185
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,830
All right, so what I wanna do today

186
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,550
is tell you how, as an
organization, you can get moving.

187
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,800
One of the things we see as
we work with product teams

188
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,970
across the organization
and engineering teams

189
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,663
is there's a lot of
playing with agentic AI.

190
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,640
Although, most of the time,

191
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,880
people are just playing with
assistants, not agentic AI.

192
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
And so there's a lot of generative AI

193
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,150
and sort of like noodling
around the edges.

194
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,710
But people don't really know
what is an agentic application

195
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,210
and how do you get moving
and how do you build it.

196
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,330
Our chief product officer has this saying,

197
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,040
"Start with crazy and work backwards."

198
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,410
And so I'm gonna tell you
about a crazy experiment

199
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,810
we ran this past August.

200
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,270
And then Tabare's gonna show you

201
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,090
how one of the specific
projects that we kicked off went

202
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,473
and then we'll wrap it up.

203
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,960
As I said, we've been in
this journey a long time.

204
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,770
Mannheim, our auction provider,

205
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,200
has been around for probably
80 years at this point.

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,390
I should know that number
off the top of my head.

207
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,263
Sorry, Roger.

208
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,570
We've been, in 2018,
we went all in with AWS

209
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,320
and migrated from 50 data
centers down to three

210
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,090
and the rest running in AWS
regions, both east and west.

211
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,180
We've been doing predictive
AI for a very long time

212
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,340
using traditional machine learning models.

213
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,290
And Kelly Blue Book, that little book

214
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,970
that people used to literally buy

215
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,740
to look at the price of used vehicles

216
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,610
was a mathematical compilation
of vehicle valuations

217
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,713
that's going back 100 years.

218
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,183
In 2023, something happens.

219
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,610
So November 30th, 2022, Chat
GPT was released by OpenAI,

220
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,293
that the Chat GPT-3 model went live.

221
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,200
That created a ton of buzz.

222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,940
Again, we knew that these
models were out there.

223
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,170
We've been looking at them.

224
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,400
Created a ton of buzz.

225
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,170
And what happened is in March of 2023,

226
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,950
we went all in on generative AI.

227
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,410
We took this team that
I'm leading right now,

228
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,720
we threw us in, and within a month

229
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,280
had access to multiple providers,
models in our environment.

230
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,630
We built a sandbox.

231
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,830
We started to build products.

232
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,550
And in the following year, we
had three major products live,

233
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,510
one of which saved about $750,000 a year

234
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,460
by just eliminating the need to pay

235
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,170
for content to be
generated someplace else.

236
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,150
And our content was better and faster.

237
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,640
And then we went in with
products for dealers

238
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,360
that increased response
rates from customers by 50%.

239
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,763
And we did other products as well.

240
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,180
On top of, to power that
generative AI model,

241
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,550
we really focused on our data

242
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,930
and bringing all of our data together.

243
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,013
And in 2024, on the way
back from Amazon re:Invent,

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,240
we launched a new initiative.

245
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,470
We set up a couple of teams

246
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,780
to go in and dive into the agentic space

247
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,060
and get ahead of the industry.

248
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,270
There was a lot of FUD
and excitement there,

249
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,480
but there wasn't a lot of meat behind it.

250
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,620
And we did a ton of work.

251
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,170
We were really successful driving through

252
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,500
building internal apps,
doing proof of concepts.

253
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,463
But we were kind of stuck.

254
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,950
We didn't really get a lot of
pull through on our products.

255
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,970
We had some.

256
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,290
We had four or five products

257
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,710
using generative AI in production.

258
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,570
A couple of them internal,
the rest external.

259
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,670
But we weren't seeing the pull through

260
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,560
from our product teams.

261
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,930
People had things they needed to deliver.

262
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,830
They didn't wanna disrupt
what they were doing.

263
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,153
People were scared.

264
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,400
I bet you if you went,

265
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,950
if we all sat down and
asked what an agent is,

266
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,320
there would actually be some debate.

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,790
Agentic applications, people
think about as a chatbot

268
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,790
with an AI, a generative
AI interface strapped on.

269
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,450
And that's a very naive
version of agentic AI.

270
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,070
Google deep research being,

271
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,350
or deep research in all
of the deep research tools

272
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,110
being one of the first examples I saw

273
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,430
of the true power of this kind of system.

274
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,160
But going back to Newton's principles

275
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,383
from high school physics,

276
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,100
you've got inertia,
momentum, and reaction.

277
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,790
So what you need to do

278
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,223
is you need to figure
out how to get moving.

279
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,750
If you're not changing anything,
nothing is going to change.

280
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,070
You have to get moving.

281
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,000
No one is an expert at
building agentic AI systems.

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,943
Like, it's been around for a year, right?

283
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,070
And having a PhD in math doesn't help you

284
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,960
because it's a soft skill.

285
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,143
It's looking at systems,
doing systems modeling,

286
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,190
writing text that helps
guide these LLM systems

287
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,210
to do things.

288
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,420
Just pick something and
get your teams moving.

289
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,090
So let's talk a little
bit about the craziness.

290
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,330
So the second, end of
the second week of July,

291
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,790
MJ said, "I wanna launch
five products by Labor Day."

292
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,790
And there are gonna be
agentic AI products,

293
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,730
brand new product capabilities in market.

294
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,520
And we said, okay.

295
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,710
Now we'd been building things,
we knew we could do that,

296
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,710
but we had five weeks to do
it and the teams that we had

297
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,200
had never built agentic AI apps before.

298
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,570
Well, Tabare and team
had built a little bit,

299
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,180
but they were a little ahead
of the curve, but not very far.

300
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,763
So we were starting from ground zero.

301
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,503
What do you do?

302
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,020
Your chief product officer and EVP

303
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,247
of product and technology is saying,

304
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:29,610
"We're launching five
products by Labor Day."

305
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,240
You're starting from ground
zero with five teams.

306
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,620
You've got the blank page problem.

307
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,120
So you panic.

308
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,790
Kind of like when you have to
put together a deck in a hurry

309
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,873
just as an example.

310
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,230
You don't know where to go.

311
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,063
You don't know how to move.

312
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:44,896
You're stuck.

313
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,130
So here's what's necessary to accelerate.

314
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,090
Have a goal, set a
deadline, drive excitement.

315
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,120
We had a goal, five projects,
five teams in production.

316
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,380
We had a deadline, Labor Day,

317
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,980
which was about five and a
half weeks from that point.

318
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,650
And we had excitement because what we did

319
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,780
is we brought those five
teams together in a room.

320
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,220
We made a lot of noise around it.

321
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,480
It was a big event.

322
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,250
And we said that we're
doing this hard thing.

323
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,360
We're gonna launch five products

324
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,920
and here's what the products are.

325
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,603
They weren't fully flushed out,

326
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,810
but they had a good core around them.

327
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,250
And we're gonna use
agentic AI to deliver them

328
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,443
and to in the solutions that
we are bringing to market.

329
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,500
So you've got the excitement.

330
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,510
Now, what do you do next?

331
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,860
What are our assets?

332
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,510
What are our gaps?

333
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,560
Now let's get moving.

334
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,050
So what do we have?

335
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,310
We were all on AWS.

336
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,960
We're a close partner with them.

337
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,050
We understood what their
product roadmap was

338
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,170
and we had been deeply
engaged with Bedrock.

339
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,280
We were one of the first customers

340
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,510
running Bedrock models in production

341
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,570
and first with access to Clawed.

342
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,910
We had a small team of internal expertise,

343
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,250
a couple of teams that had
built these types of apps.

344
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,160
And we had some ideas,
whether they were good or not,

345
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,630
sort of we didn't know yet.

346
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,463
We needed to get a team together.

347
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,720
Get them into production.

348
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,260
And we had to launch five things.

349
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,310
That's our inventory.

350
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,190
So what do we need?

351
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,020
I'm an architect.

352
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,110
So that's a kind of blank
pages are scary to architects,

353
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,210
especially in new spaces.

354
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,633
So you start out with the
reference architecture placemat.

355
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,870
So this is, what are all of,

356
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,120
we sat down and most of the gray in this

357
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,500
is stuff that we already had solved for.

358
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,980
But there's a lot of white boxes here

359
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,350
that we had to figure out.

360
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,230
Things like cost management
and model monitoring

361
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,380
and orchestration agent
workflows and tools

362
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,060
and API management and orchestration

363
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,940
and how to connect it to our data

364
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,490
and how to see what's going on.

365
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,750
You know where the story is going

366
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,910
'cause Ravi talked to
you about the products

367
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,570
that AWS has put together in
Bedrock and in Agent Core.

368
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,350
But this is a really scary
problem for a lot of teams

369
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,310
'cause it's a blank slate.

370
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,360
They don't know what to do.

371
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,210
So what do we do?

372
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,660
We were on Amazon Bedrock, we
said we're gonna stay here.

373
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,500
We're gonna take a risk

374
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,060
and we're gonna dive into Agent Core.

375
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,260
Agent Core hadn't been released.

376
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,370
It wasn't released until after

377
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,800
we were done with these projects.

378
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,590
We never released stuff into the market.

379
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,570
And again, it wasn't
hyper-scaled at that point.

380
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,300
But we never put stuff on
first generation products,

381
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,800
technology products into market.

382
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,810
We did here because
we'd partnered with AWS,

383
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,940
we saw the roadmap, we
understood what was there.

384
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,520
And we knew how silly it would be

385
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,200
for us to build it ourselves.

386
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,033
And more silly for us
to build it ourselves.

387
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,550
And more silly for our
teams to have to figure out

388
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,050
how to build them themselves.

389
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,750
You heard some of what Ravi
was talking about earlier.

390
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,140
So the next decision we made is,

391
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,400
you get into this conversation

392
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,060
about which agentic framework to use.

393
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,340
And I make the joke,
it's really not a joke,

394
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,630
that there's like a new agentic framework

395
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,100
every two or three days.

396
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,560
And there has been for the last year plus,

397
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,750
just like there's new models every day.

398
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,803
Pick one and go.

399
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,640
What you're doing here,
we'll talk about in a second,

400
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,580
you have the ability to pivot and change.

401
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,080
Especially if you're using agentic AI

402
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,580
to help you do that work.

403
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,413
Pick things and go.

404
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:09,550
And strands is an AWS
backed open source product

405
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,640
that runs natively.

406
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,990
And at the point we
started was best option

407
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,070
to go in and run on agent core.

408
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,263
And it met all of the needs we had.

409
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,590
The other thing is
agent core, sorry, yeah,

410
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,760
agent core could run other frameworks.

411
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,020
And we could have given one framework

412
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,610
to each of the five teams,

413
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,790
but would that, maybe we
would have learned things,

414
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,770
but we really wanted to
get a market in five weeks.

415
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,860
So let's focus all of our
energy learning one thing

416
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,380
and getting really good at
it and enabling the teams.

417
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,453
So focus is an important part of this.

418
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,990
So we talked a little bit about strands

419
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,973
at the high level architecture level.

420
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,810
Building, we talk about, I think,

421
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,817
as Ravi was talking,
we're talking about agents

422
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,110
and how magical they are

423
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,250
and all the things you have to maintain.

424
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,150
But building an agent
yourself as a developer,

425
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,000
there's only a couple of core
things you do in the agent.

426
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,820
One, you write some text,
which is the prompt.

427
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,620
Two, you make some configuration,

428
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,543
which is usually also written in text.

429
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,260
And three, you attach it to a model

430
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,180
with some configuration parameters.

431
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,710
And then you attach it to some tools

432
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,750
that allow it to do things.

433
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,370
Conceptually, that's all you have to do.

434
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,710
With strands, all you
really have to think about

435
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,530
is what the text you write
is and the tools you use are

436
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,953
and how you take that very
abstract system and make it real.

437
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,383
You're literally just writing
Python as configuration.

438
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,980
In this case, super simple
case from the strands website,

439
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,360
you're bringing in an agent,

440
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,880
you're bringing in a calculator
tool that already exists.

441
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,140
I don't have time today to show you

442
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,820
the implementation of that tool.

443
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,250
But if you looked at it, you'd
see the Python documentation

444
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,530
describing what the tool
is and when to use it

445
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,760
and what the parameter values mean,

446
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,050
just like you should be
doing with any Python

447
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,810
or any source code you write.

448
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,190
It's well documented.

449
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,890
And the strands framework can bring it in

450
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,603
and wire it in automatically.

451
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,417
And then you say to that agent,

452
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,997
"Hey, what's the square root
of whatever that number is?"

453
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,350
This is how LLMs actually solve
math problems, by the way,

454
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,610
or how they should.

455
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,310
You should rely on a
deterministic process to do that.

456
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,830
It really is that simple.

457
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,150
And you can get started in strands

458
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,220
running on your desktop today

459
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,633
or running an AWS
infrastructure in minutes.

460
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,240
So the key message here is get started

461
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,230
and focus your teams in on the
features and functionalities,

462
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,570
not the frameworks and infrastructure.

463
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,250
The language doesn't matter.

464
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,030
Jenna, I can write it for you.

465
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,760
The frameworks don't matter.

466
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,630
There's a hundred of them

467
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,780
and they all do pretty
much the same thing.

468
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,330
Find one that's really
well-supported and run it.

469
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,970
And since you're all here
at the AWS conference,

470
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,580
start with AgentCore and strands.

471
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,880
You can use the other
frameworks as necessary.

472
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,080
So I'd like to invite Tabare up.

473
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,330
And Tabare was the lead architect

474
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,430
for one of the projects we launched,

475
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,960
probably the most successful project,

476
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,760
the most customers using it today.

477
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,400
He's gonna tell you about what he learned

478
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,810
and what the journey was for that.

479
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,850
And then we'll come
together and wrap up on,

480
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,243
maybe we'll tell you how the
rest of the projects went.

481
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,850
- All right, am I on?

482
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,780
Great.

483
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,230
Okay, thank you, BLN, and
good afternoon, everyone.

484
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,690
My name is Tabare Gowon, and as BLN said,

485
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm a lead architect at Cox Automotive.

486
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,850
And so just a moment ago,

487
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,300
BLN shared with you our agentic journey,

488
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,210
our company's overall agentic strategy,

489
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,930
and where we're planning to
go with these principles.

490
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,850
Now, I'd like to walk you through

491
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,130
what that's actually looked
like on a product team

492
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,040
at Cox Auto, and hopefully leave you

493
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,620
with some of the patterns
that can guide you

494
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,800
to building your own agentic solutions.

495
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,910
But of course, I'm gonna have
to tell you how we got here.

496
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,100
So let's start at the top.

497
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,420
As BLN said earlier,
it's around 2022, 2023,

498
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,460
and the LLMs are hitting the mainstream,

499
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,860
chat GPT, et cetera.

500
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,180
If you were like our team,

501
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,380
you were probably
thinking around this time,

502
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,560
this tech is actually pretty cool.

503
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,520
I mean, how can we use it?

504
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,450
How can we put it here?

505
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,310
How could we put it there, et cetera?

506
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,060
And so our team, at the end of 2023,

507
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,140
started our first Gen
AI POC, and, oh, great.

508
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,580
At the beginning of this year,

509
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,190
we actually launched that product

510
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,870
called Predictive Insights.

511
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,760
It's a human-in-a-loop
Gen AI message generator

512
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,480
for our company's CRM.

513
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,340
So with Predictive Insights,
as you click a button,

514
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,990
as our dealers click a button,

515
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,160
they can craft personalized
messages to their customers

516
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,310
using all of the data that
BLN mentioned earlier.

517
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,910
And since we launched
in earlier this year,

518
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,800
we've got a lot of good praise.

519
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,210
Our dealers are loving it

520
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,970
because they can move their customers

521
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,123
right alongside their journey
with just a simple click.

522
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,320
But here we have a problem.

523
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,460
Predictive Insights requires
you to actually click a button

524
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,080
and generate a message to the customer.

525
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,600
But the reality is, at the dealership,

526
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,120
more than half of their
leads come in after hours

527
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,390
where there isn't anyone
to click the button.

528
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,300
So we thought to ourselves, all right,

529
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,530
this is working out pretty well.

530
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,750
How can we take what we just built

531
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,300
and move fully autonomous?

532
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,000
And in doing that process,

533
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,450
we realized the actual question was,

534
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,200
how do we build automated AI solutions

535
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,910
that our users will trust?

536
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,710
Because it's one thing to say,

537
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,720
yes, we need to build a solution

538
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,900
that knows a dealer's
voice and knows their brand

539
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,240
and can meet their customer
at any time of the day.

540
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,670
But at the same time, we need to do that

541
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,970
while maintaining safety
and brand reputation

542
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,020
just for us and the dealer,
all without human oversight.

543
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,020
So that became the challenge,
and here's what we built.

544
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,440
So this here is our fully
automated virtual assistant

545
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,960
for customer conversations
at the dealership.

546
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,180
It's built on Amazon Agent Core

547
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,983
and the Strands Agent Framework.

548
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,820
If we start at the top,
we have an orchestrator.

549
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,960
When a customer sends in a new message,

550
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,460
the orchestrator understands that intent

551
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,460
and routes that message down
to one of several sub-agents,

552
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,380
sales, service, and so on.

553
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,070
Each sub-agent now
understands its own domain

554
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,500
and it can handle its
part of the conversation

555
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,333
independently.

556
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,380
So then, once all the
sub-agents are complete,

557
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,160
the orchestrator now grabs
all of that resulting data

558
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,310
and crafts a message back to the customer

559
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,807
and continues the conversation.

560
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:14,220
And this goes back and forth

561
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,270
for as long as the
conversation is necessary.

562
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,220
Of course, as you can see in this diagram,

563
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,200
there's more to this story.

564
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,070
And sure, we can give you
all of the technical details,

565
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,990
but the reality is, when you're starting

566
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,443
one of these projects,
where do you actually start?

567
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,990
You start with your foundation,

568
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,663
and that foundation is Agent Core.

569
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,530
So, when you're building
conversational assistance,

570
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,100
you know one thing you need is
to keep your data separated.

571
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,830
And as BLN said earlier,

572
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,560
many of you who had your hand up earlier,

573
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,800
you know that these AI
frameworks, they change every day.

574
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,850
So the tools that you
build your solutions today

575
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,730
might not be the tools
that you use tomorrow.

576
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,280
So you're gonna need to
build your infrastructure

577
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,000
on things that are both safe

578
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,030
and that could evolve as
your business evolves.

579
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,270
And this is where Agent Core comes in.

580
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,640
It keeps your data sessions separated,

581
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,940
and it allows you to swap frameworks

582
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,850
without re-architecting your entire stack.

583
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,740
When my team started our process,

584
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,940
the guidance that we
received from several sources

585
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,120
was to start on Agent Squad.

586
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,390
I think this is AWS Labs, don't quote.

587
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,760
But the reality is, by the
time we got into mid-project,

588
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,800
the new guidance was use trans-agents.

589
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,260
This is a more better solution.

590
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,670
Go down that route.

591
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,640
Now normally, in the old days,

592
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,100
this could have taken several
weeks to migrate the project,

593
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,770
but because we had started
with solid foundation,

594
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,420
it only took us two.

595
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,090
So when you're building your solutions,

596
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,530
also start with a foundation

597
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,330
that can evolve with your business,

598
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,960
and that will leave you the
room to think about the problems

599
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,420
that actually matter to
your domain, like safety.

600
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,600
How do you keep these
agentic solutions safe?

601
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,190
Anyone?

602
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,053
For us, we red-team them.

603
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,720
So you might be asking,

604
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,970
all right, what exactly is red-teaming?

605
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,580
Red-teaming now is when you actively try

606
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,400
to make the system go off the rails,

607
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,840
and you can do this in a number of ways.

608
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,360
For our assistant, for example,

609
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,620
you could try asking the assistant

610
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,653
a question in a foreign language.

611
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,900
Another option is maybe
you can feed the assistant

612
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,240
bytes and bytes of unreadable characters.

613
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,910
Or if you're trying to be clever,

614
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,620
you could try to sweet-talk the assistant

615
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,130
to maybe just, maybe
give it its system prompt

616
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,420
or tool definitions.

617
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,200
You're basically trying to find
your system's failure modes.

618
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,510
And now, as you hear this,
you're probably thinking,

619
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,463
okay, isn't this just testing?

620
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,340
No.

621
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,160
Because testing checks what works.

622
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,590
And red-teaming actually
tries to break it.

623
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,730
And you can't leave this
type of solution to the end.

624
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,990
For us, we red-teamed
before our alpha phase,

625
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,140
our beta phase, and we
continue to red-team

626
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,700
as we move to production.

627
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,230
We catalog every exploit,
and then we fix them,

628
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,940
and then we iterate to the next thing.

629
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,670
And we do this after every code deployment

630
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,410
and every prompt change.

631
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,860
Because realistically, your
stakeholders are gonna ask you,

632
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,900
how does this thing break?

633
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,630
And if you do this, you'll
have both the answers

634
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,500
and the examples of what could go wrong.

635
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,530
And then, of course, you're
gonna have to fix it.

636
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,320
How exactly do you fix these solutions?

637
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,583
You use your guardrails.

638
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,630
So, because we're at this conference,

639
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,540
you've probably heard
about bedrock guardrails.

640
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,760
I'm here to say that most of you know

641
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,010
that you need something to prevent AI

642
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,270
from going off the rails.

643
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,470
That's a given.

644
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,900
But when you're dealing
with customer service,

645
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,420
if you only focus on blocking,

646
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,910
you're gonna provide a
poor customer experience.

647
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,420
So, in our opinion, you have
to consider your guardrails

648
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,850
from at least two perspectives.

649
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,430
Something to completely block the system,

650
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,880
as well as something to just
gently nudge the conversation

651
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,350
into a different direction

652
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,350
that you actually want
to do something with.

653
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,460
We call these hard guardrails
and soft guardrails.

654
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,800
Now, with hard guardrails,

655
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,290
the system doesn't even
talk, really, to the LLM.

656
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,480
Usually, these guardrails
sit right on top.

657
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,427
And they're the things that
respond with things like,

658
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:41,853
"I can't help that," and
the conversation stops.

659
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,150
These are the things
that you can configure

660
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,280
with bedrock guardrails.

661
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,390
On the other hand, soft
guardrails do use the LLM,

662
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,640
but you configure them with your workflow

663
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
or your prompt design.

664
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,530
So, for example, let's say,
this is really specific for us,

665
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,030
but I think you'll understand.

666
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,520
Let's say you created a virtual assistant

667
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,230
for the automotive industry.

668
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,980
And in the process of a
customer having a conversation,

669
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,607
the customer says, "Yeah, you know,

670
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,997
"I really do like this car,
but I have pretty bad credit.

671
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,947
"So I was hoping I could get into this

672
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,790
"for maybe 100, 150 a month."

673
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,580
And you've designed your virtual assistant

674
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,480
to solve a lot of problems,

675
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,220
but you don't want it to
handle pricing negotiation.

676
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,210
When you use soft guardrails,
you tune the system

677
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,467
so that it responds with,

678
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:31,687
"That's a great question
for our finance team.

679
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:33,810
"Let me schedule an appointment."

680
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,870
And these kind of guardrails allow you

681
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,620
to continue to be helpful
while staying safe.

682
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,510
So think about your guardrails

683
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,453
from both of these perspectives.

684
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,650
All right, so I've
given you a lot already.

685
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,720
But let's just pause for a second.

686
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,610
Let's say that many of you here

687
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,150
are trying to hit that
orange, ready to launch.

688
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,767
And after this conversation,
you've decided,

689
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:02,107
"All right, let's use Agent Core.

690
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:03,660
"That'll be our foundation."

691
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,200
And what this guy just
said sounded about right.

692
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,620
I'm gonna go home and
red team my application.

693
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,500
And because we are safe practitioners

694
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,000
of this agentic landscape,

695
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,660
I will also configure my guardrails

696
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,000
so that things don't go off the rails,

697
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,810
and I'll use the soft guardrails.

698
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,570
This point, you should
probably be ready to launch.

699
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,403
Correct?

700
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,960
No, because the reality is,

701
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,230
even if you red team your
system to see if it breaks,

702
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,200
you still actually have to
test that it works, right?

703
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,000
But traditional testing
can only take you so far

704
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,600
because these LLMs are probabilistic.

705
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,370
So you're going to need to find something

706
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,650
that's more dynamic.

707
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,810
All right, we know this.

708
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,550
So what are our options?

709
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,820
Well, we could just manually
review every conversation.

710
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,260
And that will work for a
couple dozen conversations,

711
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,910
maybe a couple hundred conversations.

712
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,160
But when you're dealing
with tens of thousands

713
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,700
of transactions daily, manual
review just won't scale.

714
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,030
So you're gonna have to
look for some other option.

715
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,423
And this is where automated
evaluation comes in.

716
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,840
So what do I mean by
automate your evaluation?

717
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,760
Just as you can use an LLM
to generate these responses,

718
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,060
you can use another LLM to judge

719
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,950
whether or not these
responses are correct.

720
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,010
This approach is called LLM as a judge.

721
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,830
And the process is pretty straightforward.

722
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,640
First, you generate a bunch
of test conversations.

723
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,440
Then you run them through your system.

724
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,273
(coughs)

725
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:48,990
Then you evaluate, how did it do?

726
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,450
And you track this over time.

727
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,250
Once you have actual data,

728
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,980
you can use the same evaluation framework

729
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,040
to test whether your system is working

730
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,390
for the things that matter.

731
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,430
So this type of testing
actually checks what's right.

732
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,180
For us, we track metrics like relevancy,

733
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,660
completeness, and tone,

734
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,950
things that matter for
customer conversations.

735
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,350
But of course, yours will be different.

736
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,683
So find the metrics that
matter most for your business.

737
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,130
All right, so we're gonna go back

738
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,980
to that previous slide one more time.

739
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,940
We're still here.

740
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,760
We know that agent core
is where we're gonna go.

741
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
Red teaming is the
right thing to do, sure.

742
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,430
Better our guardrails and the
soft guardrails, we got it.

743
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,040
And now you know that
not only are you trying

744
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,530
to test what breaks, but you
gotta make sure that it works.

745
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,100
So we're gonna automate our evaluation

746
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,470
so we can scale up for our
actual production needs.

747
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,193
At this point, now you're
ready to launch, right?

748
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,850
I think you already know
where this is going.

749
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,840
No, because like I said just a moment ago,

750
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,230
LLMs are probabilistic, and
you can do all of this work,

751
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,260
and you still will have
the LLM do something

752
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,950
that you least expected.

753
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,260
And the last thing you want is to wake up

754
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,270
to a whopping LLM bill.

755
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,713
So now what do you do?

756
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,960
Well, you need to put
something to stop the system

757
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,290
before it goes off the rails
while you're not around,

758
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,073
and that's where circuit
breakers come in to the mix.

759
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,720
So when I talk about circuit breakers,

760
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,333
I'm talking about the hard limits

761
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:34,100
that stop the assistant
when things go wrong.

762
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:39,100
In our case, we consider two
metrics as our hard limits,

763
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,530
cost limits and turn limits.

764
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,220
So for example, let's
say that in the process

765
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,160
of a conversation, we've identified

766
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,280
that the conversation
has hit our P95 threshold

767
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,820
in terms of cost.

768
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,610
At that point, the assistant will stop.

769
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,520
Likewise, let's say that
we're having a conversation

770
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,720
and we've gone back and
forth and back and forth

771
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,890
and back and forth and back and forth,

772
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,230
and all of a sudden, I
don't know why there's a two

773
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,790
and a zero underneath, but let's say

774
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,220
that we've hit 20 turns.

775
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,220
At the same time, our assistant will stop.

776
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,180
In either case, the P99 cost or the turn,

777
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,360
we hand off the conversation
to someone at the dealership

778
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,993
so now they can decide, does
this conversation continue?

779
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,010
So these type of metrics, cost and turn,

780
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,530
those are things that
Bedrock tracks for you,

781
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,560
but it's your job to analyze that data

782
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,900
and set the thresholds
that make the most sense

783
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,920
for your business.

784
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,560
So set these limits from day one

785
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,920
and know where your boundaries are

786
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,600
so that when you fail,
you can fail gracefully

787
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,200
and you can sleep well at night.

788
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,360
All right, so those are
some of the patterns

789
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,510
that we have learned through the process

790
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,510
of getting our project
into beta and beyond,

791
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,313
and let me share with
you where we are today.

792
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,980
So as I just said, we
are right now in beta

793
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,550
and our dealers are seeing
the results that they need.

794
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,170
We're hearing that their customers

795
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,480
are getting the answers that they need

796
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,350
both during the day and after hours.

797
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:24,350
We plan to launch at the
beginning of Q1, so stay tuned.

798
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,230
And that's really all I have right now.

799
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,420
Your system, however,
is gonna look different

800
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,780
because your requirements
are understandably different.

801
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,000
But if you start with
the right foundation,

802
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,150
like Agent Core, and focus
on the patterns that matter,

803
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:47,150
you also can create your automated
AI that your users trust.

804
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,683
Thank you.

805
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,920
- So I promised you we'd come
up and tell you how we did,

806
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,790
but before you do that,
who thinks, you saw one,

807
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,490
who thinks that's the only success we had?

808
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,220
Oh, come on, someone's
gonna be negative, right?

809
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,570
Who thinks we knocked
all five out of the park?

810
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,733
So thank you, I appreciate your faith.

811
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,910
Let's talk a little bit about it.

812
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,130
So we had five projects.

813
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,660
Today we have three apps in
production in a beta format.

814
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,600
The first one to be going full live

815
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,960
is the one that Tabare's
talking to you about.

816
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,330
We have an app going into production

817
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,920
that's actually being used in dealerships

818
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,920
that essentially, when
you price inventory,

819
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,510
there's a lot of work you have to do.

820
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,330
And we remind people to do
it and they don't do it.

821
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,200
And so we built an agentic
solution to do it for them.

822
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,820
And instead of nagging
them to do the work,

823
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,750
we said, hey, I did the work
for you, are you good with it?

824
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,450
And then we'll move that into
full agentic moving forward.

825
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,880
So that's another type
of product we built.

826
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,650
We built a couple others.

827
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,690
So three are in production today.

828
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,330
One's about to launch a little bit later.

829
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,520
And let's just say one we
took back to the drawing board

830
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,290
and reimagined.

831
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,140
That actually is probably
some of the most valuable

832
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,070
data we got is what didn't work, right?

833
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,070
What I'll tell you is
agentic systems are hard.

834
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,930
The hardest thing that we ran into is in,

835
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,300
this is a soft way of programming.

836
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,590
It's not deterministic.

837
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,840
This whole thing is non-deterministic.

838
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,020
And so the way you think about products

839
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,450
and the way you think
about capabilities here,

840
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,960
agents have agency, they
can do what they want.

841
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
You have to put the guardrails around,

842
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,010
but that's a hard thing for
people to wrap their mind around

843
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,110
from a product point of view.

844
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,130
So what were our lessons?

845
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,530
Let's talk really quickly
about our lessons today.

846
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,620
So the first lesson is get moving.

847
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,910
Nobody's an expert.

848
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,190
There's some great, Amazon
has some great offerings

849
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,170
here in Bedrock and Agent Core.

850
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,060
Strands is an option,
but there are a bunch of,

851
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,460
like as you heard, any agentic
framework can run on it

852
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,533
if you prefer something different.

853
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,403
The other is to think disruptively.

854
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,610
Many people would not have said,

855
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,500
we're taking five
projects and putting them

856
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,500
with live production traffic
with customers in five weeks.

857
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,240
That seems insane, right?

858
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,040
Start with crazy and work backwards.

859
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,270
Agenic AI lets you fundamentally
change your assumptions.

860
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,420
You can use it to build systems faster

861
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,370
than you can ever imagine before,

862
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,020
and you can have it build things

863
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,470
that you could never imagine.

864
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,040
And so the embrace of agentic is key,

865
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,900
and you need to be
using agentic every day,

866
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,300
not just as engineers,
but as product leaders,

867
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,930
as engineering leaders, as architects,

868
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,470
because until you get past
the fundamental understanding

869
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,780
that agentic is different,

870
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,560
you can't understand how
to build agentic products.

871
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,260
I talked a little bit
earlier about chatbots.

872
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,750
Tabare's application is
far more than a chatbot.

873
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,760
You have those multiple agentic layers.

874
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,920
There's a chatbot agent with other agents

875
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,900
back in the background doing work.

876
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,810
You can build tools like deep research.

877
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,840
You can build tools that essentially

878
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,890
invert the shopping funnel
so that you give customers,

879
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,010
just click on this button
and you can buy it.

880
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,390
There's all kinds of things you can do

881
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,890
that are not just chatbots.

882
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,480
Think beyond chatbots.

883
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,950
But you've gotta use it every day

884
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,893
'cause it's gonna change the way you work.

885
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
So, Tabare.

886
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,047
- Yeah, so when you're
thinking about those things

887
00:40:43,047 --> 00:40:44,553
and you start building,

888
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,820
what can you start with right after this?

889
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,820
Number one, start red teaming today.

890
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,290
I know it says tomorrow, but start today.

891
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,660
Learn how your system breaks.

892
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,740
Learn how to break your system

893
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,400
and do these things before
your customers get to it first

894
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,460
so that you can set up your guardrails

895
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,460
and prevent some of those
things happening down the line.

896
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,620
Second, design for your worst case.

897
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,680
If you already have an idea

898
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,810
of what kind of keeps you up at night

899
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,730
with what your agentic solution could be,

900
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,040
build your evaluation
framework around that

901
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,840
so that over time you can see

902
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,600
whether or not that was
truly the worst case

903
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,200
and whether or not you've mitigated

904
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,440
the crisis from occurring.

905
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,753
And then finally, as I said before,

906
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,110
even if you do all these other things,

907
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,430
things will still go wrong.

908
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,430
Just to let you know, things
will probably still go wrong.

909
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,900
So set your hard limits.

910
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,080
Understand what your thresholds are.

911
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,580
Understand what your boundaries are

912
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,970
so that when you do have these failures,

913
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,900
you can fail gracefully.

914
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,313
And if you do those things,
you'll be all right.

915
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,450
- So to wrap this up,
we're at AWS re:Invent.

916
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,300
And so I was thinking about like

917
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,350
what's the right message to land this on?

918
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,403
Today's your day one.

919
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,350
This is a Bezos quote.

920
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,540
Day one is a core Amazon philosophy.

921
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,650
We work very closely with them.

922
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,550
We talk about day one and
we adopt it in our practices

923
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,933
and try to model it.

924
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,133
Day two is stasis followed by irrelevance,

925
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,690
followed by excruciating painful
decline, followed by death.

926
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,400
And that's why it's always day one.

927
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,050
Get moving.

928
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,100
Don't be stuck in waiting
for someone else to do this

929
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,720
or the right answer.

930
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,533
Get moving and build something
in five weeks or one.

931
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,480
So I want you, there's a
couple of resources here.

932
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,633
There's a QR code for leveling up skills.

933
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,510
And there's a QR code

934
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,600
for the Asian Core Deep
Dive hands-on workshops.

935
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,770
I highly recommend that.

936
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,170
It's a great way to get your hands on

937
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,950
and see how easy it is
to build these things.

938
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,743
And so definitely scan
those with QR codes.

939
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,680
And please, please, please
complete the session survey

940
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,270
in the mobile app.

941
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,930
We'd love to hear your feedback
and how we could do better.

942
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,780
And thank you very much.

943
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,270
If you have questions, we'll
be up here for a little while.

944
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,140
We've got a few more minutes

945
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,420
before we need to relinquish the room.

946
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,450
So thank you very much for
being in attendance today.

947
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,617
(audience applauding)
