1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,169
Mic is hot. Beautiful. Well, thank you all for

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,198
coming. I know we're right here at the, uh,

3
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:06,328
towards the end of the day. Expo Hall is

4
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:07,070
closed.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,970
Well, it'll be closed in 30 minutes, so I

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,989
appreciate you all spinning the end of this with me.

7
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,608
Um, my name is Alex Dragg.

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,208
I work on the, the product and go to market

9
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,850
strategy side here at Kong,

10
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,489
and you'll notice a second name up on the screen, Michael

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,870
Field. You'll not see a second speaker.

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,219
It's because Michael Field is actually an agent.

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,629
He's going to help me give this presentation.

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,769
Just kidding.

15
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,548
He's just a co-worker who slacked off

16
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:33,090
and, and wasn't able to make it.

17
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,509
Um, I was hoping I'd get a laugh, cause, you

18
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:36,939
know, when the, when the crowd laughs,

19
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,548
I feel so much more comfortable here on stage. I

20
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:41,700
was able to just, just give me a fake one on 3,

21
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,130
it just makes me feel so much better.

22
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,478
Well, you're so that was OK. I wasn't even on 3. That

23
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,348
was excellent. Awesome. Thank you all.

24
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,469
So anyways,

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,098
um, agents,

26
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,609
agents, agents, agents, I'm sure that you

27
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,679
all have heard a lot about them at this event

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,298
this year.

29
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,380
Today I'm gonna be talking about.

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,848
Building state of the art gente

31
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:02,750
infrastructure.

32
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,659
Right? Cause this is where we find ourselves. Look,

33
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,010
we're not just talking about agents because it's,

34
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:09,879
you know, yes, there's a lot of hype,

35
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,219
there's a lot of agent washing, there's no doubt

36
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:12,900
about that.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,129
But there is a lot of promise here, right? There's

38
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,168
a reason we are accelerating

39
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,168
into this era of AI

40
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,448
agents, right? We've gone across lots of eras,

41
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:24,388
cloud, developer platform, mobile, whatever,

42
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,930
and now we are finding ourselves hurtling

43
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,469
towards the era of AI agents,

44
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,430
and not for fun.

45
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,338
For these reasons,

46
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:36,549
Yes, we can have lots of technical

47
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,198
conversations

48
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,138
about the AI agent.

49
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,879
But

50
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,859
they do real things for the business.

51
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,338
They make internal business processes, business

52
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,500
operations a whole lot more efficient, or at least

53
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,040
they can.

54
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:51,338
They actually, you know, sneak peek to a few slides from now.

55
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,489
They actually aren't really doing that right now for most folks,

56
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,120
but they can, and the promise is there.

57
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,838
We do believe they'll be able to reduce costs for the business,

58
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:01,198
boost productivity of every single individual

59
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:03,329
who leverages an agent or teams

60
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,959
of people who are leveraging an agent.

61
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,819
We think there are actual

62
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:09,399
agent products that will be able to be

63
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,659
built and generate

64
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,159
top line revenue or more top line revenue

65
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,599
and of course increase customer attention, right? There's look, the,

66
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,860
the promise is depending on how deep you wanna go

67
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,319
looking at the business, looking at business value, looking

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,360
at the tech, looking at technical value and

69
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,199
process and operations, there's the, the,

70
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,719
the potential really is.

71
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,949
Really, quite honestly unknown,

72
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,319
right? We just, we just don't know how good

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,800
this could get.

74
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,679
However,

75
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,278
it's not where we find ourselves.

76
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,580
We think about the promises of these things.

77
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:41,439
There's 4 numbers up here on the screen, you can

78
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,149
read them all.

79
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,599
But there's one

80
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,830
that I really want to focus on.

81
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,219
It's that 6% number.

82
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,860
When we think about automation, we think about more effective

83
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,758
process, we think about shipping new,

84
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,508
uh, net new generating products

85
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,258
that will drive net new revenue.

86
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,258
Look, it all comes back

87
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,740
to margins for the business.

88
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,520
Alright, everyone in here who's ever had to make a case

89
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,719
to buy buy technology, build something, look,

90
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:08,659
it comes down to a business case at the end of the day,

91
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,038
and at the end we're looking at margins for the business,

92
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,199
right? Agents

93
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,830
and AI programs

94
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:16,819
today are decimating these.

95
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,740
So you're 80, it's 84% of companies see

96
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,838
at least a 6% erosion

97
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,879
of net business margins, not AI program

98
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,099
margins, not this one project, not this one

99
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,490
product, gross business margins,

100
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,849
and that's just 84%, and that's just 6%,

101
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,838
which is a lot.

102
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,569
A quarter of companies, and this, I'm not making this up by the

103
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,860
way, there's a real report that, that, uh, that showcases

104
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,860
this. We have a blog about it if you wanna go read it on

105
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,939
the website, but a quarter of them see

106
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,058
greater than 16%.

107
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:45,080
I mean we're talking about something that's decimating the

108
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,250
fundamentals of business success

109
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:49,649
and now when I talk about this quite often.

110
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,758
People say, well Alex,

111
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:54,000
um, look, we're, that's fine,

112
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,258
like we're investing, we're willing to lose some money upfront,

113
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,159
but the reality is like that, that's not why this is happening.

114
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,520
Right, that's not why this is happening.

115
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,129
It'd be one thing if the number one challenge

116
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,210
for cost was, well, we're just, you know, we're

117
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,240
investing a lot of tooling, we're investing a lot of people,

118
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,750
investing in a lot of training, but that's actually not the case.

119
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,040
Right, the case there is it's actually fragmented visibility

120
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,389
across models, model providers, the infrastructure

121
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,600
providers, cloud environments, local

122
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,879
environments, hybrid environments. Nobody knows who's

123
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,319
using what, building what, consuming what, exposing

124
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,699
what, to whom.

125
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,040
It's only gonna get worse as agents proliferate

126
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,259
and sprawl and you know there was a lot of numbers on

127
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,619
or were a lot of numbers on the previous slide around

128
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,899
security we'll talk about that today too for sure and

129
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,119
lo and behold it's also a fragmentation problem.

130
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,689
The vast majority of organizations because look, there's a lot

131
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,059
of talk about it at this event.

132
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,689
AI governance,

133
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,309
majority of organizations, they simply don't have it.

134
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,670
And even if they do,

135
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,269
it oftentimes is just a bunch of memos,

136
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,000
right? It's a bunch of policies

137
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,420
that we say we're gonna follow, we say we're gonna

138
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,100
implement,

139
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,480
it's just

140
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,309
on a document somewhere,

141
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,579
right, not actually implemented, enforced

142
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,420
in the real world at one time, etc. etc.

143
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,439
and what is the result of that? Well,

144
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,858
there's a reason why 20% of all incidents now

145
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,939
are categorized as shadow AI incidents.

146
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,000
8 86% of organizations

147
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,220
are completely blind to how data flows

148
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,759
around,

149
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:20,579
right? Data moves around, these AI data flows.

150
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,278
And look, I'm not saying that anyone's doing anything

151
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:24,420
necessarily wrong.

152
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,939
It's hard.

153
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:27,858
There's a lot we have to do.

154
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,480
It's more than just two things, right? It's gonna get a lot

155
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,100
more complex in a second, I promise.

156
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:34,720
But it is this, just this part is hard, just knowing the

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,899
right model for the job is hard,

158
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,528
right? OK, now

159
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:41,928
we bring the right model or models. What

160
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:44,088
about security? What about guard rails? What

161
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:46,129
about res uh uh quality and

162
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,290
accuracy?

163
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,600
What about scrubbing sensitive data,

164
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,149
PII once again, especially as we

165
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:55,149
continue to expand the amount of models

166
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,350
that we're using, amount of clients and consumers

167
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,470
who need to leverage these things, amount of data

168
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,069
that we're training these models on.

169
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,588
OK, now we gotta be able to measure stuff, remember

170
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:04,290
cost.

171
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,858
Well, can we see how many tokens are being consumed

172
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:07,519
everywhere

173
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,149
and not just on the corporate cards, but all

174
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,149
those engineers that go and start consuming on

175
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:14,298
their individual personal cars, then expense it

176
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:16,369
later, right? Can we see all this?

177
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,838
Can we implement things like controls on consumption,

178
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,319
usage of tokens, right, can we rate limit these

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,519
things? What about

180
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,829
not just token rate limiting, but something

181
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,119
like semantic cash and caching responses to make

182
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,139
the actual cost of every transaction on

183
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,139
average go down.

184
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,178
Look, I can keep talking about

185
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,100
all the things that we need to do.

186
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,660
Right, there's a lot, it's very hard.

187
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,829
And organizations right now have so many things

188
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,889
that the market, that vendors, guilty

189
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,619
as charged,

190
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:47,759
are throwing at them, they're having to think about,

191
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,329
right? And that's just the LLM.

192
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,108
The reality is a lot more than that.

193
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,209
When we think

194
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,910
About the agent

195
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,059
We have to think about what

196
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:00,358
we refer to here at Kong

197
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,189
as the entire agentic data path.

198
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,338
Normally I have a nice little build for the slide, but I just couldn't

199
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,500
get the animation to work. But normally what I would show

200
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,738
is that, yes, you know, people are thinking a lot about this

201
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:11,259
agent.

202
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,298
So I start with just the agent, right?

203
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,920
So OK, what does the agent need? The agent needs a brain,

204
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,559
needs some reasoning faculty.

205
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,350
LLMs, excellent.

206
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,088
Yeah, let's go slap something in front of the LLMs.

207
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,369
You hear about LLM gateways, AI gateways, there's a

208
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:27,528
reason those are, those are popular, right? They

209
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:29,608
can implement some of those controls I just mentioned on the

210
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,608
previous slide, rate, limiting, caching, etc.

211
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,269
OK, the LLM is only trained on so much data.

212
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,108
What is it, if, if, what does the brain need to

213
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,040
make decisions?

214
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,879
It needs context.

215
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,230
It needs extra information from time

216
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,829
to time.

217
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:46,600
So, here comes MCP to the rescue.

218
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,730
No, actually not, right? MCP is

219
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,149
really good at enabling context. They can fetch

220
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:54,009
context, mutate context, that's fine.

221
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Where does the context come from?

222
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,980
What provides the context? Well,

223
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,738
we're talking about static data, static

224
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,889
information, this is gonna be an API call most of the time, at least, we

225
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,819
think this is going to be the best pattern so far.

226
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,000
But it's not just static data.

227
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:11,079
Agents will need to make decisions in real time

228
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,480
with the most up to-date information that they can.

229
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,100
So now we're talking about real-time data, now we're thinking about

230
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,139
event streams, event data,

231
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,519
getting a little bit closer to the direct

232
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,759
data. So it's not

233
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,879
just L LLMs.

234
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,639
The speed issues, the cost issues, the risk

235
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,199
issues.

236
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,639
So all those little squares in the slide before this,

237
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:31,000
there's a lot to think about for the LLM.

238
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,399
There's a whole lot more to think about across this data

239
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,629
path. How are we going to actually make these things worse,

240
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:36,340
work?

241
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
This gets even more complicated when we're

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,038
thinking about all the other agents. We

243
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,109
start thinking about multi-agent architectures, agent

244
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:43,739
to agent

245
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:46,158
or agent to agent to agent to agent, right, each

246
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,200
with their own data path to govern, to make cost

247
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,239
efficient, to make secure, make resilient,

248
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,308
right? And to prove my point,

249
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:54,369
let's just talk about that cost thing again.

250
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,340
If you look at the unexpected AI costs, which

251
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,479
are what are driving these these cost issues so far,

252
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,460
hopefully you can see it's probably a little small for those of you at least in

253
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,509
the back. LLM token

254
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,580
and API costs, that is the, if I

255
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,168
count correctly, the 5th

256
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,509
challenge,

257
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,259
right, for these AI programs.

258
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,330
The 5th,

259
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,849
uh, the 5th,

260
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,190
uh, greatest unexpected AI cost.

261
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,599
So once again, it's a lot more than

262
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,109
just what's going on

263
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,210
with the LLM.

264
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,869
All of the context and connectivity matters. Once

265
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,950
again, LLMs are our brain, they need context,

266
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:26,750
MCP.

267
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,259
Mutate, fetch,

268
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,700
enable at the end of the day, enable context for more

269
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,779
APIs and events.

270
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,408
Remember what is the challenge, what

271
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,038
is the thing that's driving these problems,

272
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,899
Fragmented visibility.

273
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,658
Not only in consumption of resources.

274
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:44,408
Visibility into how data moves across

275
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:46,428
this data path, and it's because we've ended up

276
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,428
here. Right, this is the,

277
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,788
I, this is not me saying everyone, anyone's done

278
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:53,330
anything, you know, horribly wrong, we've all been experimenting.

279
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,950
We've all been experimenting. And that's good. We have

280
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,619
to experiment. It's really, really good.

281
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:58,570
But,

282
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,440
look, The

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,469
the the problem is fragmentation. We

284
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,690
must unify

285
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,029
these ecosystems.

286
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,979
Right, we've been thinking in, in sort of pockets

287
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,979
right in the API land, which is where Kon has spent most

288
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,340
of our time, right, API management, API gateways.

289
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,129
We've been trying to, you know, talk about this unification

290
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,320
of the API ecosystem, right, but often they look, they

291
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,769
just, the migration can be painful. It seems scary,

292
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,840
right? But now we have a real reason to do that.

293
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,750
Now we have a real reason to think,

294
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,389
at least not a real reason, but more compelling, more,

295
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,808
uh, immediate reason given all these AI use cases

296
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,808
and AI initiatives to unify everything from the

297
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,849
API to the event to the LLM to MCP to

298
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:37,190
agent to agent, right? We must unify

299
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,029
then this this connectivity.

300
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,830
But it is not

301
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:43,250
just about implementing the proper technology or

302
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,330
getting rid of other stuff, that's not my point, I'm

303
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,029
not here to pitch at all.

304
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,519
You won't hear me talk about a Kong solution on

305
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,529
the stage. We can talk after if you want, but not up

306
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,639
here. But

307
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,798
remember, fragmentation is the killer,

308
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,080
so how do we go about solving this?

309
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,158
We think it starts by asking the right questions.

310
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:03,408
Now, I

311
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,000
speak to folks all over the place in the org,

312
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:08,428
CTOs, you know, Chief Data Officer, the,

313
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,830
the VPs of engineering, to the technical,

314
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:12,928
the platform teams, the data teams, the

315
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:13,769
individual app devs,

316
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,769
and what I oftentimes hear.

317
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,428
So we're asking this question a lot.

318
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,529
Right, what applications are we gonna build? What agents

319
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,389
are we gonna use, what frameworks are we gonna use,

320
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,048
right? What are these agents actually going to do? And that's a, that's

321
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,729
a good question. I'm not saying don't ask that question.

322
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:29,129
They ask this question.

323
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,529
I'll also ask these depending on who you're talking to, what's

324
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,509
going to power these things?

325
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,808
Right, will it be the APIs?

326
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,719
Will it just be MCP? You know, there's been a whole lot of

327
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,750
conversation around there around whether or not MCP is

328
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,320
going to,

329
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,139
uh, eliminate the need for APIs,

330
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:44,629
right? I, I don't think so,

331
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,769
um, but,

332
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:48,090
you know, maybe they're asking this question.

333
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,750
Direct data access, real-time data, who knows, right?

334
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,989
There's a lot of questions around this that are being

335
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:53,509
asked.

336
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:55,678
But our feeling

337
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:57,320
is that you don't wanna start there,

338
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,000
right? The reality is like all this is, this is changing

339
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,678
rapidly.

340
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:02,219
Every week,

341
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:04,729
there's some new thing someone

342
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:05,798
is telling you to do,

343
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,359
right? As it pertains to AI

344
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,509
and AI and agentic application development,

345
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:13,029
right? And so our feeling is that look, no matter what kinds of

346
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,649
applications you'll need to, to use AI to build,

347
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,769
no matter what's going to fuel them.

348
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,349
The relationship will be there, something to

349
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:20,918
solve.

350
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,479
These things are gonna change a lot on the right

351
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,139
and left.

352
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,639
There is a consistent problem for the

353
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,779
organization to solve, and it is this thing in the middle.

354
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,519
Is this connectivity layer in

355
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,379
the middle, what we call

356
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:35,500
the connectivity layer of AI

357
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:37,119
and we think

358
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:40,158
we've seen in practice with with customers

359
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,119
that when we start here,

360
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:44,538
we start building a flexible, secure,

361
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,649
reliable, resilient layer that

362
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,099
can adapt to the changes over here on the right and left,

363
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,580
this is when the organization can truly proceed into

364
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,428
this genic era

365
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,538
with confidence.

366
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,359
OK, well that sounds fine. Maybe you believe me, maybe

367
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,408
you don't. If you don't, let's just talk after. I'm gonna

368
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:00,168
try and convince you.

369
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,599
But if you do, the question should be, what do I do? OK,

370
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,889
what, what is this AI connectivity layer? How do

371
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:05,489
I approach this?

372
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:08,690
OK, let's think about what an AI connectivity platform could

373
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,340
look like.

374
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,090
Right, I think about it in terms of 5 pillars.

375
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,080
First pillar,

376
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,168
build pillar.

377
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,428
All these resources, all the fuel, it's

378
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:19,769
going to power these applications.

379
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,918
We still have to go fast, right? How do we, how do we enable

380
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,960
the builders to quickly design, test,

381
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,779
debug

382
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:29,038
all these resources, and the integration patterns

383
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,538
and connections between them or between these AI

384
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:32,558
applications and these resources.

385
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:35,250
Take something like MCP. How do we, how do we test

386
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,288
the consistency, the reliability, the accuracy

387
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,788
of these transactions?

388
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:43,308
How do we test the relationship between the server and the API, the

389
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:44,038
server and the event?

390
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,529
How do we test these things? How do we build these things? How do we ship

391
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,219
these things quickly?

392
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,219
But once again, remember,

393
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,259
security's a problem. Speed, cost, risk. These

394
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,308
are the three things that I talk about all the time. How do we

395
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:57,500
make sure that we mitigate

396
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,918
risk properly?

397
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,090
This means how do we centrally

398
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,090
and implement

399
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:04,269
standards

400
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:05,649
around exposure

401
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,070
of these resources and access

402
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,190
to these resources

403
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,840
for the agents, for these AI applications,

404
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:15,048
right? Third pillar, discover.

405
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:17,590
We've built the thing, now we're running the thing, it doesn't mean

406
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,668
that whatever needs to consume it can actually find

407
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,580
it. Right, we've

408
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,460
still not done a good job for the human consumers,

409
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,599
oftentimes.

410
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,719
Right now we have this new kind of consumer, this non-human

411
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,399
consumer, this agentic consumer.

412
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,349
Human consumers will still matter for sure.

413
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,788
Both need to be able to find these things.

414
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,428
For two reasons.

415
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,548
One, for the sake of building on top

416
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,548
of it. So think about for the, the consumption

417
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,788
use case, right? How do I package up

418
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:47,129
MCP server, how do I package up, um,

419
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:49,308
or agents even, how do I package up the APIs

420
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,788
and event data as proper self-service

421
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:54,330
products with all the documentation,

422
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,750
all the self-service registration, the ability to try

423
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,859
it, the ability to have a credentials

424
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:01,168
provision to start using, once again, all in a self-service,

425
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,200
seamless manner. But that's just the first reason why

426
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,269
discovery matters. The second reason.

427
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,950
Brings us into our 3rd pillar or 4th pillar

428
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,119
rather, is govern.

429
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,658
We have to be able to see everything,

430
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,038
discover what we have across the data

431
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:15,580
path.

432
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,719
See, is it secure? Does it match up with all

433
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,750
of, are you doing the things that match up with all those

434
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,029
uh bullet points on those governance memos?

435
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,308
Right, are we doing security the way that we've agreed upon? Are we doing

436
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:27,869
resilience the way that we've agreed upon?

437
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,139
Dirty little secret of MCP is that right now it's

438
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,149
actually not that much of a secret based on the conversations

439
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:33,658
I've had.

440
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,330
We've got a lot of individual engineers running around

441
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,379
spinning up their own MCP servers on their local

442
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:38,979
machines.

443
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,649
Do we have to do that, we have to go through that phase.

444
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:43,450
Don't get me wrong.

445
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:46,048
Once again, we're experimenting, we're figuring this stuff out, but

446
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,830
what about standards for MCP server

447
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,989
generation, server development?

448
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,649
We have to be able to find these things.

449
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,519
Measure these things,

450
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,320
measure specifically their compliance with our standards,

451
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,168
and then automate best practices and guardrails

452
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,210
once again across the entirety of the data

453
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,690
path. This brings us

454
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,548
To the 5th pillar.

455
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,029
I'm realizing I'm blowing through this, you all will not

456
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,308
be here for an hour unless everyone,

457
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,750
anyone has a question, but monetize, there's

458
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,668
plenty to say about this.

459
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,440
Remember that margin's erosion number.

460
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:18,178
When people here,

461
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,989
especially API monetization, they think revenue.

462
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,519
So some folks will think chargeback for sure. Both

463
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,428
matter, right? Both of these things matter.

464
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,298
We must,

465
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,538
if we're gonna fix the margin problem,

466
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:29,700
first

467
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,558
start with proper cost governance.

468
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,239
Yes, this can be charged back and cost sharing

469
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:35,879
internally,

470
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,678
but it starts with being able to see consumption.

471
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,798
Define entitlements for these various

472
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:44,139
resources. Remember all the resources LLMs,

473
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,759
the agent,

474
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,379
LLMMCP API event.

475
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:48,418
Define entitlements,

476
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,058
meter in real time, I cannot.

477
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,058
Emphasize enough how much that real-time

478
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,139
qualification matters. We can't

479
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:56,918
wait a week,

480
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,210
right, to see how many tokens have been consumed,

481
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:01,509
how many APIs have been called, how many times.

482
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:03,859
Real-time metering against those entitlements.

483
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,000
And then be able to pair that with enforcement

484
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,759
and control.

485
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,809
Must be able to see it,

486
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:10,949
measure it,

487
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,170
enforce

488
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:13,289
controls

489
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:16,009
in relation to accordance with what you see and what you measure.

490
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,500
But that's just the cost control. Remember, margins has that

491
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,549
other part which is top line revenue gen, right?

492
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:24,519
It's our belief that there's a massive monetization

493
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,618
potential here. I think that

494
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,958
every single white line

495
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:29,999
on that data path slide earlier

496
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,618
is potential monetization, depending on of course the

497
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,898
space, the use case, the potential consumer. I

498
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:36,167
was talking to, uh,

499
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:38,317
I was out in Australia, uh,

500
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:40,968
for about 2.5 weeks, about 2, 3-ish

501
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:43,178
weeks ago, speaking to a lot of organizations

502
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,739
about what they're doing with, with AI

503
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,198
and one of them, it was really interesting.

504
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,150
They're horrified

505
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,848
about the cost implications of

506
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:53,949
what right now are these external agents. So

507
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,209
there are agents once again external to their

508
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:56,789
company

509
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,670
that right now are, you know, they're, they're scraping

510
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,809
to go get the information that this

511
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,848
particular, uh, company can provide

512
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:05,930
or its travel data for the most part.

513
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,059
They know that they wanna expose this stuff in a more

514
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,250
standard manner. They don't wanna do the whole scrapey

515
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,858
eye thing,

516
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,750
right? They want to expose it as proper APIs,

517
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,979
proper MCPs, well, really a BMCP service for the

518
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:17,900
agents, right?

519
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:20,578
But they're horrified as to how much this will cost.

520
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,108
So once again, they don't control those external agents,

521
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,410
right? They don't, they don't own those.

522
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,650
They don't build them, they don't see how they're built,

523
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,979
right? They're so, they're so

524
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:31,140
horrified horrified about how much this costs and controlling

525
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,299
the cost of this, this resource consumption that didn't

526
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,449
even take a second to ask them, could we actually make

527
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,848
money from this.

528
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,259
Clearly these agents that are being built, they need this

529
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,289
data. I could probably

530
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:41,949
charge for that,

531
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,088
right? Maybe, not all the time, but maybe.

532
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,529
And we talked through this and it turns out, yes, there actually might be

533
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,689
a very interesting use case here for

534
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,759
them. So let's approach margins

535
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,799
from both ends, and it's not just the MCP server.

536
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:53,979
Once again you think about that.

537
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,818
If you are an organization that has a

538
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,059
nice

539
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,289
unified governed API program

540
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,719
and those APIs are sitting there exposing a bunch of business

541
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,858
logic and data.

542
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,108
Any consumer

543
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,529
might need an agent or whatever else,

544
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,930
or MCP server,

545
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,430
monetization potential.

546
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,000
So once again, when you're building your platform,

547
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:17,529
all five matter.

548
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:19,868
Build, run, discover,

549
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,930
govern,

550
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,239
monetize,

551
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,799
right? Oh,

552
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,828
supposed to be an animation. Oh well.

553
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,729
The thing we're supposed to say, but it must be unified,

554
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,269
it must be unified.

555
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:33,348
Remember

556
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,108
the statistics from earlier margins erosion,

557
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,650
cost issues, risk issues. It's

558
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,949
a fragmentation problem.

559
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,529
We can continue experimenting with a bunch of different

560
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:43,709
tools, but at the end of the day,

561
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,750
the banker will call at some point,

562
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,250
right? We have to clean this up. We have to

563
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,368
think about how we take a unified approach to all five

564
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:51,088
of these pillars.

565
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,549
I have some perspectives as to to how

566
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,098
organizations can do this.

567
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:57,789
Once again, like I said, I'm not gonna pitch,

568
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:58,709
we can talk after

569
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,289
or we can talk about it any questions at the end because hopefully

570
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:02,049
you'll have some.

571
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,979
But I'm going to leave you with

572
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,328
this. Once

573
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:07,949
again, speed,

574
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,130
we want to go fast.

575
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,108
I agree. Uh, the business that figures this stuff out

576
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,449
first, they stand to gain

577
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,568
a lot.

578
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:18,338
I sort of talk in terms of what I call this agentic

579
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:20,390
AI innovation flywheel,

580
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,750
right, where if you are the

581
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,989
organization that can get your stuff out to market

582
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:25,608
first

583
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,650
but also not have to roll a bunch of stuff back

584
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,130
or pay a bunch of fines and fees

585
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:34,049
due to compliance issues and breaches.

586
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,630
And or spend all the money that it takes, right,

587
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,989
to go fix something after it's been rolled out into production, especially

588
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,029
some big glaring issue.

589
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:41,759
So if you go fast,

590
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,789
balance with cost, balance with risk.

591
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,509
But your competitor

592
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,670
doesn't do that and they just go fast

593
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:50,459
and they have to do all those rollbacks and pay all those fines,

594
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,769
right? The organization that gets there right first,

595
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,130
well, they get out, they stay out,

596
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,509
they gobble up more market share, which means

597
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,809
better top line, better margins, more investment

598
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,890
into the speed cost risk, more investment in the speed

599
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,170
cost risk, you see what happens on the opposite

600
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,219
side. I call it the

601
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,670
agentic innovation death spiral

602
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,209
where you go out,

603
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:11,078
you don't prioritize these things,

604
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,318
right? You have to roll back, spend all this money,

605
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:14,838
you lose market share,

606
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,699
which means that, well, now we have less money to put into these

607
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,880
programs and so on and so forth,

608
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:21,799
right? So speed

609
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:22,809
alone,

610
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,539
just a fast way to fail.

611
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:26,598
Speed, cost, risk

612
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,098
across five pillars, across the data path.

613
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,818
Defragment

614
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:33,489
We must defragment,

615
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:35,209
at least in some capacity.

616
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:36,608
I'm not saying it's easy,

617
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:39,150
but the early research says that this is where we have to

618
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,309
go. How do we do this,

619
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:43,299
2 things unify visibility, yes.

620
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,118
A lot of people and when I show that data path slide, they'll

621
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:48,759
say, OK, well we have monitoring. It's like, OK, that's great.

622
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,219
Do monitoring, do observability, that's awesome.

623
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,209
But you must unify visibility of these things and

624
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:55,118
enforcement

625
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,729
of controls, best practices, guardrails.

626
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:00,868
And I'll actually leave you with this.

627
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,858
This is a quote, not for me,

628
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,358
oops, but

629
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,500
from that report,

630
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,858
the 2025 state of AI cost governance report

631
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,279
where I got all these numbers on margins erosion

632
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,799
and what's causing it.

633
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,140
This is the whole flywheel and

634
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:17,500
death spiral concept in a quote, right?

635
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:19,930
Stakes couldn't be higher.

636
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,130
AI genic stuff is going from nice to have

637
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,759
to must have, at least it will.

638
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,868
The folks that master these things

639
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,868
will protect the margins while competitors watch profits disappear.

640
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:31,670
I'm not trying to be a doomer.

641
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,130
I might sound like one.

642
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,239
But I'm not. Look,

643
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,259
This is a massive opportunity. This is not just talking

644
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,160
about how bad

645
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,118
things are. This means that

646
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:43,199
everyone's struggling with this.

647
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,449
Everyone's having a hard time.

648
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,959
Once again, the opportunity is for the organizations that

649
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,259
can get it right,

650
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:50,539
right? They're the ones that,

651
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,039
quite frankly, I, I think stand to dominate the

652
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,118
space in the specific industry and verbal

653
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:56,118
vertical that they're in.

654
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,209
Which is something that is,

655
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:00,949
especially a lot of times technical teams who are trying to

656
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:02,949
figure out how to get internal buy-in, right,

657
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,568
get budget,

658
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,108
uh, get influence to go build these things. What's

659
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:08,108
something we can take to the top, right? This is

660
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,368
something that could define

661
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,769
the next decade

662
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,390
of the businesses, the companies that you all work at, you

663
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,750
all work at's success.

664
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:18,078
That's all I got.
