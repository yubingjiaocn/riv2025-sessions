1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,543
- Okay, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,530
Thank you for making the time.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,720
I know it's quite a taxing few days,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,630
so appreciate you guys coming out.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,170
And, yeah, today's focus is really about

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,510
talking about how we simplify solutions.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,510
So, focus is on complexity
of customer experience.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,960
And how we are working with AWS

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,980
to really simplify and
make that effortless.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,200
So as an introduction,

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,170
I'm Sashen Naidu, the Executive Head

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,020
of our Global Customer
Experience Practice.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,690
And I'm joined by Priyen Pillay.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,270
So Priyen will be joining me in a bit

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,460
and getting into a little bit more detail

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,770
on some of the solutions we're doing,

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,740
as well as the innovation
we are working with with AWS

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,090
and with a few of our clients.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,090
So I'd like to share just
in terms of the agenda,

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,890
a lot about our partnership,

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,350
it's been a fantastic journey.

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,350
So, you know, coming
back to my role at NTT,

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,210
I've been here for 17 years,

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,540
and really been in the contact center

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,740
and customer experience space.

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,170
So once upon a time,

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,710
with our business process
services business,

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,560
looking after contact center operations.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,780
My focus over the last 10 years

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,780
has been with a number of
our different CX partners.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,590
And really, the focus over
the last six years has been,

32
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,400
how can we build solutions and services,

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,380
not just transactional capabilities,

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,343
but really partnering and
building value for clients?

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,250
I'm gonna talk about
digital transformation

36
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,230
and I know it's a, you know, hot topic,

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,120
you guys are discussing it every day.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,470
But I wanna share our thinking

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,480
in terms of what we're seeing,

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,730
some of the challenges we're seeing.

41
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,060
And how we are actually addressing those.

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,980
You know, once again, you know,

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,170
I'd love to just give
you guys some insights

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,320
because it's challenges
that we've experienced,

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,660
and I'm sure you guys
are experiencing similar,

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,843
and how we've actually
worked through those.

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,100
I'll go into a bit of detail
on our Connect portfolio

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,440
and the depth of services,

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,030
really important is we've taken
a full lifecycle approach.

50
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,110
So from concept through to
execution and management,

51
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,443
our focus is really covering
that entire lifecycle.

52
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,810
Another interesting topic is AI agents

53
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,463
versus human agents.

54
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,950
Lots of AI, I think not a day goes by,

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,020
or probably not an hour
goes by without somebody

56
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,210
mentioning AI or agentic AI.

57
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,700
But the reality is that
we're starting to see

58
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,720
a lot of adoption, real use cases.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,050
So I'll take you through
some of the thinking around

60
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,563
where humans are still really important.

61
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,080
On the innovation side,
we've really looked

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,560
at how we can actually address challenges,

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,710
how we can address gaps in
terms of the current solution.

64
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,510
So I wanna go through some
of what we've done as NTT.

65
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,880
But, more importantly, all
of these have been born

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,453
out of client challenges
that we need to address.

67
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,440
Priyen will go through a lot more about

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,000
how Amazon Connect has
really changed the landscape

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,500
from CCAS to composable CX solutions,

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,440
and why Amazon Connect is so different

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,543
when we talk about customer experience.

72
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,340
He'll also talk to a lot
more of the innovation,

73
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,130
IP and accelerators that we've built,

74
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,670
in the specific use cases
where we've deployed it,

75
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,560
across different verticals.

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,510
And just to give you guys some insights

77
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,453
in terms of what we've
done and how we've done it.

78
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,190
Priyen will also go through
some of the use cases.

79
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,010
You know, for me it's important

80
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,370
to talk about theoretical solutions.

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,880
Most important is, where
have we put it into practice?

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,143
What value is it adding? What
problems is it addressing?

83
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,890
And Priyen will also go through
the agentic AI framework

84
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,310
because what's really important is,

85
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,310
AI has to be a native part of
any solution going forward.

86
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,290
It's not an afterthought,
it's not an add-on,

87
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,820
it's got to be part and parcel

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,520
of those initial conversations

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
and how you build out solutions.

90
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,530
So if I just share

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,473
a little bit more about our partnership,

92
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,960
when I talk about a consultative approach,

93
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,770
you know, as NTT and I
mentioned my background

94
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,580
in contact centers and operations,

95
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,600
we've had over 40 years of experience

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,120
running and operating contact centers.

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,850
And this is really important
because our approach

98
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,730
has not been one from a technology,

99
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,430
or systems integrator perspective.

100
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,250
But how do you consume that technology?

101
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,160
How does it add value to your operations?

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,320
And operations from an agent

103
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,800
through to supervisor,
through to management.

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,500
What we've really done and, you know,

105
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,130
deliberately we focus more on advisory

106
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,840
than typical consulting,

107
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,540
because it's not about
art of the possible.

108
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,990
How do you build out focused

109
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,990
advisory capabilities based
on client requirements?

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Typically what we do is we
do one or two week workshops.

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,700
And the focus is, how can we add value

112
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,073
through the adoption of technology?

113
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,630
If we look at AI, once again,

114
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,640
I know it needs no introduction,

115
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,280
but AI, we've seen

116
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,230
especially in contact
center, is multiple layers.

117
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,050
So, you know, everybody's
talking about it now,

118
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,070
but we've seen it.

119
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,800
You guys have seen it in
the contact center space,

120
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,060
robotics and process automation, IVR.

121
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,470
So when I look at AI, gen AI,

122
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,500
agentic AI, it's really the evolution

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,950
of where we started off with RPA and IVR.

124
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,950
In fact, you know, agentic
AI to me is replacing

125
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,980
what we've done for a
number of years with IVR.

126
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,670
Sure, it's completely autonomous

127
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,950
depending on the different use cases,

128
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,800
a lot more insights and analytics.

129
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,630
But it's really important,

130
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,563
is how we actually build
out those solutions.

131
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,240
And when we look at customer experience,

132
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,647
another really important,
you know, everybody says,

133
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:12,270
"Oh, contact center," I said "No,"

134
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,750
'cause customer experience
is so much more.

135
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,840
It is about the entire ecosystem,

136
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,610
of which CCAS is usually one
of the foundational components.

137
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,410
And that is where, once
again, Connect as a platform.

138
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,180
You know, a few years ago,

139
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,720
there was a lot of hesitation
in terms of adopting Connect.

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,377
And the reason for that
is a lot of people said,

141
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:38,910
"well, you've got to have a
lot of DevOps capabilities

142
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,647
and it's a black box."

143
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,210
But what we've seen is
that a lot of the maturity

144
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,840
that has been put into
delivering use cases.

145
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,950
And if you look at the
entire AWS ecosystem,

146
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,950
all of the reporting and
analytics, all of the intelligence,

147
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,480
all of that wrapped around Connect

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,783
is where Amazon differentiates.

149
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,170
Another interesting topic and, you know,

150
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,160
I wanna talk a lot more,
I'll get into some detail,

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,893
around AI-driven sourcing.

152
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,260
How do you use AI

153
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,893
to drive your sourcing
and people strategy?

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,313
One of the reasons that AI
is actually really prevalent

155
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,990
and adding value in the
customer experience space

156
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,980
is because, you know, we've seen the trend

157
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,980
of onshoring to offshoring
to lower cost geographies.

158
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,700
But now AI has completely
shifted that mindset.

159
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,030
You can do onshoring,
especially in verticals where,

160
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,550
you know, there's highly sensitive data,

161
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,540
and there's reasons in terms
of being able to manage,

162
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,090
you know, data sensitivity.

163
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,670
But AI can drive that out

164
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,310
with significant cost savings.

165
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,360
And I'm gonna get into a lot more detail.

166
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,320
A focus around industry
specific CX solutions,

167
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,320
and this is where service
as software comes in,

168
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,160
where we're looking at
deep domain expertise.

169
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,220
We're looking at the platforms and tools

170
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,590
that deliver a particular outcome.

171
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,260
You know, people talk about outcomes

172
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,080
and that's another fantastic buzzword,

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,760
but how do you deliver that?

174
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,620
So our focus has been
creating those solutions

175
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,440
that are not generic,
but they are specific.

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,180
So if we look at a particular vertical,

177
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,600
like financial services or insurance,

178
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,160
some of the things that we are doing

179
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
and working with clients is,

180
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,050
how do you focus on delivering

181
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,360
those services, those outcomes?

182
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,270
So it could be, in the insurance world,

183
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,040
focus on processing
claims or policy admin.

184
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,700
It is not about seats and licenses

185
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,673
and processes, it's about outcomes.

186
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,690
And then on the innovation side,

187
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,040
I really wanna share, and I
mentioned, what we've done,

188
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,400
how we've done it, and
how it pieces together

189
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,113
in these broader solutions.

190
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,740
If I look at digital
transformation and, you know,

191
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,680
these are interesting themes.

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,490
So elevating CX.

193
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,093
Everybody talks about
hyper-personalization,

194
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,550
how do you do that?

195
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,550
Well, with the right solutions,

196
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,670
access to the data in real-time

197
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,493
with AI natively embedded.

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,289
You can make data either available

199
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,270
to an agentic AI solution,

200
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,530
or through to a person

201
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,830
where you're augmenting
that person's capabilities.

202
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,830
So, you know, really AWS's ability

203
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,950
to deliver full stack
composable solutions.

204
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,280
And that word to me is really key,

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,440
the composability of the solution.

206
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,650
You could start with a
foundational solution,

207
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,120
and build it up

208
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,010
based on requirements that
change, new business systems.

209
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,010
And as we see businesses starting
to evolve their strategy,

210
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,743
you need platforms that are
gonna support that evolution.

211
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,540
If I look at migration to modern CX,

212
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,920
we've seen the move from on-prem

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,710
to hosted to cloud native.

214
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,790
You know, even on cloud native,

215
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,970
everybody has a different
view of what cloud native is.

216
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,740
But what's really important
is, it's not just about cloud,

217
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,740
it's about AI native
cloud, it's about AI first.

218
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,690
How do you build these solutions

219
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,873
with the right insights
and the right capabilities?

220
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Another really important
theme and capability

221
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,020
is having a tightly integrated solution.

222
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,960
And I'm gonna talk about
total experience in a minute.

223
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,960
So it is about delivering
customer experience,

224
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,960
employee experience, digital experience,

225
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,550
all coming together,
delivering it with voice,

226
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,980
delivering it with managed services.

227
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,903
And putting it together
as one cohesive solution.

228
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,030
And I think last, but certainly not least,

229
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,520
we tend to forget about

230
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,940
human-centric capabilities,
human in the loop.

231
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,690
As much as we've seen AI,
we've seen adoption of AI,

232
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,070
you guys have seen the announcements,

233
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,240
I think they're fantastic in
terms of what AWS is doing,

234
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
the level of autonomy.

235
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,260
But make no mistake,

236
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,180
we are gonna continue
to have people engaged,

237
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,330
but elevating the role

238
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,570
that people are gonna play
in different solutions,

239
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,850
especially in customer experience.

240
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,260
I'm gonna talk to a lot more

241
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,690
of where we're seeing the roles change

242
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,690
to more of supervisory,
compliance, governance.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,960
And, really, how people are supporting

244
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,180
a lot of the quality outputs

245
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,783
that want AI and agentic
AI solutions to deliver.

246
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,453
So I briefly mentioned
it, total experience.

247
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,380
If you guys are not familiar, you know,

248
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,850
when we talk about experience,

249
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,640
and CX is something
that's close to my heart,

250
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,110
as you can probably tell,

251
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,170
but it's not just about
customer experience.

252
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,860
It's about employee experience,
it's about the agents

253
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,860
that enable that engagement
with your end clients.

254
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,240
It's about the AI and the
experience that they deliver.

255
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,940
So when we talk about total experience,

256
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,330
it is about stitching
together what we would call

257
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,270
customer experience, employee experience,

258
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,140
user experience, digital experience.

259
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,700
And piecing all of that together.

260
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,700
So having a platform that
is tightly integrated.

261
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,730
More importantly, natively able

262
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,400
to deliver all of these solutions

263
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,280
means that you can
actually deliver solutions

264
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,280
with a combination of
people, AI, agentic AI,

265
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,503
but deliver it as a seamless experience.

266
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,730
So that's great, but
how do you achieve that?

267
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,210
So some of the challenges we're seeing,

268
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,990
and it's still a reality, tech debt.

269
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,020
We still have a lot of on-prem

270
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,620
or hosted solutions, lots of mainframe.

271
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,840
So one of the biggest challenges

272
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,300
is the legacy infrastructure
that is still prevalent

273
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,173
in a lot of large enterprises.

274
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,443
Lack of gen AI and CX skills at scale.

275
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,080
We are all talking about it,

276
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,410
and there's usually a small
subset of these capabilities,

277
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,593
but it is not easily accessible.

278
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,410
We see a lot of promise and hype

279
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,990
of what AI can deliver,

280
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,900
but in some instances,
we're not necessarily seeing

281
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,270
the actual ROI calcs.

282
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,140
Or, you know, there's a lot of POC

283
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,280
or POV solutions, but it's not
necessarily being taken out

284
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,723
and scaled into production.

285
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,030
Complexity, most clients

286
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,343
have multi-vendor solutions,

287
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:19,740
a combination of legacy,
cloud, different vendors.

288
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,260
And whilst there's a
lot of interoperability

289
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,980
and integration, there is
still a lot of complexity

290
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,733
in terms of how you stitch
all of that together.

291
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,080
Probably the most important

292
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,490
is around governance,
security, and compliance.

293
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,950
We've seen one of the
biggest challenges is,

294
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm sure you guys have seen examples,

295
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,400
where AI has completely changed

296
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,540
the data that we can make
accessible to clients,

297
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,520
data that we make accessible

298
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,150
to our own agents and employees.

299
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,813
And being able to manage and
govern that is really key.

300
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,910
So I wanna go through,

301
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,900
what does our AWS portfolio look like?

302
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,780
What is a typical
engagement with a client?

303
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,290
So we do everything from advisory,

304
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,540
which I've spoken about.

305
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,870
And on the advisory, very important,

306
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,200
the focus is not about features

307
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,980
and capabilities with CCAS and CX.

308
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,960
The focus is about understanding
business requirements.

309
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,530
We look at customer experience maturity,

310
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,083
we look at CX benchmarking.

311
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,640
We look at specific use cases,

312
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,920
because ultimately the technology

313
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
and all of the capabilities

314
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,650
needs to address business challenges.

315
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,990
On the implementation side,

316
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,850
focus is on professional services.

317
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,870
So all of the build and
implementation capabilities.

318
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,110
But the professional
services are really important

319
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,520
because it is not just
about configuration,

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,070
it is about customization.

321
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,420
It is about delivering bespoke solutions,

322
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,420
relevant, tailored to our
client's specific requirements.

323
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,620
No matter what anybody says,

324
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,593
we've never seen two solutions alike.

325
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:30,630
It comes back to the ecosystem,

326
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,460
it comes back to the requirements,

327
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,670
it comes back to the different verticals

328
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,853
and your specific business drivers.

329
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,710
And coming back to the
theme of effortless CX,

330
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,170
I know that is a charged statement,

331
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,370
'cause CX is anything but
effortless, highly complicated.

332
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,300
A lot of you here nodding,
so I take it that you know

333
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,630
exactly, you know, how
challenging that can be.

334
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,630
But our focus has been on,

335
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,770
how do we simplify that?

336
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,770
So managing and operating,
building out managed services,

337
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,100
and I'll go through a lot
more of what that means.

338
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,100
But everything from
what we'll call day two,

339
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,980
post-implementation, how do you manage it?

340
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,150
How do you operate it?

341
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,630
How do you make sure that
it's actually delivering

342
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,013
what we set out to deliver?

343
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,893
And on the managed services side,

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,590
what we've tried to do is really take away

345
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,320
a lot of that complexity.

346
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,430
So standard deployment with Connect,

347
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,213
we have global service
desks with local presence.

348
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,840
We've got level 1, 2, 3 support.

349
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,933
Most importantly we have,

350
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,560
and this is an interesting one,

351
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,580
unlimited MACDs, or
moves, ads, and changes.

352
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,360
Because in the contact center
it's not a static environment,

353
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,780
it's a dynamic environment that
needs changes all the time.

354
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,977
And what we found is that when we deliver

355
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:20,130
our managed service and clients
say, "Hey, listen, you know,

356
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,050
change my call flows, my IVR,

357
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,627
you know, change my bots."

358
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,430
It was contradictory to say we provided

359
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,490
as a managed service,
but every single time,

360
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,130
we need to build out a statement of work

361
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,620
and there's a whole process to do

362
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,770
what should be basic changes.

363
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,090
Or not necessarily basic,

364
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,900
but essential changes to a contact center.

365
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,010
So the managed service is really key,

366
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,463
making sure that you
got predictable costs,

367
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,590
you've got access to the
right skills, support,

368
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,260
full visibility into your CX environment.

369
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,190
So we make available a
portal where all of the data,

370
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,090
reporting on the entire
solution is available

371
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,003
and accessible to our clients.

372
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,623
And fundamentally, what
we've also done is,

373
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,740
how do we know that the
solution and services

374
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,860
are actually delivering as intended?

375
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,890
So standard part of the solution

376
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,400
is synthetic testing, or bots,

377
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,790
that emulate our clients and customers.

378
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,610
So whether it is on voice
or any digital channel,

379
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,610
we can dial in, listen
to the IVR, step through,

380
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,240
really emulating what an end
customer experience would be.

381
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,370
Because, you know, it doesn't help

382
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,180
whether it's a vendor
issue, a config issue,

383
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,000
or whatever it is, if there's impact,

384
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,110
we need to know about it,

385
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,160
and we need to know about it proactively.

386
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,350
So, very interesting topic,

387
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,463
AI agents versus human agents.

388
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,660
Well, I think, you know, it
goes without saying, right,

389
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,720
on the AI agent side,
we are starting to see

390
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,720
a lot of routine,
high-volume, scalable tasks.

391
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,370
And this is where we're starting to see

392
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,440
the most amount of adoption.

393
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,030
Frontline automation, some
of the personalization

394
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,670
and tailored solutions I've touched on.

395
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,420
But really where AI agents

396
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,453
is replacing traditional IVRs,

397
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,523
it can do it at the fraction of a cost,

398
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,270
far better experience.

399
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,840
I mean, how frustrating
is it to dial into an IVR,

400
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,370
versus being able to
converse with an AI bot?

401
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,700
So if we look at AI agents,

402
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,930
anything that is simple,
repetitive, predictable.

403
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,190
But we're slowly starting to close the gap

404
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,113
in terms of the level of
complexity and what bots can do.

405
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:20,850
You know, we see it changing
every two to three months.

406
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,680
You know, you guys have
seen over the last few days

407
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,450
in terms of the announcements

408
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,070
and the advancements we're
seeing, it's unbelievable.

409
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,570
What we are actually struggling

410
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,530
is to keep up with that
pace of innovation,

411
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,460
and continuing to adopt and embrace

412
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,230
a lot of the newer capabilities.

413
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,230
But I really believe that the
human agents are here to stay

414
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,750
in a very different,
specific, and focused role.

415
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,721
So handling a lot more of the complexity.

416
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:57,757
You know, somebody asked
me a question around,

417
00:23:57,757 --> 00:24:00,327
"Can AI deliver empathy?"

418
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,660
And it's a very interesting question.

419
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,700
I'm sure you guys have got a view on it.

420
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,690
Well, it can fake empathy really well,

421
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,550
but can it deliver empathy?

422
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,140
Well, it depends.

423
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,140
So handling empathy, you know,

424
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,670
varying transactions,
unpredictable queries,

425
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,580
that is where people and, you know,

426
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,190
we spoke about the various...

427
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,220
Just this morning, Swami spoke about

428
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,930
reinforcement learning, right?

429
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,640
So how do you pull
together people to support,

430
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,553
scale your AI capabilities?

431
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,790
This is one of the innovation

432
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,670
and investments we've
made partnering with AWS.

433
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,450
So really, really
interesting and, you know,

434
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,030
hopefully this will
resonate with you guys.

435
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,060
We've seen, in the contact
center and CX space

436
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,130
over the last few years,

437
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,340
everybody went to digital, omnichannel,

438
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,510
chat, email, social, decline of voice.

439
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,310
But the decline of voice wasn't as great

440
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,140
as everybody thought it would be.

441
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,470
The interesting thing is
that over the last 12 months,

442
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,120
we've seen a significant
resurgence of voice, why?

443
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,420
In fact voice is becoming

444
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,410
the new dominant digital channel.

445
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,850
We've always had IVR and
we have conversational IVR,

446
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,230
but it's frustrating.

447
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,060
You know, you guys dial in

448
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,790
and you speak to this
computer-automated voice

449
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,740
and you've got to wait for it.

450
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,740
But if you use any of the
newer agentic AI solutions,

451
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,150
it is intuitive, low latency.

452
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,670
You can have a fluid conversation,

453
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,803
you can interrupt it at any time.

454
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,050
And all of a sudden, it is very different.

455
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,020
You can talk with whatever dialect,

456
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,090
you can talk in different languages,

457
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,520
but the most important point

458
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,270
is the fact that it is low latency.

459
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,160
And it is no different

460
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,640
to you having a conversation
with another person.

461
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,746
So what we've done as NTT is built out

462
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:26,746
an agentic AI comms gateway
that stitches together

463
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,120
and enables voice solutions.

464
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,110
So we can have

465
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,960
all of the security,

466
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,190
all of the voice managed securely.

467
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,940
And the ability to connect

468
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,270
to different systems for orchestration,

469
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,270
different LLM models, and not just voice,

470
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,950
but adding in other channels.

471
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,160
So just to share with you
guys what that looks like.

472
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,020
Because in any contact center,

473
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,400
and it's not just about Connect,
Connect is absolutely core,

474
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,790
but if we look at some of
the broader ISV partners

475
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,790
that Amazon has, Genesis, Nice, et cetera,

476
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,140
being able to stitch together voice

477
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,860
with various AI use cases,

478
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,150
pulling data from ITSM, CRM,

479
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,670
really any line of business system,

480
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:34,380
and managing that and making
it available in real-time.

481
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,140
Because what we've seen is that
everybody wants to build out

482
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,320
these use cases, but where do you start?

483
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
How do you get the voice?
How do you secure it?

484
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,010
Who's gonna manage it?

485
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,160
And once again, you may
have multiple partners,

486
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,970
multiple carriers, multiple systems.

487
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,020
So the focus is really on the ability

488
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,763
to create repeatable,
composable solutions.

489
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,183
AI-driven sourcing, and I think, you know,

490
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm gonna hand over to
Priyen in a few minutes.

491
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,600
But I wanna focus on, what
does AI-driven sourcing mean?

492
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,910
Well, contact centers have
been people-driven forever.

493
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,583
I spoke about offshoring,

494
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,300
everybody's familiar with
onshoring or near-shoring.

495
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,980
But what we've seen

496
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,420
is that it's no longer about people costs,

497
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,650
because you can build an agentic AI bot

498
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,690
that is completely autonomous.

499
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,690
Or it can manage several solutions,

500
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,760
depending on the level of complexity,

501
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,873
and then hand over to an
agent with full context.

502
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,650
So to put that into perspective,

503
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,870
when you run a contact center,

504
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,480
typically everybody focuses on things

505
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,180
like average handle time.

506
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,200
And the average handle time

507
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,090
is usually between four to six minutes,

508
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,310
depending on the vertical

509
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,370
or the nature of transaction,
the level of complexity.

510
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,730
If I just look at some of
the use cases out of Shed,

511
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,593
Q and A, or knowledge use case,

512
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,760
based on the cost, and
onshore is really based

513
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,510
on North America and some of Europe.

514
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:29,220
So based on the handle time
of that four to six minutes,

515
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,143
the cost of those agents,
it's usually about six to $10.

516
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:40,310
And we've seen it over
the last 15, 20 years,

517
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,850
offshoring to low cost
geographies, fantastic.

518
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,040
Significantly lower cost, you can see,

519
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,330
typically, three to four, maybe $5.

520
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,250
But it comes with its own
challenges in terms of language,

521
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,483
in terms of being able
to represent brands.

522
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,370
And now we've got agentic AI solutions

523
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,900
that can really deliver it
at the fraction of a cost.

524
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,270
But it's not just about the cost,

525
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,930
it increases things like
customer satisfaction,

526
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,850
net promoter score.

527
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,950
In some instances I mentioned,

528
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,370
certain industries, public sector,

529
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,550
healthcare, financial services,

530
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,690
they may or may not wanna
offshore based on sensitivity,

531
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,870
based on regulations that
they need to comply to.

532
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,680
So what we seeing is that agentic AI

533
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,260
can deliver these solutions.

534
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,460
And one of the most important use cases

535
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,170
is in the contact center,

536
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,950
because there's demonstrable value.

537
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,620
You know, you can have a
look at a business case

538
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,770
and there's immediate value
in terms of what you can do,

539
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,603
how you can do it.

540
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:59,190
Because the first thing when
you have conversations is,

541
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,360
what is the business case?

542
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,180
What is the return on investment?
When will we realize that?

543
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,690
When you have people costs,

544
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,690
there is very real, tangible results.

545
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,640
And I know that it opens
up a broader question

546
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,770
in terms of the people management.

547
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,820
But we've seen that a lot of enterprises

548
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,230
are repurposing and upskilling

549
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,590
a lot of those agents to do higher level,

550
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,460
higher complexity, more customization.

551
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,900
More personalized, you know,
solutions or engagement where,

552
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,180
like I said, empathy is needed.

553
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,943
So, very interesting space.

554
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,710
Really important is that these solutions

555
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,520
are being deployed,
being deployed at scale,

556
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
and the value that we're seeing,

557
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
the value to our clients,

558
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,180
and ultimately passing that on

559
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,313
to their end customers is phenomenal.

560
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,590
So, last slide and I'll
hand over to Priyen

561
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,320
to get into a lot more
detail around the innovation

562
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,263
and specifically what
we're doing with Connect.

563
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,570
Another example of what
we've done is Foresight.

564
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,040
This is our own IP as NTT

565
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,200
Real-time speech analytics.

566
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,093
We hold quite a few patents on it.

567
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,083
Our speech engine, all powered by AWS.

568
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,360
The ability to do true real-time.

569
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,590
So you know, you could be an
agent in the contact center.

570
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,260
Firstly, it could be a highly
compliant contact center,

571
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,300
where if the agent
didn't say, "Hey, listen,

572
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,640
I need to tell you this call is recorded."

573
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,350
The agent may make a recommendation

574
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,080
that is actually against a company policy,

575
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,090
immediately can be flagged.

576
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,040
You may have an irate customer
who says, "Hey, listen,

577
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,630
this is the third time I'm calling in and,

578
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,330
you know, I'm really upset."

579
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,680
In real-time, it flags certain keywords.

580
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,660
It can pass it on to a supervisor

581
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,910
who can either coach the agent.

582
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,837
Or more importantly, just
get into the call and say,

583
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:12,930
"Hey, listen, how can I assist?

584
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,970
Let me help you."

585
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,910
Post COVID, everybody's
seen remote working,

586
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,680
it's the new norm.

587
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,020
So how do you manage contact center agents

588
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,230
who are no longer
physically in front of you?

589
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,260
As a supervisor, I could walk
the contact center floor,

590
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,860
I've got 10 to 15 agents,
and I could manage them.

591
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,180
Now, they could be sitting
anywhere in the world.

592
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,750
So some of the tools we've
got, like virtual seat map,

593
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,627
it builds you a virtual
map of your agents,

594
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,320
what they're saying, what
they're doing, keywords.

595
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,770
And very simple green, amber, red.

596
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,360
I can understand where
the agents need support,

597
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,660
where they need nurturing.

598
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,820
I can have a look at who's
the best performing agent

599
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,930
based on what they do, the
FAQs, the knowledge base.

600
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,900
And I can use that for training purposes.

601
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,900
So a lot of that insights is
taken and fed back in terms of,

602
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,780
how do you improve the training,
the real-time management?

603
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,010
So just another example
of how we are building

604
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,973
these solutions for real use cases.

605
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,130
With that, I'd love to
introduce Priyen Pillay.

606
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,880
And he's gonna go into a lot
more detail on what we're doing

607
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,303
and how we're doing it
with Connect, thank you.

608
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:44,304
(congregants applauding)

609
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,890
- Thanks Sash, and good
intro to the topic.

610
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,530
I guess my portion of the presentation

611
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,730
is more on the applications
of what Sashen spoke about

612
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,350
from agentic AI perspective

613
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,500
and the different
technologies that we use.

614
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,350
I guess, to start off,

615
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,810
we've been doing this about nine years now

616
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,180
in terms of Amazon
connecting contact centers

617
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,380
and moving customers from
legacy solutions to the cloud.

618
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,380
So we were there when
there was no agentic AI,

619
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,630
we were there when it was just,

620
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,550
the buzzword was text-to-speech.

621
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,830
So using poly to no longer

622
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,260
have to have prerecorded messages,

623
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,483
that was the exciting bit nine years ago.

624
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,000
Then we moved into the space

625
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,540
of having other bits of innovation in.

626
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,860
So putting Lex in to have

627
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,800
conversational IVR for
predetermined intents.

628
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,530
And then slowly, as the years progressed,

629
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,650
we went into generative AI
and that was the last year,

630
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,900
probably the last 24 months

631
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,510
leading into the new phase of '26.

632
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,220
Essentially, the pattern we've always used

633
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,060
over the last nine years was Lego blocks.

634
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,650
And the reason why we use Lego blocks

635
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,300
is because a lot of people
believe Amazon Connect

636
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,180
is the only service that's
used in your contact center,

637
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,860
and that's brutally wrong.

638
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,000
The average AWS contact center user

639
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
from a enterprise level
uses on average 25 services

640
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,743
in AWS to empower the contact center.

641
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,890
So it's important that
everyone understands

642
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,400
that that's what makes
Amazon Connect powerful,

643
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,040
is the fact that you can
leverage the services around it.

644
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,800
Which is why we take
the Lego block approach,

645
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,770
to say that no two customers
contact centers are the same,

646
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,970
It's because no two customers

647
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,170
have the same business strategy.

648
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,640
If you did, it doesn't make you

649
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,233
a differentiator in the market.

650
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,640
So from an ecosystem perspective,

651
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,950
I guess there's nothing much

652
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,810
that can differentiate partners,

653
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,050
other than the way that
we stitch things together.

654
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,850
So on the left hand side,

655
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,200
you'll see the whole bunch of services.

656
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,450
And I'm not taking,
and NTT won't take any,

657
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,360
credit for the services
that Amazon provide.

658
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,590
They're very good in the market,

659
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,390
they're release things really quickly.

660
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,700
They listen to their partners,
they listen to the customers.

661
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,460
There's been instances where us as NTT

662
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,080
have put innovation bots
or feature enhancements

663
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,200
into their backlog because
of our customers needing

664
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,840
certain future enhancements
in the contact center.

665
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,050
And we've seen realization of that.

666
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,520
Some of the benefits coming out

667
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,610
of the new re:Invent
releases for Amazon Connect

668
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:34,610
around dynamic GUIs and
generative AI voices.

669
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,600
So now you no longer
pick a particular voice,

670
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,100
you can use generative AI
for your text-to-speech.

671
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,910
But essentially, what we've
been doing for the last eight,

672
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,810
nine years was the middle
bits of the Venn diagram.

673
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,620
So we've been building microservices

674
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,510
that stitch the three different parameters

675
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,430
in the contact center together.

676
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,120
The first one is, of
course, the AWS platform.

677
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,620
The second one is any
best-of-breed cloud native tools.

678
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,230
So, again, Amazon doesn't force you

679
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,380
to use everything from Amazon Connect.

680
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,170
You can bring the
best-of-breed, and there's ways

681
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,900
to get it to work seamlessly
in your contact center.

682
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,610
And then the last bit is,

683
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,060
not everyone migrates to
cloud at the same speed.

684
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,240
So you'll see that in most of the cases,

685
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,330
you've got APIs that are
still offered on-premise,

686
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,590
by on-premise gateways.

687
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,880
Not everything has moved to the cloud.

688
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,660
So that integration path between the cloud

689
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,720
and your network is extremely important.

690
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,630
Things like VDI connectivity for voice,

691
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,620
and those type of things.

692
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,150
So we spent the last nine
years building microservices

693
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,650
to stitch everything together.

694
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,720
And as with anything,

695
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
as the years progress,
we got a lot better.

696
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,950
And we've got a lot of automations running

697
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,870
that can make migrations a lot quicker.

698
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,990
However, the caveat is, as we got better

699
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,900
at the existing stuff, there
were new stuff being released.

700
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,643
So it's a continuous cycle.

701
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Some of the areas that were
exciting, (coughs), excuse me.

702
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,710
Some of the areas that were
exciting about five years ago.

703
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,950
So Contact Lens, which
is speech analytics.

704
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,160
Self-service, so getting
more automation in,

705
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,770
so you don't have to wait in queues.

706
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,860
And then some of the
other functionalities,

707
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,360
like chatbots with Lex, et cetera.

708
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,920
So those were innovations
that drove change

709
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,403
into Amazon Connect over the
last potentially five years.

710
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,630
And then we realized that,

711
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,270
to the point I was
saying of microservices,

712
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,650
we then went into thinking
about, how could we safely

713
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,953
deploy contact centers quicker?

714
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,480
How could we reuse
patterns that we've learned

715
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,870
over the various
customers we take care of,

716
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,600
into new customers or
to existing customers

717
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,380
that are a bit slower at
getting to innovation parts?

718
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,460
And that's where we worked

719
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,310
with our infrastructure
team to build NAMS.

720
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,640
So what NAMS is, is essentially,

721
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,760
we first had to believe
in the generative AI

722
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,670
for us to be able to
offer it to our customers.

723
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,270
So what NAMS is, NAMS is a
generative AI release tool

724
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,120
that we use to build packages

725
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,760
of components of contact center.

726
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,320
So what that means is
that we've prepackaged

727
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,540
components that we think are valuable

728
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,057
to customers for innovation,

729
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:40,020
or are valuable to customers
that are moving to the cloud.

730
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,960
Things like dynamic contact center flows,

731
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,260
things like bots for certain

732
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,350
servicing areas in
customers' contact centers.

733
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,960
So we've packaged all of this good stuff

734
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,570
and we've made it available in a catalog,

735
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:59,130
where NAMS is now used
to run it much quicker

736
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,890
and build it dynamically in
different customer environments.

737
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,320
The important bit for
NAMS is the fact that

738
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,720
we've also incorporated security protocols

739
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,190
and security checks, which
allow us to safely deploy it.

740
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:16,190
And allow code to be safely
scanned and become ready

741
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,660
for deployment in the
customer environments.

742
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,240
which then also allows us to use gen AI

743
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,560
to empower our engineers
that are shipped off

744
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,020
at our customers to do
the different deployments.

745
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,390
So, thus, offering quality at scale.

746
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,250
So we started this initiative

747
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,420
and it's an ongoing initiative.

748
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,730
But we started this initiative,

749
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,320
we worked with the generative AI process.

750
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,933
And then we've got to a
point where, you know,

751
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,890
we've eaten our own dog
food, we believe in the tech.

752
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,510
And now, we're going into our customers

753
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,870
to put the generative AI field in

754
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,020
from a CX and UX perspective.

755
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,490
So what we then did is we looked

756
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,220
at all our customers in general.

757
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,720
So I'm gonna quickly skim through

758
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,230
three different customers of
three different landscapes.

759
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,860
Yes, they're FSI, but
different regions of the world,

760
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,790
different customer base.

761
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:13,790
The first one is a very big African FSI

762
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,040
with a large range of customers

763
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,820
of different demographics.

764
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,213
So different earning
potentials, different dialects,

765
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,300
different patterns of spend,

766
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,600
different interaction
patterns, different ages.

767
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,170
So that's the first type of customer.

768
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,630
The second type was also an FSI

769
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,620
that is a lot newer to the market.

770
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:45,483
They're a much younger customer base.

771
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:47,730
They were also for the people,

772
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,970
so they were more of
the lower to mid earners

773
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,843
of the customer base.

774
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,220
And then the last one
is a European bank that,

775
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,220
again, very ambitious, they
had a very mature estate,

776
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,600
they needed to move that to the cloud.

777
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,840
They do have the European
market, so a lot of youngsters

778
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,890
at this customer, a lot
of different dialects

779
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,450
because of the multinationals
that live in the country.

780
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:23,450
So all three of these different
logos had something similar,

781
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,060
even though their passion
of business was different.

782
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,050
It was, how do we service
our customers quicker?

783
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,530
How do we reduce our operational spend?

784
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,530
And how do we ensure
that CX goes up without,

785
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,980
well, CS goes up, but opex goes down,

786
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,750
from a spend perspective?

787
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,590
Which results in the customers in general

788
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,770
wanting one thing, is generative AI.

789
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,920
It's a buzzword, everyone
wants to put generative AI in.

790
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,880
The important bit was,
how do you do it safely?

791
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,960
So in the next slide, it's
gonna be a voice note playing

792
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,520
of one of the bots that we built.

793
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,970
Again, you can make it sound
as realistic as you want,

794
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:09,990
especially with the new release

795
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,670
that came out now at re:Invent.

796
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,680
But what we wanted to figure out is,

797
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,070
what is the correct pattern
between gen AI, agentic AI,

798
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,480
and all these different NLP bots

799
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,760
that customers would've
had when they built Lex,

800
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,283
when Lex was buzzword a couple years ago?

801
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,020
- [AI bot] Hi, I'm (indistinct),
AI service assistant,

802
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,970
how can I help you?

803
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,883
- [Marnus] Hi, can you please
tell me more about NTT?

804
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,300
- [AI bot] NTT Data is a global leader

If you need more specific
details, feel free to ask.

807
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,013
- [Marnus] What services can NTT offer?

808
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,150
- [AI bot] NTT data offers
a wide range of services,

809
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,060

814
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,750
If you need more specific information

815
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,393
about any of these
services, just let me know.

816
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,460
- [Marnus] Thank you for that.

817
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,060
What are the key drivers
of digital transformation

818
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,563
according to NTT Data?

819
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,730
- [AI bot] According to
NTT Data, the key drivers

820
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,110
of digital transformation are
improved customer experience,

821
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,930
operational efficiency,
ability to innovate,

822
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,210
and adapt to market changes.

823
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,880
If you need more details
on any of these drivers,

824
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,873
feel free to ask.

825
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,280
- [Marnus] I was wondering
if we can actually

826
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,000
schedule an appointment
with NTT for a demo?

827
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,070
- [AI bot] Sure, I can help you with that.

828
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,990
Could you please provide
your email address,

829
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,700
so I can look up your contact record

830
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,900
and proceed with
scheduling the appointment?

831
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:56,390
- [Marnus] Okay, that's
marnus.botha@global.ntt.

832
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,040
- [AI bot] Great, I found
your contact record.

833
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,593
What date would you like
to schedule the demo for?

834
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,217
- [Marnus] Tomorrow at around 12.

835
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,760
- [AI bot] The available
time slots for tomorrow

836
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,966
are 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM,

837
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:18,720
12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

838
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,023
Would you like to schedule the
demo for 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM?

839
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,530
- [Marnus] Yep, that's fine.

840
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,147
- [AI bot] Your demo with NTT

841
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:29,460
has been successfully
scheduled for tomorrow

842
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,830
from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM.

843
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,743
If you need any further
assistance, feel free to ask.

844
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,423
- [Marnus] Awesome, thank
you so much. Cheers, goodbye.

845
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,843
- [AI bot] You're
welcome. Have a great day.

846
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,730
- So the voice note is not
meant to be be-all, end-all

847
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,530
of what agentic AI can do.

848
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,040
We understand there's much
better ways to have the bot

849
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,740
to be more human-like,
to be more seamless.

850
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,150
There's varied use cases to both

851
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,640
for agentic AI and generative AI.

852
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,070
But what we tried to do with
that particular use case

853
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,590
was that was built overnight.

854
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,310
We took an engineer, we
gave them particular APIs,

855
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,280
we created dummy APIs
for particular use cases,

856
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,340
simulating readily available APIs

857
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,470
at our customer's workspace.

858
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,103
And we created dummy
profiles which mimicked CRM.

859
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,130
And we asked the engineer
to build something

860
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,970
of value that had two different journeys,

861
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,373
a structured and an unstructured journey.

862
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,730
The reason why we asked for that

863
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,460
is because the whole
point of generative AI

864
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,930
in the contact center is
so that you can minimize

865
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,510
the differential points that customers

866
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,240
enter your contact center.

867
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,400
And have a single point of
entry that can understand,

868
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,650
guide, and navigate that customer

869
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,050
to the right point of your contact center.

870
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,840
15 years ago, that was a phone number.

871
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,240
So a phone number will
get you to the right area.

872
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,640
So we know when you dial the phone number,

873
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,520
we roughly know why you wanna
get to the contact center.

874
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,430
Then that phone number
went to it a DTMF IVR

875
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,720
to get to a queue,

876
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,040
because then that shrunk
your requirements even more.

877
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,250
So we pinpoint and said okay,
they phoned this phone number,

878
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,100
there's four queues, they're going to Q3.

879
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,850
So these are roughly the agents

880
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,733
that I should send this call
to, or this interaction to.

881
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,950
The point of generative
AI in the contact center

882
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,150
is so that that bot can minimize

883
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,670
the amount of manual filtering

884
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,310
that we are doing in the contact center.

885
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:42,810
And subsequently service
simultaneously for things

886
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:46,020
that we do know should be
helped in the contact center.

887
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,950
So an unstructured fulfillment,
which is the top journey,

888
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,330
is essentially, I don't know why

889
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,380
I'm calling the contact center.

890
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,240
I don't know what my
customer's gonna need,

891
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,250
but I know they need something.

892
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,680
So that bot should be able to understand

893
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,930
a variation of inputs,

894
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,100
and roughly navigate the
customer to the correct journey.

895
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,010
That correct journey could be a queue,

896
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:11,040
it could be another self-service,

897
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,653
or it could be a knowledge article.

898
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,193
So in an unstructured fulfillment,

899
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,310
what we realize is the best way

900
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,070
to build the conversational bot,

901
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:27,060
or the chatbot that
needs to be more dynamic,

902
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,890
is to have the unstructured
journey as a parent bot

903
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,920
that's linked to a large
knowledge article base.

904
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,253
And that large knowledge
article base has to be cleaned,

905
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,950
and different customers have
different levels of clean data.

906
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,170
The important part is garbage
in, garbage out, right?

907
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,910
So you could not expect the bot

908
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,470
to be brilliant at everything.

909
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,410
The cleaner the data, the
more structured the data,

910
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,720
the easier the bot will find it.

911
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,750
We did some tests where
we had very dirty data,

912
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,580
and then we had very clean data.

913
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,870
And there was a 50% higher time to answer,

914
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,750
'cause remember the bot is
computing when you give it input.

915
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,750
And then a 50% to a 60% better,

916
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,990
or more quality response
where it meant something to me

917
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,030
as the asker of the question.

918
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,860
So a big part of our generative AI journey

919
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,290
is that cleaning of data.

920
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,300
So that gives you your
unstructured journey.

921
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,540
So the generative AI bot journey.

922
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,380
Once the generative AI bot
picks up what you need,

923
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,180
and let's assume you need something

924
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,660
that I have a process flow, a map flow,

925
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,660
i.e., your traditional self-service,

926
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,833
I then send you to a child
bot, which is generally Lex,

927
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,240
which you can do today.

928
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,890
And Lex does the API calls
to fulfill your journey,

929
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,590
so that you don't have to put the customer

930
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,110
back into a different
self-service journey.

931
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,060
You just put it into a different bot

932
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,300
using the handing over
from the parent to child.

933
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,890
And it can be multiple child bots

934
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,770
fulfilling multiple API journeys.

935
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,200
The important bit there
that made that successful

936
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,560
is the quality of the APIs,
the speed of the APIs.

937
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,210
And then the last bit is,

938
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,030
how often are people
actually gonna use this?

939
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,940
So what we generally do in this instance

940
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,030
is we do a scope of the customer's estate.

941
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,290
And do a narrative in terms of,

942
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,023
what's the most used journeys?

943
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,720
And generally, that also
comes out of your interviews

944
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,030
with agents, et cetera, to understand,

945
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,013
why are customers calling you?

946
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:36,300
'Cause agents, believe it or not,

947
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,060
would know your contact center
better than execs running it,

948
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,640
because they are underground
talking to the customers.

949
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,100
So you spend a lot of time with the agents

950
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,850
when designing these process flows.

951
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,870
So that's the customer facing one.

952
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,820
Now, what we're working on

953
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,570
is the user facing agentic AI.

954
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,870
So you replace the top half,

955
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,150
which is knowledge repositories,

956
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,070
and you replace that with models

957
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,530
built on contact center data.

958
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,380
So what we're working on
and what our plan for FY '26

959
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,920
for our existing customers is to input

960
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,410
a agentic contact center manager.

961
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,320
But it's not meant to replace
contact center managers,

962
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,230
it's meant to enhance them and
get their job done quicker.

963
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,210
We listened over the last 10 years,

964
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,060
we listened for what the pain points are.

965
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,330
SLAs are the biggest item
in the contact center.

966
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,420
Every contact center
manager that I've ever met,

967
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,380
said every customer only
cares about SLAs, why?

968
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,740
Because that is the single
metric that generally is used

969
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,040
to judge how well a contact
center is performing.

970
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,830
So everyone does a whole
bunch of funny things

971
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,057
to keep their SLAs up.

972
00:52:45,057 --> 00:52:49,170
But what if you had a bot, or a model,

973
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,590
that could preemptively make
decisions to keep that SLA up?

974
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,420
Because there's rules
at the end of the day.

975
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,820
Yes, it's one person that
understands the business

976
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,340
that's making those
rules, and that's selfish

977
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,560
to build your business
around that one person.

978
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,450
So you should rather
build a model around it.

979
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,920
And that's what we're working on now,

980
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,710
is the different variations
of models for contact centers

981
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,590
that take things like operational stats,

982
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,820
survey scores, agents, evaluations,

983
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,300
so that you can do things
like move agents in real-times

984
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,900
before enrouting profiles
to keep your SLAs up.

985
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,820
If a person is calling for the fifth time

986
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,820
into the contact center
for the same thing,

987
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,460
that means that you definitely
need to get that person

988
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,600
to the right agent.

989
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,430
And the right agent is generally the agent

990
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,380
with the lowest handling time,

991
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,710
the highest evaluation scores,

992
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,790
and the highest survey
scores statistically.

993
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,520
So that bot will decide and
put it into that agent queue,

994
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,410
so that agent can help the person

995
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,060
whose calling for the first time.

996
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,260
So in totality, that's
what our plan is for '26,

997
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,750
is to help the users now

998
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,550
manage their contact centers better.

999
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,770
Thank you.

1000
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,610
This is just a screenshot of
a QR code that can be used

1001
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,970
to see one of our use cases,

1002
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,230
but I'll open the floor to questions.

1003
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,680
Sorry there's only about
five minutes, but, yeah.
