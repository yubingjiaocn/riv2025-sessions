1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,350
- Okay, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,520
Welcome to the session.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,550
This is NET 403, Hybrid
Connectivity at Scale,

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,860
a Deep Dive into Direct Connect.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,660
So thank you all for
coming to the session.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,260
I wanted to start out with
a very simple question

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,020
to all of you, which
is what was on my mind

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,820
when I joined AWS a number of years ago,

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,137
when someone said, "Hey, can
you talk to some customers

10
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,597
"about Direct Connect?"

11
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:25,020
And my thought was, "How hard can it be?"

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,330
It's just VLANs, we just
need to know a little bit

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,950
about 802.1Q, bit of
trunking, that sort of thing.

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,770
Little bit of BGP, need
to know about AS numbers,

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,570
that sort of thing, configuring filters

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,180
and prefix lists on routers.

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,040
Of course, the AWS side of things,

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,710
we need to configure
things in the console,

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,510
and of course, the piece of equipment,

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,800
the router on the other end of it.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,843
So how hard could it really be?

22
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,140
Now, something I wanted
to get out of the way.

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,430
My name is Steve Seymour.

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,260
I'm the worldwide tech lead for networking

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,870
and solutions architecture at AWS.

26
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,110
I spoke about Direct Connect back in 2016,

27
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,160
and one of the things that I

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,980
just wanted to remind people of

29
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,180
was, as you can probably
tell from my accent,

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm from the UK, we say roots,

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,310
and I did explain that back then.

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,640
It didn't quite sink in, so
I had to go the next year,

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,580
tried again to explain
what a router really is,

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,260
and this year, I've kind of given up,

35
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,393
so I asked someone else to join me.

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,540
- So I'm Josh Dean, I'm a product manager

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,040
on the Direct Connect team.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,240
I was also born in the
UK, so I was a router guy,

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,693
but now I'm a router
guy, so I'm a convert.

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,840
- So hopefully between us,
we've got people covered,

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,540
whichever one you prefer.

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,350
So another question,
who's used Direct Connect?

43
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,790
Okay, a fair few of you.

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,490
There's one or two that
didn't put their hands up,

45
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,260
but I wanted to maybe give
you a bit of history here,

46
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,540
because at re:Invent back in 2014,

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,510
we actually used Direct
Connect here at the conference.

48
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,190
We used it for a couple of demos,

49
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,300
a couple of launches
that we did that year,

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,870
and if you came to re:Invent
the following year,

51
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,930
and came in 2015, it
was actually being used

52
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,670
to deliver most of the event network.

53
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,810
So if you went to anything on AWS in 2015,

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,820
you would have been using Direct Connect,

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,980
and perhaps unsurprisingly, this year,

56
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,380
Direct Connect is a key part
of the network infrastructure

57
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,240
that we deploy here for re:Invent,

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,960
and it's been that way for
the last couple of years.

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,620
So actually, if you've used
the Wi-Fi here at re:Invent,

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,590
and accessed anything
at all that is on AWS,

61
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,970
you have used Direct Connect.

62
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,133
So perhaps that's
everyone now in the room?

63
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,790
Okay, so let's get started,

64
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,590
and obviously, when I
say how hard can it be,

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,990
there is quite a bit
more to Direct Connect,

66
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,940
and we're gonna walk you
through in this session

67
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,100
everything from physical infrastructure,

68
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,410
so looking at Direct Connect locations,

69
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,720
looking at the different
interfaces that we have,

70
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,490
how to organize cross-connects,

71
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,590
where partners fit into things.

72
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,510
We're gonna look at the
logical infrastructure,

73
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,640
the various types of virtual interfaces,

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,380
and of course, we can't avoid BGP,

75
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,450
it's gonna be part of this session.

76
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,950
And then the other end of this,

77
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,010
the cloud infrastructure, the
AWS side of it, of course.

78
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,873
So that's the plan for this session.

79
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,050
So what is Direct Connect?

80
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,030
Well, it is a physical connection

81
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,837
between your infrastructure
and the AWS infrastructure.

82
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,400
And I say physical connection

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
because it does involve cross-connects,

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,410
connecting pieces of
fiber between equipment

85
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,110
to enable traffic to flow
from your infrastructure

86
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,443
into the AWS backbone
and into our regions.

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,790
Originally, it supported
a couple of connections,

88
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,290
perhaps in a location to
one region, perhaps one VPC,

89
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,360
but Direct Connect has
evolved a lot over the years

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,920
that I've been talking about it.

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,990
So Direct Connect now
supports connectivity

92
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,690
to multiple regions using
Direct Connect gateway,

93
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,330
and of course, multiple VPCs as a result.

94
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,520
And it also supports now
connecting into things

95
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,280
like Cloud WAN, transit
gateways, et cetera.

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,380
So Direct Connect has evolved over time,

97
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,730
as you would expect.

98
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,500
But we're gonna go right
back to the beginning

99
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,010
in terms of establishing
these connections.

100
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,693
So that physical connectivity.

101
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,050
When you're establishing your first

102
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,280
Direct Connect with AWS,

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,410
one of the first
decisions you need to make

104
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,480
is where are you going to do it?

105
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,350
So as I like to say,

106
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,980
it's a location, location,
location discussion.

107
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,960
You need to go look on our website

108
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,860
and look at the different locations

109
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,870
that we have around the
world for Direct Connect.

110
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,680
These are locations where
we have infrastructure

111
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,640
and we can provide ports
for you to connect to.

112
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,680
When you look at that
table on our website,

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,570
we list out the locations,

114
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,060
we list out what is called
the associated region,

115
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,380
and the set of features available

116
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,330
at that particular location.

117
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,150
So if you wanted a particular
amount of bandwidth,

118
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,060
you can look down that
table and recognize,

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,650
hey, this particular location,

120
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,660
it supports the bandwidth that I need.

121
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,130
And we support one gig, 10 gig,
100 gig, and 400 gig ports.

122
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,220
Not all locations have all of
those different bandwidths,

123
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,820
so check the list for which
one makes sense for you.

124
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,410
You're also gonna be
making a decision there

125
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,270
based on where your infrastructure is.

126
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,850
And it might be that you have
your network infrastructure

127
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,410
already in one of those locations,

128
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,990
which makes the choice really quite easy.

129
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,070
If, however, you're connecting

130
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,280
to some on-premises infrastructure
or another data center,

131
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,230
then you'd be choosing the
Direct Connect locations

132
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,840
that are closer physically
to that data center,

133
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,060
because you're gonna have
to order the connectivity

134
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,033
from our Direct Connect
location to your infrastructure.

135
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,200
Now, creating a connection
is really quite simple.

136
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,020
Give it a name, choose the
location from that list.

137
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,430
There is an option at the bottom there

138
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,400
which says you would like
a MACSEC-enabled port.

139
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,890
And I'm gonna talk about that
a little bit more later on,

140
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,760
but that's also listed in that table,

141
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,080
which locations support MACSEC.

142
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,393
So if you plan to use MACSEC,

143
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,320
this is the time you make that decision.

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,210
It's not something you change later on.

145
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,370
If you would like a port
that is capable of MACSEC,

146
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,520
so encryption, choose it when you order

147
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,830
the connection at the beginning.

148
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,840
You're gonna notice
throughout the slides here

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,720
that we have these boxes
down in the bottom corner.

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,400
These are just to call
out some of the quotas

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,470
that we have around Direct Connect.

152
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,620
Many of these you can just
request an increase for.

153
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,070
But in this example, it's 10 connections

154
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,380
per location per region.

155
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,860
That's your starting point

156
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,903
for ordering Direct Connect connections.

157
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,870
Okay, so we've ordered our connection.

158
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,640
We've clicked through on the console.

159
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,260
Well, the next step, surely,

160
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,000
we just need to get ourselves connected.

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,623
We just plug in, don't we?

162
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,750
Well, the photo that I'm showing you here,

163
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,820
this is an example of a meet-me room.

164
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,070
So this is Equinix TY2.

165
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,230
And as you can see, it's
full of a lot of fiber,

166
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,790
a lot of ports.

167
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,570
This is actually a very,
very tidy, neat meet-me room.

168
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,480
And this is where your port from AWS

169
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,910
is presented for you to consume.

170
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,560
So when you order that connection,

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,620
we then issue something called an LOA CFA.

172
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,720
So an LOA is a letter of authorization.

173
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,620
It is your permission to
plug into a particular port.

174
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,290
And CFA is the Connecting
Facility Assignment.

175
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,870
It's basically where is that port.

176
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,910
So this document contains
everything you need

177
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,140
to be able to plug into that

178
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,740
Direct Connect port on our side.

179
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,610
It's gonna contain other information,

180
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,320
such as the connector type.

181
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,590
So LC connector is
typically what we would see.

182
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,150
It's a single-mode connection.

183
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,620
The different standards that are required

184
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,260
for the different
bandwidths for our ports.

185
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,270
So you've got all that information.

186
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,020
So surely now, you just plug in, yeah?

187
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,790
No, that's not quite how it goes.

188
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,360
Because in reality, you
personally, as a customer,

189
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,910
probably do not have access
to that meet-me room.

190
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,470
So in reality, you're gonna have to work

191
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,040
with the co-location provider now

192
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,360
to arrange for something
called a cross-connect

193
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,190
between that port that we've allocated

194
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,483
and your infrastructure.

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,110
So when we think about getting connected,

196
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,410
unfortunately, there have to
be multiple people involved

197
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,090
in making this connection.

198
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,210
It's not something that you
can own totally yourself.

199
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,060
There's always gonna be at
least three parties involved.

200
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,950
There's obviously AWS on one side,

201
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,690
providing the Direct Connect port.

202
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,240
There's your side of
things, your infrastructure.

203
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,360
And in the middle, we've got
this co-location provider

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,710
that needs to make the cross-connect.

205
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,750
The reality also is,
though, if you're connecting

206
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,370
to a facility that is outside

207
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,800
of that particular co-location facility,

208
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,360
then you're probably gonna have to work

209
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,970
with some sort of telco partner, carrier,

210
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,850
maybe even a separate last-mile provider.

211
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,980
And unfortunately, all
of the people involved

212
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,260
probably have their own processes,

213
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,270
their own ways of doing testing.

214
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,800
And I'll come onto this later on,

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,290
perhaps their own polarity on their ports

216
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,300
causes some interesting challenges.

217
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,820
So I've been doing this
for quite a few years.

218
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,950
I've worked on a bunch
of customer projects

219
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,230
and internal projects
involving Direct Connect,

220
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,630
and I thought I'd just
share a couple of tips

221
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,700
from my experiences.

222
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,530
And the first one is, I would say,

223
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,290
always draw out a really simple diagram

224
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,080
of what you're trying to
achieve with Direct Connect.

225
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Put AWS on one side, put your
infrastructure on the other,

226
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,410
and then work out all of the
pieces involved in the middle.

227
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,780
Doesn't have to be fancy,
just a very simple diagram

228
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,130
that shows all the locations,

229
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,140
perhaps all the devices
that you're aware of

230
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,570
that these connections
are gonna go through.

231
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,750
On that diagram, identify
who owns each component,

232
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,910
because they will all
have different owners.

233
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,820
And then every port ID,
every circuit number,

234
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,410
everything you see written in an email

235
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,360
or said to you over the phone,

236
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,800
just add it onto that diagram.

237
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,240
And this will become your reference

238
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,420
for everything to do with that
particular Direct Connect.

239
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,280
I also find it quite useful
just to note on there

240
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
things like support details,

241
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,580
contact details for the people involved,

242
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,600
because this, as I say,

243
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,560
just becomes your
reference going forwards.

244
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,600
So how do we put all the
pieces together here?

245
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,970
So what I wanted to start
with was the example

246
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,550
where you've got infrastructure
in your own facility,

247
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,080
perhaps your own data center.

248
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,970
It's not within the
Direct Connect location,

249
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,600
so in my example earlier,
the Equinix TY2 facility.

250
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
And we want to establish this connection

251
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,890
from an AWS Direct Connect port

252
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,590
all the way through to your equipment.

253
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,990
Now it'd be really nice if you
could just fire off an email

254
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,087
that says, "Hey, partner, could
you just make this happen?

255
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,087
"Here's the LOA from
AWS, here's my equipment.

256
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:01,260
"Could you just connect the two together?"

257
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm not gonna lie, there are some cases

258
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,200
where you can do that.

259
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,450
There are some excellent partners

260
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,930
who have all of the ability
to deliver this end-to-end.

261
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,580
But unfortunately, the reality is

262
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,880
there are usually many
more components involved.

263
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,650
But let's stick with
the example for a moment

264
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,380
where we've asked a partner to deliver it,

265
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,360
and in which case, they simply build

266
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,260
all these connections.

267
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,390
So perhaps they arrange the last mile

268
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,300
from your data center
to a point of presence

269
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,030
in your city for their infrastructure.

270
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,340
Maybe then they configure
across the backbone

271
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,670
that they have over their
optical network into a location,

272
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,500
and they arrange it all, fantastic.

273
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,283
They plug it in, ports come
up on your router, happy days.

274
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,150
As I say, the reality is
a little bit different.

275
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,580
Now, the infrastructure I mentioned there

276
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,860
is in place typically, so there will be

277
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,540
points of presence in your city.

278
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,800
There will be infrastructure in

279
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,210
these co-location facilities

280
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,910
from the various telcos and carriers.

281
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,790
Also, there is the meet-me
room infrastructure

282
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,920
that I mentioned a moment ago.

283
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,470
AWS's equipment is already pre-cabled

284
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,230
from our devices directly
into that meet-me room,

285
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,450
into what you saw in the photo earlier on.

286
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,790
And the chances are
that the large carriers

287
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,120
and telcos in these facilities

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,530
are also pre-cabled to the meet-me room.

289
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,690
So what that means is we
still have a few gaps,

290
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,570
but it's not quite as bad
as I showed a moment ago.

291
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,030
But to make all these connections happen,

292
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,530
you can imagine there's gonna be

293
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,480
a lot of communication going on.

294
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,240
There's gonna be the
request from the owner

295
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,610
of the telecoms equipment to request

296
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,440
the cross-connect in the first place.

297
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,150
There's gonna be provisioning of ports

298
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,340
and circuits across the infrastructure.

299
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,780
There's probably gonna be some ordering

300
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,940
of running fiber across a town.

301
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,520
There might even be
involvement of logistics

302
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,470
to dig up the road to run fiber.

303
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,940
All sorts of things could be involved.

304
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,250
But when it comes down to it,

305
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,320
if you break down that simple diagram

306
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,510
and do it in stages, the first piece

307
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,550
is that cross-connect in the meet-me room.

308
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,060
So in this case, the telco has had to ask

309
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,610
Equinix in our example to
make that cross-connect.

310
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,160
The telco has then had to
make physical connections

311
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,830
between patch panels in their
rack and their equipment,

312
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,080
configure circuits over their network,

313
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,210
deliver it to your local city,

314
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,460
perhaps dig up some streets,

315
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,110
and then deliver it into your location

316
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,560
presented on a port ready
to go into your router.

317
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,020
And at that point, we
might have a connection.

318
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,120
The other variation on
this is if you are located

319
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,790
inside that co-location facility already.

320
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,950
Now if you're in there, things
are clearly a lot simpler.

321
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,740
You don't have any of that
external telecoms work to do.

322
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,350
So you'll have your rack, your equipment.

323
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,470
Chances are you're also
pre-cabled to the meet-me room.

324
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,030
If you're not familiar
with that experience,

325
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,530
typically the first time you order

326
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,020
any sort of cross-connect
in many of these facilities,

327
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,700
they will install a whole set of fiber

328
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,890
between your rack and the meet-me room.

329
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,770
And what that means is you
can now interact directly

330
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,420
with that location provider.

331
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,640
So it really is as simple
as then sending the email

332
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,040
that says, "Please can you
make this cross-connect?"

333
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,300
And of course, it might not be an email.

334
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,920
Different providers use portals.

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,630
You might upload the details,

336
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,030
provide the document we
give you as evidence.

337
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,880
But effectively, you just
order that cross-connect

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,713
and it's done.

339
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,360
I've said cross-connect a couple of times.

340
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,620
A cross-connect really
is just a piece of fiber

341
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,620
being plugged into one port on one side

342
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,300
and another port on the other.

343
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
There's nothing more to it.

344
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,840
I regularly get asked, "What
is this cross-connect thing?"

345
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,130
And it's very simple.

346
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,483
It's just a piece of fiber.

347
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,160
So at that point, our connection comes up

348
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,400
and hopefully the thing
you see in the AWS console

349
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,500
is that your port goes from being down

350
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,150
to now showing as available.

351
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,490
The link comes up on your router.

352
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,140
We're in a good place.

353
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,370
But let's just go and verify

354
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,500
that everything is as we expect.

355
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,260
So we have CloudWatch
monitoring for Direct Connect.

356
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,733
There's a whole bunch of the metrics

357
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,290
that you would expect to see there,

358
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,940
bandwidth usage, et cetera.

359
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,290
But I wanted to just draw your attention

360
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,760
to the connection state,

361
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,650
which is a very simple
metric you can look at

362
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,830
that indicates, is the
connection up or down?

363
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,150
If it's one, it's up.

364
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,100
Anything else, it's down.

365
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,440
The other interesting ones to look at here

366
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,170
are the light levels, particularly the RX,

367
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,910
so the receive light level.

368
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,080
And you can see on there,

369
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,550
I've made a note of the ranges
that are considered good.

370
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,330
Effectively, if you
get down to neg 12 DBM,

371
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,820
you're okay, but you could be better.

372
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,230
Start getting beyond that,

373
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,390
this connection probably isn't coming up.

374
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,363
And the reason I'm mentioning this

375
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,600
is you can have a situation where

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
everything is plugged in and connected,

377
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,050
but you haven't got a link yet.

378
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,760
And it's good to come and
have a look in the console

379
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,740
and actually see what the light level is

380
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,260
because it may well all be
connected absolutely fine,

381
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,180
but you might have some
dirty fiber somewhere

382
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,710
that wasn't cleaned when it was connected

383
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,920
or something like that
that's attenuating the light

384
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,680
that means we've not got
enough signal getting through.

385
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,323
So always go take a look
at the CloudWatch metrics.

386
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,010
Everything I've been talking about so far

387
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,800
is what we refer to as
a dedicated connection.

388
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,180
And it's exactly what it sounds like.

389
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,820
This is a dedicated port
on a piece of AWS equipment

390
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,260
that is assigned to you.

391
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,260
You requested it and
we allocated it to you.

392
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,180
You get full use of that port

393
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,300
and the bandwidth available on it.

394
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,920
It will support multiple
virtual interfaces,

395
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,320
which we're gonna explain a
little bit more in a moment,

396
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,260
but that's effectively
multiple VLANs and BGP sessions

397
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,900
because you're in control of
everything about that port.

398
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,840
Fundamentally, it is physical connectivity

399
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,000
that you're responsible
for to get to the port

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
that we've allocated to you.

401
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,860
Hosted connections are
a little bit different.

402
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,290
What happens here is
we allocate connections

403
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,330
to one of our Direct Connect partners,

404
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,160
and we actually call them
interconnects at that point.

405
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,050
You may see that term around.

406
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,540
And our partners have
already then taken care

407
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,400
of all that physical connectivity

408
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,130
between their infrastructure and ours.

409
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,890
What they then do is allocate
smaller amounts of bandwidth

410
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,650
on that connectivity to
you and provide it to you

411
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,080
perhaps over an existing fabric or service

412
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,483
they might have with you as a customer.

413
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,800
In that case, our partners can
increase their connectivity

414
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,110
with us by combining connections together.

415
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,150
They can create lags just like you can,

416
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,220
and we'll explain that in a moment.

417
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,900
But they can increase that capacity,

418
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,180
but we don't let partners
oversubscribe those ports.

419
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,580
So as they allocate bandwidth to you,

420
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,260
that bandwidth is passed on to you,

421
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,240
and they have to expand their connectivity

422
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,760
with us over time.

423
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,620
The thing about hosted connection is

424
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,820
you can only have one virtual interface

425
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,470
per hosted connection.

426
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,000
So it's quite common for our customers

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,860
to have multiple hosted connections

428
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,930
if they need them for different workloads,

429
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,450
perhaps some for virtual private gateways

430
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,500
and some for transit gateways, et cetera.

431
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,870
I mentioned their lags,
link aggregation groups.

432
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,700
So what a link aggregation group is,

433
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,660
is it allows you to combine
multiple physical connections

434
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,210
into one single thing that is treated

435
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,160
as a dedicated connection.

436
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,550
So you might combine together
four 10 gig connections.

437
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,220
So you have a resulting
40 gig of capacity there,

438
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,930
but you treat it as a single connection

439
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,880
when you're configuring
virtual interfaces,

440
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,260
et cetera, on it.

441
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,940
We'll then do flow hashing of the traffic

442
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,500
across those connections,

443
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,190
and you can configure on the
AWS side and your equipment,

444
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,063
what is the appropriate point

445
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:09,420
that you would rather shut
down that set of connections

446
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,120
if you lose capacity
versus maintaining it.

447
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,520
So you might have 40 gig of connectivity

448
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,260
and you decide that you really need

449
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,960
to always have 20 gig available.

450
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,390
So if one of those other
connections is impacted,

451
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,660
you're down to 30 gig,
that's fine, keep the lag up.

452
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,030
But if we drop down to 20 gig or below,

453
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,410
perhaps we then shut it down.

454
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,240
And that's configured
as the minimum number

455
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,743
of interfaces on a lag.

456
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,090
So we're in a fairly
good place at this point.

457
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,810
We've assumed everything's
working, but what if it doesn't?

458
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,430
And what I thought I'd do is just talk you

459
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,840
through a couple of situations

460
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,280
that we hear about all the time,

461
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,100
and our support engineers end
up discussing with customers.

462
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,260
So I wanted to just give you
maybe a bit of an insight

463
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,633
into two things that
we hear very regularly.

464
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,960
And that other phrase
is, "Roll the fiber,"

465
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,087
or "I'm gonna put a loop on that."

466
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,640
I see a few people nodding here.

467
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,680
Maybe you've heard that or experienced it.

468
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,910
For those of you that have not worked

469
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,490
with physical fiber equipment,

470
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,720
at the bottom there we've
got what's called an SFP,

471
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
a small form factor pluggable module.

472
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,420
And on the right-hand side
we have some duplex fiber

473
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,550
with LC connectors on the end of it.

474
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,400
And the module at the
bottom is what is sitting

475
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
in those various pieces
of network equipment

476
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,090
on each end of this connection.

477
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,930
And you might be able to see

478
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,160
in very small writing on there,

479
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,140
it's marked TX and RX.

480
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,510
So that's transmit and receive.

481
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,640
So what happens there on the transmit side

482
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,400
is there is a laser inside that module

483
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,040
that is firing the light out of it.

484
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,160
And when it gets to the other end,

485
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,630
it needs to go into the receive side

486
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,460
of the other connection.

487
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,190
So just to illustrate
that point a little bit,

488
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,470
this would be just two
devices next to each other

489
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,510
with a single duplex fiber cable

490
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,040
that you would just plug in.

491
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,940
This is what would happen.

492
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,390
Transmit would be connected
to receive and vice versa.

493
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,290
We'd all be having a good day.

494
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,540
Packets would be flowing, no problem.

495
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,030
But when you put this
in the context of a code

496
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,610
or location facility, we've
now introduced a meet-me room.

497
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,860
Now, there are no actual standards

498
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,200
for how to do this kind of cabling.

499
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,360
There's some, I guess, best practices

500
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,650
that have been adopted in terms

501
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,870
of where you cross over those pairs.

502
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,960
So typically between your
rack and the meet-me room,

503
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,910
the fiber will have been crossed over.

504
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,730
And if we take that simple
example on the screen there,

505
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,410
you've got two sides of a connection here,

506
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,580
a single meet-me room.

507
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,350
The fibers have been crossed on one side,

508
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,640
crossed on the other.

509
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,890
The patch in the middle
is just a simple fiber

510
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,660
between those ports.

511
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,010
That unravels quite nicely,

512
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,660
and you end up with transmit to receive

513
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,680
and vice versa again.

514
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,513
All good.

515
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,560
The other variation, though,

516
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,110
is when you start adding
in multiple meet-me rooms,

517
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,020
other providers, other
pieces of equipment,

518
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,940
and before you know it,
you've got a situation

519
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,670
where these fibers have
been crossed multiple times.

520
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,700
So when you hear the
phrase roll the fiber,

521
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,350
what they literally mean is swap,

522
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,823
transmit, and receive around.

523
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,240
I've lost track of the number
of times I've visited racks

524
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,380
where I've seen the little clips

525
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,390
on an LC fiber connector broken off

526
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,370
so that the fibers can be swapped around.

527
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,440
It's a very, very common thing.

528
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,390
I wish it was totally
standardized everywhere,

529
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,500
but unfortunately it's not.

530
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,570
So that's what that means if you hear that

531
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,020
when you're debugging a connection.

532
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,000
The other phrase is putting a loop on it.

533
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,890
So what I'm showing you here, very simply,

534
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,540
again, these are just two SFPs,

535
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,540
two devices that are
connected via a meet-me room,

536
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,610
and perhaps the connection
isn't coming up.

537
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,050
And what we wanna do here is identify

538
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,280
where's the potential problem.

539
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,690
Do we have some broken fiber?

540
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,160
What's the issue?

541
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,320
So what will happen here
is you'll hear someone say,

542
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,820
I'm gonna put a loop on that connection

543
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,663
facing towards AWS or
facing towards this carrier.

544
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,210
What that means is in that meet-me room,

545
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,860
they might unplug that fiber,

546
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,600
that cross-connect that we had,

547
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
and quite simply, they will
just loop the two together

548
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,620
on one side.

549
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,040
So on the AWS side, our
laser is firing light out.

550
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,720
It gets to that port in the meet-me room.

551
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,810
It gets turned right back
around, sent back to AWS.

552
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,520
And now, in those CloudWatch metrics,

553
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,430
you would see light level being received.

554
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,720
It's not always true that the connection

555
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
would come up as such,

556
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,990
but you can see that
that loop has been made.

557
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,730
And even better, you
could see the transition

558
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,760
where there was no loop
at all, no light flowing.

559
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,660
You loop it, it's good.

560
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,300
So now you know the path from AWS

561
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,220
to the meet-me room is good.

562
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,200
The same could be done on the
other side with the carrier,

563
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
and it could be done at various places

564
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,260
all the way down the path

565
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,050
to troubleshoot a problem like this.

566
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,920
So they're the two phrases
you're likely to hear.

567
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,220
I thought I would share it with you,

568
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,230
because as I say, our support organization

569
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,840
work with customers
regularly on these things.

570
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,790
And quite often, we find customers

571
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,270
don't necessarily understand
these concepts, which I get.

572
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,463
So hopefully, this clarifies that process.

573
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,550
The last thing I wanted to talk about

574
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,250
in terms of physical
connectivity is MACSEC.

575
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,010
So MACSEC is enabled at the port level,

576
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,150
as I mentioned earlier.

577
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,320
When you request your port,

578
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
you check that box at the bottom,

579
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,940
and if it's available for that
bandwidth at that location,

580
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,370
it's now available for you to consume.

581
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,600
MACSEC encrypts the traffic
between two Layer 2 devices.

582
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,370
So if you've got a piece of equipment

583
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,750
in that co-location facility,

584
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,240
and you connect them together
via the cross-connects,

585
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,350
no problem.

586
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,300
If you're connecting outside that facility

587
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,890
to perhaps your data center,

588
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,300
as long as your carrier is passing

589
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,130
through all the Layer 2 traffic,

590
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,900
then you can establish a MACSEC connection

591
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,200
between those two devices.

592
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,700
Once that traffic gets into AWS,

593
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,110
we encrypt all of the traffic

594
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,330
between AWS-secured facilities.

595
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,460
So that MACSEC session
is between your device

596
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,013
and the Direct Connect
device in that location.

597
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,110
The keys for this session
are generated by you.

598
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,860
They're stored inside KMS,
sorry, in Secrets Manager,

599
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,700
and you can then rotate these
if you need to over time.

600
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,920
You have a choice when you
configure MACSEC as well

601
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,200
in terms of what you want
to do with the encryption.

602
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,850
So you can choose no encryption,

603
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,530
maybe that's your starting point.

604
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,730
If this was part of a plan

605
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,650
that you were gonna
enable MACSEC later on,

606
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,020
you'd set it to no encrypt.

607
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,820
There's also then should encrypt,

608
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,370
where the two devices
will try and establish

609
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,780
an encrypted connection between them,

610
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,240
your device to ours, but if it fails,

611
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,920
the connection will still come up.

612
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,690
So that's quite a common stage to go to

613
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,000
as you're rolling out MACSEC connectivity.

614
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,100
You enable it, you set
it to should connect.

615
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,780
That now effectively lets you test it

616
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,640
because if you get it right,

617
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,260
the connection will come up
and you'll see it encrypted.

618
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,140
If it doesn't work, you haven't
interrupted the connection.

619
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,910
And then the final one is must encrypt,

620
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,500
which is exactly what it sounds like.

621
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,360
If we can't establish the encryption

622
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,280
between the two devices

623
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,880
the connection will stay down

624
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
and all your virtual interfaces
will be down as well.

625
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,440
So talking of virtual interfaces,

626
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,193
I'm gonna hand over to Josh
to talk about those with you.

627
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,713
- All right, thank you, Steve.

628
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,610
Yeah, so just taking a look at
the virtual interfaces here,

629
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,710
just really quick, just to level set,

630
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,560
Steve kind of alluded to
it, but virtual interface,

631
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,260
that's the VLAN and the BGP, right?

632
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,920
I know you kind of like talk
down about BGP, but I like it.

633
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,530
So we have three main types

634
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,150
and I'm gonna go into
some details on them.

635
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,830
So don't panic.

636
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,660
Public, private and transit.

637
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,220
So public is for connecting
to public AWS endpoints,

638
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,810
S3, that sort of thing.

639
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,030
Private for getting to VPCs.

640
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,160
Transit for getting to transit
gateways and cloud ones

641
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
and then to VPCs.

642
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
And then we also have the concept

643
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,980
of a hosted virtual interface,

644
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,560
not to be confused with
the hosted connection.

645
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,920
This is a virtual interface owned

646
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,500
by another account's connection.

647
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,290
They configure all the
BGP and all of that stuff

648
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,380
and then you attach it
to your VPC, essentially.

649
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,270
So sometimes that's like
an infrastructure account

650
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,103
or something like that.

651
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,180
(inhales)

652
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,220
So we'll start with
public virtual interfaces.

653
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,820
I'm not gonna go into
super detail on these

654
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,290
'cause I'm kind of hoping you know

655
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,140
at least some level of
understanding about these,

656
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,880
but public virtual interface,

657
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,733
these are, as I said,
connects you to any region.

658
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,780
These are, you use public IPs for peering.

659
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,110
We have some ability to scope these down.

660
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,520
I'll explain that a little later on.

661
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,830
But essentially what it is is
your own personal connection

662
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,130
to the public side of AWS.

663
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,120
To talk about private virtual interfaces,

664
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,640
we have to kind of go back in time first.

665
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,160
We have to go before 2017,

666
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,060
which feels like the way back machine.

667
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,570
Back then, Direct Connect was
kind of a regional service.

668
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,190
So what you had was your
Direct Connect was in a region

669
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,660
and you could connect to your VPCs

670
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,910
that were in that region.

671
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,790
So in my example here, I have US East 1

672
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,130
and I have my VPC in US East 1

673
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,473
and my connection is in US East 1.

674
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,620
I can still connect to multiple VPCs,

675
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,800
but one VPC per virtual interface.

676
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,840
And this is where that concept

677
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,460
of an associated region comes in,

678
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,480
which you may have seen if you've

679
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,190
used Direct Connect at all

680
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,990
because you can still
use this architecture.

681
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,990
Then we kind of moved on a little bit

682
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,800
to this architecture using
Direct Connect Gateway.

683
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,660
So these are still private
virtual interfaces,

684
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,110
but what these do, what
Direct Connect Gateway does

685
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,600
is allows you to bring all
your private virtual interfaces

686
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,630
into one Direct Connect Gateway.

687
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,140
Those can be global from anywhere

688
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,940
and you can then attach
your VPCs anywhere as well.

689
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,910
So you can go kind of
from anywhere to anywhere.

690
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,693
I mean, from on-prem
to VPC, VPC to on-prem.

691
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,430
Then we started to get into the sort of

692
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,893
the transit gateway Cloud WAN world.

693
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,760
You've probably come
across those services.

694
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,740
So we introduced transit
virtual interfaces,

695
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,070
those very similar, similar idea.

696
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,780
You connect to regionally,

697
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,910
you can connect to transit gateways,

698
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,730
Cloud WANs in different
regions, add those on.

699
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,340
One thing to note there,

700
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,140
you cannot mix and match there.

701
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,560
You can't add VGWs and TGWs

702
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,390
and you can't add transit
VIFs and private VIFs

703
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,010
to the same ones.

704
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,860
Just something to keep in mind there.

705
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,910
And then just one other thing
I wanted to point out here,

706
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,453
not necessarily a VIF type,
but kind of a setting on a VIF,

707
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,300
private or transit VIF at least,

708
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,980
is something called site link.

709
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,360
This allows you to take your
traffic from one DX location

710
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,230
to another DX location,
ride the AWS backbone.

711
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,600
The nice thing is, and
you can see I created

712
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,190
a lovely little GIF.

713
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,930
You can just click the button

714
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,250
and you'll start seeing the route show

715
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,083
up on the other side.

716
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,790
So you can kind of use
it as needed, right?

717
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,883
You don't even have to
keep it on all the time.

718
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,310
So taking a quick look at monitoring,

719
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,570
these are sort of building on the things

720
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,800
that Steve talked about before,

721
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,190
but for virtual interfaces,

722
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,570
we also have the bits per
second, ingress, egress,

723
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,950
and packets per second,
so just give you the idea

724
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,830
of what traffic is going
over those connections.

725
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,810
And then we also have an
offering under CloudWatch

726
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,810
called CloudWatch Network
Synthetic Monitor.

727
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,490
That's actually sending real traffic.

728
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,570
So you configure an
endpoint in your subnets

729
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,720
and you configure, you
give us an endpoint on-prem

730
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,693
and we send ICMP or TCP
traffic, you choose,

731
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,140
and we return roundtrip time and

732
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,640
packet loss metrics to you.

733
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,160
There's also a network
health indicator metric

734
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,300
that comes back.

735
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,230
What that is,

736
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,390
it's us looking at all
of our internal metrics

737
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,940
for everything from the subnet all the way

738
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,700
to the direct connect endpoint
that you're connected to,

739
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,320
just to give you kind of a quick look

740
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,840
if you're having a network issue to say,

741
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,850
oh, that's definitely an AWS problem,

742
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,320
I can go yell at them,

743
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,873
or I need to go investigate my network.

744
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,750
And so to troubleshooting
virtual interfaces,

745
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,750
so again, layer one, you should be fine

746
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,690
'cause you've been through
Steve's presentation,

747
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,730
but again, that's kind of the first thing.

748
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,870
If your layer one's not up,

749
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,870
you're not gonna get any further, right?

750
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,510
The next thing to check if
your VIF's not coming up

751
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,780
is layer two, so making
sure your VLAN tags

752
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,550
match on both sides.

753
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,680
The other thing we see pretty commonly,

754
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,610
especially when you start adding
in partners and providers,

755
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,010
they love to use these
encapsulation technologies.

756
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,470
Again, totally fine, no problem,

757
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,560
but we need to make sure
once they are facing,

758
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,750
like the port facing AWS,
those are stripped off

759
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,200
and it's just the VLAN of
your virtual interface.

760
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,250
Then once you get up another layer,

761
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,090
you're into sort of BGP layer
three sort of issues, right?

762
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,090
So you can kind of see it
goes two different ways.

763
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,480
If you're seeing in your BGP logs,

764
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,020
stuff getting stuck in
idle, connect active,

765
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,900
it's probably a network
connectivity problem.

766
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,370
If you're getting over that,

767
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,713
you're getting into
open sent, open confirm,

768
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,893
it's a BGP parameter
problem more than likely.

769
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,840
Okay, so I wanna talk a
little bit about routing

770
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,963
because there's a lot to it.

771
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,530
First thing I wanted to bring up here,

772
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,690
just kind of as I'm thinking about it,

773
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,890
as I was thinking about this,

774
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,220
there are the limits and some limits

775
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,270
are more important than others

776
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,670
and they kind of come
in at different places.

777
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,260
So on the screen,

778
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,540
I've got virtual interfaces per connection

779
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,630
and transit virtual
interfaces per connection.

780
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,560
Those are super important,

781
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,270
but those only really matter

782
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,583
when you're architecting
your network, right?

783
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,930
The next two routes per peer,

784
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,550
those can take down your network

785
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,810
or take down your direct connect

786
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,480
if you exceed them at any point.

787
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,130
So you really wanna kind of make sure

788
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,257
you have a good
understanding of your routes

789
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:54,330
and are summarizing and making sure

790
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,730
you're kind of keeping
those under control.

791
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,823
So I'll give you some ideas
on how you can do that.

792
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,150
First of all, here's an example
of like a route filtering.

793
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,420
So here I'm filtering
just for a couple of /24s,

794
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,420
applying those as a route map to my peer,

795
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,283
sending just those routes to AWS.

796
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,900
Another option here is
using summarization.

797
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,210
So I'm using this
aggregate address command.

798
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,580
So basically what it's
saying is I've got those 24s,

799
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,273
ignore those, send a
/16, only the summary.

800
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,790
And then at the bottom,

801
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,120
I'm injecting a default route
using default originate.

802
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,540
The idea there being just
send a default route to AWS

803
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,450
and then use the VPC route
tables, TGW route tables,

804
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,620
that sort of thing to control

805
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,723
exactly which traffic you're sending.

806
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,180
Okay, how do you configure the routing?

807
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,030
Active, passive, passive,
no, active, active,

808
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,863
that sort of thing, right?

809
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:59,520
That's kind of the next step.

810
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,130
This is the mnemonic
device I was always taught.

811
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,370
So I hope some of you have used that too.

812
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,200
Still don't understand
why there's two oranges.

813
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
I find that super confusing,

814
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,190
but I've never used origin or origin type

815
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,413
to decide a route, so it's fine.

816
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,210
Okay, so here's an example.

817
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,070
I've got an Ashburn, Virginia,

818
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,840
direct connect to New York direct connect.

819
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,760
My VPC is in US East 1, my
data center's in Virginia.

820
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,560
I wanna prefer the Ashburn direct connect.

821
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,460
So how can I do that?

822
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,890
Well, one way is AS
path per pending, right?

823
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,050
That's pretty common in the industry,

824
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,100
very common way to do it.

825
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,130
The other way that we could do it with AWS

826
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,443
is using local preference communities.

827
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,710
So we have this set of communities

828
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,390
that allow you to influence AWS's

829
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,070
local preference, essentially.

830
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,400
Then obviously you wanna also
apply the same metric locally

831
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,140
onto the routes you're receiving from us

832
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,040
just to kind of keep things symmetric.

833
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,020
And just so you can kind of see

834
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,180
what those routes would look like,

835
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,730
the top two routes are
the preferred routes,

836
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,350
the shorter AS path,

837
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,113
and the higher local preference community.

838
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,450
All right, what if you
bought all this bandwidth

839
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,010
and you wanna use it all?

840
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,970
Why not?

841
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,230
You wanna go active active.

842
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,130
I've got two connections now
in that same data center.

843
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,200
How can I utilize everything?

844
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
Well, I could just use

845
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,000
the same local preference
communities on both.

846
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,760
Technically could also
use the same AS path.

847
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,220
I personally like to use the
local preference communities

848
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,480
because I feel like it,

849
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,920
since it's higher up the list
of like the decision tree,

850
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,010
it makes me feel a
little more comfortable.

851
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,440
But you could also do this
with AS path per pending.

852
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,680
But local preference is my choice.

853
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,080
But this way we'll ECMP
traffic across both.

854
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,410
So obviously advise you would
do the same on your side,

855
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,150
but that way we're splitting traffic

856
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,503
across both connections.

857
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,680
So for resiliency purposes,

858
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,290
maybe now I'm going back
to my two data center

859
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,820
or I'm adding a second data center.

860
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,713
Now I have a data center in New York,

861
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,640
but my data center is still in Virginia.

862
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,820
I probably don't wanna
ECMP across everything

863
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,430
because I'm gonna have
some weird latency problems

864
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,470
and things are gonna start
arriving out of order

865
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,060
and that sort of thing, right?

866
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,350
So in that case, generally,

867
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,330
I'm gonna apply my local
preference communities

868
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,700
on the closest.

869
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,410
So that would be, well, I would pick one,

870
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,050
but I would pick my aspirin
since that's the closest

871
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,880
and then kind of a lower priority

872
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,160
on the New York data center.

873
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,750
Then obviously if things fail,

874
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,150
we can ECMP on the other
one, everything's fine.

875
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,490
Now, I've never really
come across a network

876
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,143
that's that super clean.

877
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,500
They're usually a little
messier than that.

878
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,820
And obviously we only have three

879
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,470
local preference communities.

880
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,740
So what do you do if you
have four routes or more

881
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,420
or four different paths

882
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,123
and you wanna go one,
two, three, four in order?

883
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,180
Well, for that sort of use case,

884
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,220
what I would do, what I recommend,

885
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,240
just equal out the local
preferences everywhere

886
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,640
and then use AS-Passive.

887
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,260
So you can kind of get,
you can get super granular.

888
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,380
You could go more than
four obviously with this.

889
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,243
But that's how I would handle it.

890
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,570
Okay, just on public VIFs for a minute.

891
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,850
I kind of mentioned
these a little bit ago.

892
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,340
The scoping communities that we have,

893
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,030
these allow you to filter
the routes from AWS

894
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,920
that you receive, the public routes,

895
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,720
and only accept routes for
either the local region,

896
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,050
the local continent, or
accept everything globally.

897
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,000
Likewise, you can tell AWS,

898
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,420
I only want you to advertise my route

899
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,780
into the local region,
the local continent,

900
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,080
or you can do it globally.

901
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,630
The other thing to note,

902
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,990
if you advertise the
same route with an ISP

903
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,340
and over Direct Connect,

904
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,530
we're gonna prefer Direct Connect

905
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,790
unless you advertise
something more specific

906
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,940
or something like that.

907
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,190
We don't apply local
preference communities here.

908
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,450
Those don't apply.

909
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,670
You can use the AS-Path for Pending

910
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,010
as long as you are using a public ASN.

911
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,660
So if you use a private ASN,

912
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,920
you're just gonna strip it off

913
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,230
and use a public one internally.

914
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,770
And then ECMP, it gets
a little bit sketchier

915
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,510
with public VIFs to be honest.

916
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,930
And I would generally just
say within the same location,

917
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,680
you can do ECMP as long as
everything else is the same.

918
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,330
And so just a couple things.

919
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,260
To take a look at,

920
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,260
these are what the routes
look like coming from AWS.

921
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,410
First of all, you'll notice
that we apply an ASN.

922
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,773
We do a bit of prepending
and we apply the no export.

923
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,000
That's really just to protect us from,

924
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,790
if you were to leak the routes
out to an ISP or something,

925
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,040
obviously your ISP should stop you.

926
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,300
But just in case they didn't,

927
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,150
we've got a little bit of protection.

928
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,220
I've seen customers
strip off the no export,

929
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,170
advertise them internally,
that sort of thing.

930
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,520
That's totally fine.

931
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,313
It's just kind of a little
accidental protection.

932
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,550
And then you'll see at the
bottom there, the 8100,

933
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,890
that's just saying that
this route originated

934
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,360
from that region,

935
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,513
from the region that my
direct connect is in.

936
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,593
Okay.

937
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,820
So, a bit of failover testing, right?

938
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,910
Super important, once
you get your setup going,

939
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,970
you're gonna have maintenance,
things are gonna happen.

940
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,220
Somewhere along that big,
long, complicated chain

941
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,910
of partners and providers,
something's gonna go down.

942
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,490
So, you wanna know that you're good.

943
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,290
So, you can do that any number of ways.

944
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,260
We do have a little failover testing tool,

945
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,970
which lets you bring down BGP.

946
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,020
You can set a time for
that, up to 72 hours,

947
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,190
which seems like a lot,

948
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,460
but you could set it to
be down for 72 hours.

949
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,610
If it all goes wrong,
thankfully you can cancel it.

950
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,443
That's good.

951
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,920
And then just a note on our SLA as well,

952
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,000
that we have for direct connect.

953
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,940
So, we have three models for our SLA.

954
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,580
First one is a single
connection deployment,

955
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,690
pretty much is what it says.

956
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,890
You have one connection.

957
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,820
The next one is a
high-resilient, multi-site,

958
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,233
non-redundant connection.

959
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:36,450
It's a mouthful, but what
it means, essentially,

960
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,090
is that you're at two locations,

961
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,940
but you only have a single
connection at those locations.

962
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,710
And then finally, we have
the maximum resiliency,

963
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,390
multi-site redundant deployment,

964
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,200
which is at least four connections,

965
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,360
two at each site, and on
two different devices,

966
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,280
two different AWS devices.

967
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,800
So, those are for your maximum,

968
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,803
can't-have-downtime, super workloads.

969
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,360
And then just expanding on,

970
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,700
so Steve mentioned
MACSec a little bit ago.

971
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,110
There's another option that we see

972
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,690
with encryption over direct connect,

973
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,923
and that's using IPsec.

974
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,490
In that case, direct connect becomes

975
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,800
kind of like the transport underneath,

976
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,470
and then you apply your
IPsec tunnel over the top,

977
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,993
from VGW to your own firewall or router.

978
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,400
You can do this with
public or private IPs.

979
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,650
It used to be kind of problematic

980
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,380
because you'd be limited
to the tunnel size

981
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,780
of like 1.25 gigs per tunnel.

982
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,060
They recently upped that
to five gigs per tunnel,

983
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,560
so that actually really helps.

984
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,960
So, this becomes a bit
more of a viable option.

985
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,663
Okay.

986
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,183
On the subject of performance,

987
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,680
just keep in mind as well,

988
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,720
you can send as much bandwidth

989
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,493
as your EC2 instance can handle.

990
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,890
That's totally fine.

991
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,290
But keep in mind, if you're
doing benchmark testing

992
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,520
or something like that,
that a single flow,

993
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,830
like if you do an IPerf
or something like that,

994
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,660
a single flow, you can only get five gigs.

995
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,870
So, make sure you're
spreading it out a little bit.

996
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,550
And then just make sure you make the most

997
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,450
of your connections.

998
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,040
So, if you can support jumbo frames

999
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,890
on private and transit VIFs, do that.

1000
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,300
Because you'll get the most out of it.

1001
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,920
Public VIFs, we only support 1500,

1002
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,710
but you still get the idea.

1003
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,410
And a pretty good blog post there.

1004
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,790
If you take a look at that, some good tips

1005
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,530
on how to improve your performance,

1006
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,930
make sure you're doing good.

1007
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,870
Okay, Steve.

1008
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,703
- Brilliant.

1009
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,640
Okay, so we've got our
connection up and running.

1010
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,500
We probably wanna understand how much

1011
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,030
this is going to cost.

1012
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,370
And this is a question that
comes up quite regularly

1013
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,870
in customer discussions that I have.

1014
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,270
So, what I thought I would
do is just put together

1015
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,880
a couple of examples so you
can consider the components

1016
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,710
that are involved when you're working at

1017
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,350
how much does Direct Connect cost you.

1018
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,330
So, in our example, we're gonna have

1019
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,980
a very simple setup to start with.

1020
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,890
So, we have our EC2
instance running in a VPC.

1021
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,800
In this example, it's in US West 2.

1022
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,570
We have a Direct Connect location,

1023
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,970
which I've chosen for it to be in London.

1024
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,690
And I have my customer
location on-premises.

1025
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,980
This is how they're connected together.

1026
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,590
Obviously, this is a non-redundant setup,

1027
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,140
thinking back to what Josh
was telling you about.

1028
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,640
So, what do we need to consider?

1029
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,310
When you're looking at pricing of anything

1030
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,980
to do with data transfer inside AWS,

1031
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,260
you need to consider
it in both directions.

1032
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,450
So, in the first instance,
we're gonna consider

1033
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:47,450
data transfer between AWS going
towards a customer network.

1034
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,390
What are the costs that
we need to consider

1035
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,900
in this particular scenario?

1036
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,430
Well, perhaps the most obvious one

1037
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,680
is the Direct Connect port itself.

1038
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,290
So, there is a charge for
the Direct Connect port.

1039
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,660
It's charged per hour, and it's charged

1040
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,750
from when the connection
comes up for the first time,

1041
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,850
or 90 days have elapsed from the point

1042
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,500
that you ordered the connection.

1043
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,150
We recognize that when you click order,

1044
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,040
it's very unlikely that
you're gonna be able

1045
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,230
to plug in immediately
and benefit from that.

1046
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,520
There's gonna be time involved

1047
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,630
to arrange all those
cross-connects, those circuits,

1048
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,690
everything I talked about earlier on.

1049
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,910
But once that connection
comes up and is stable,

1050
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,390
we'll start billing at an
hourly rate for that port.

1051
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,650
And you'll get that charge now

1052
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,020
until you completely delete that port.

1053
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,460
So, that's an important thing to remember,

1054
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,920
and it's consistent through
each of the architectures

1055
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,870
I'm gonna show you.

1056
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,930
The next piece is the data transfer itself

1057
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,300
from the EC2 instance,

1058
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,240
leaving AWS going towards
your infrastructure.

1059
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,130
And when you look at our pricing pages,

1060
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,360
that's where you see the wording

1061
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,620
data transfer from AWS
region or local zone.

1062
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,740
And it's charged per gigabyte transferred.

1063
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,500
The way this works is you go
and look at the pricing table,

1064
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,590
you identify where is
the traffic coming from.

1065
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,370
So, in this case, from the
continuous US, for example,

1066
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,590
and it's going to Europe.

1067
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,290
You can then work out how
much that's going to cost you

1068
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,120
per gigabyte transferred.

1069
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,170
So, the table for that is

1070
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,820
on the Direct Connect pricing page.

1071
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,770
In fact, that's where you
can find all of the answers

1072
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,870
for these examples.

1073
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,640
So, this is, as I say, a simple setup

1074
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,210
with Direct Connect gateway
and a virtual private gateway.

1075
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,050
What about data transfer into
AWS in this architecture?

1076
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,430
Well, in this case,

1077
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,380
we still have the Direct Connect port fee.

1078
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,310
Obviously, it's not being
charged twice in this situation,

1079
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,900
but that's still a constant.

1080
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,450
But for data transfer
in, in this situation,

1081
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,610
where we're going via a
virtual private gateway,

1082
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,910
we don't charge you for
any data transfer inbound

1083
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,903
in this scenario.

1084
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,010
Let's look at a variation of that.

1085
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,840
What about with Transit Gateway?

1086
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,430
So, we still got our
Direct Connect gateway.

1087
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,950
We've now got, though, the
Transit Gateway on that path,

1088
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,260
and perhaps you've got
many hundreds or thousands

1089
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,140
of VPCs connected to that Transit Gateway.

1090
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,520
So, once again, let's look at it

1091
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,110
from the perspective of data transfer

1092
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,200
out from AWS to your infrastructure.

1093
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,480
We have good old port hour charge there.

1094
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,580
That's still the same.

1095
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,190
We also have the data transfer charge.

1096
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,810
That's still the same as well.

1097
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:13,890
No difference there.

1098
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,430
We're moving data across
the AWS infrastructure.

1099
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,440
But the addition of the Transit Gateway

1100
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,050
does mean that we now have to consider

1101
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,220
a per hour attachment charge,

1102
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,450
and we've got two attachments,

1103
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,990
one towards Direct Connect,
one towards the VPC,

1104
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,910
and then we have a data processing charge

1105
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,920
for the Transit Gateway.

1106
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,840
So, in this scenario,
they're the components

1107
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,550
you would add together to calculate

1108
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,300
how much this particular
workload would be costing you.

1109
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,130
Let's look at it from
the other perspective,

1110
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,980
data transfer into AWS
with this architecture.

1111
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,120
Still got the same components,

1112
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,350
Transit Gateway sitting there.

1113
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,443
So, our old friend, the port
hour charge, still there.

1114
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,050
Data transfer coming into AWS,
there's no charge for that,

1115
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,710
but we do still have the
Transit Gateway on that path.

1116
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,500
So, what that means is we still
have the attachment charge,

1117
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,270
and again, this is not
being charged twice.

1118
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,300
It's the same attachments we
talked about a moment ago,

1119
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,340
and there is the data processing charge

1120
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,480
for the traffic that is moving

1121
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,043
through that Transit Gateway.

1122
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,590
So, I mention both of these scenarios

1123
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,060
because you could have a scenario

1124
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,920
where it's useful to use

1125
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,590
the Virtual Private Gateway architecture

1126
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,430
for certain workloads,

1127
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,780
and perhaps the Transit Gateway

1128
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,543
or Cloud WAN-based
architecture for another.

1129
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,720
Josh mentioned SiteLink,

1130
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,040
so I wanted to just cover off
how we bill for that as well.

1131
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,420
In this situation, I've added

1132
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,580
another Direct Connect location in.

1133
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,780
It's here in Las Vegas,

1134
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,290
and therefore I now have expanded

1135
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,970
to have a US office for this organization.

1136
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,560
The EC2 infrastructure's still there.

1137
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,780
I've grayed it out because
the billing for that

1138
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,300
is exactly what I've been
talking about so far.

1139
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,133
But for SiteLink,

1140
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:51,450
there's a couple of
other things to consider.

1141
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,550
When you create the virtual interfaces

1142
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,010
that you're going to use for SiteLink,

1143
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,980
you're gonna attach those
to a Direct Connect gateway.

1144
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,510
We've still got the port hour charges.

1145
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,740
They're still there.

1146
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,420
We create the virtual interfaces,

1147
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,710
and we check that box
that Josh showed you.

1148
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,090
At that point, we've now enabled SiteLink,

1149
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,470
and there is a charge for
enabling that capability

1150
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,923
on each of those virtual interfaces.

1151
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,133
Once you've done that,

1152
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:17,490
the traffic is now able to flow

1153
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,210
between my UK office location
and my US office location,

1154
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,520
going through the Direct
Connect infrastructure.

1155
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,770
And to work out how much that costs,

1156
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,260
you need to now go and look up on a table

1157
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,770
that we have on the
Direct Connect website.

1158
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,020
So for traffic flowing
from the UK to the US,

1159
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,270
you would go and look up in the table

1160
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,990
and identify this traffic is
coming from Europe to the US,

1161
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,120
and then vice versa,
traffic the other way,

1162
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,550
you'd go and look up the
table in the other direction.

1163
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,200
And as you can see in this example,

1164
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,300
it's actually the same charge here,

1165
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,800
but that's how you calculate

1166
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,053
the pricing involved for SiteLink.

1167
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,540
Okay, now there's a few
components involved in there,

1168
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,680
and I wanted to share something

1169
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,990
that we published a few months back,

1170
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,710
which was the open source
networking focused calculator.

1171
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,720
We have the AWS pricing calculator,

1172
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,670
I'm sure you've all seen that.

1173
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,040
But we actually have this
tool that we put out there

1174
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,920
for you to be able to
deploy and use yourselves

1175
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,160
to help calculate anything
to do with networking on AWS.

1176
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,260
It pulls from our pricing APIs.

1177
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,550
And I just wanted to mention it,

1178
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,170
there's a blog post all about it.

1179
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,370
So if you're trying to calculate

1180
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,500
how much these architectures
cost in advance,

1181
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,550
you may want to deploy the
pricing calculator tool

1182
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,900
that we've published there.

1183
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:42,290
- So you may have seen
over the last few days,

1184
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,610
we announced this new capability

1185
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,950
called AWS Interconnect Multicloud

1186
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,900
in partnership with Google and Preview.

1187
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,410
I just wanted to spend
a quick second on it.

1188
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,693
I think it's super cool, personally.

1189
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,670
What it does is allows you
to kind of create capacity

1190
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,030
to another cloud, to GCP in this case.

1191
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,130
What we're doing is building in

1192
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,900
our maximum resiliency model.

1193
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,880
So the four-wide connectivity

1194
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,860
that I was talking about before,

1195
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,840
it's all pre-cabled, it's all pre-built.

1196
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,370
All you have to do is go and say,

1197
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,510
I want one gig, I want 50
megs, whatever you want.

1198
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,503
And you can get that from us
through this new offering.

1199
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,940
So GCP for now, I think Rob Kennedy said

1200
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,320
in his innovation talk today,

1201
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,320
first half 26 for Azure to
be added to this as well.

1202
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,700
And there was a talk earlier today,

1203
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,870
so unfortunately you missed that,

1204
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,650
but a deep dive onto this,
I think it was NET205.

1205
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,600
- Five, it was, yeah.

1206
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,340
- So if you wanna go
look that up on YouTube,

1207
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,800
probably in the next day
or so, it'll pop up there

1208
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,713
if you wanna get more information on that.

1209
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,440
All right, and just to wrap up,

1210
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,190
some things that we want you
to take away and remember.

1211
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,570
So first of all, just going
all your way through the layers

1212
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,610
as you configure and troubleshoot,

1213
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,983
start layer one and kind
of work your way up.

1214
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,613
Using the right VIF for the right job.

1215
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,190
A lot of times you can't use the wrong VIF

1216
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,140
for the wrong job, but it is
good to kind of consider that.

1217
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,000
Getting a good idea of what
you're gonna do with BGP.

1218
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,490
Are you gonna need to
do some summarization?

1219
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,790
What do you need to do
with the communities?

1220
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,860
Like, do you need to
configure active, active,

1221
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,110
active, passive, what
are you thinking there?

1222
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,460
You wanna design for resilience, right?

1223
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,830
So again, as you're building,

1224
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,220
are you trying to meet a
particular sort of SLA?

1225
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,580
Is this a high available
workload or is it a,

1226
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,280
I'm just testing and I don't care.

1227
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,410
And then obviously test and test and test

1228
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,860
and make sure everything
fails over as it should.

1229
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,020
Understand how to calculate your costs.

1230
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,020
I think that solution,
the open source solution

1231
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,450
is a really great way to do that.

1232
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,040
Or you can go watch this on YouTube

1233
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,190
and rewind and watch the
last five minutes again.

1234
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,620
And then just embracing your capabilities.

1235
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,180
So if you're using Direct Connect,

1236
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,180
Direct Collider VGWs, try
out Direct Connect Gateway.

1237
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,640
It's super easy, doesn't add any cost,

1238
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,810
doesn't add any latency,

1239
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,570
and really just kind of
expands your portfolio.

1240
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,130
Try out Transit Gateways,
try out SiteLink,

1241
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,903
try out Cloud WAN, try out InterConnect.

1242
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,833
Yeah, thank you very much.
