  "abstract": "Development leaders are struggling to show the impact of AI in software development. No single tool, such as Amazon Q Developer, can give the full picture. In this session hear from Genesys about their journey to measure the impact of AI and how the integration of Amazon Q Developer metrics into the Jellyfish platform gave them the visibility they needed. Attendees will learn about ways that AI Impacts software development, how the ingestion of Q Developer metrics into Jellyfish can shed light on those impacts over time and how a customer took that information and was able to tell the story of the impact of AI on their Development process.",
