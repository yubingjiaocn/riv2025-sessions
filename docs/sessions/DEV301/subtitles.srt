1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,169
Hopefully you're all here for this session. If

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,829
not, there's still enough time to leave.

3
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:08,069
I'm Anna. I'm a developer advocate at AWS,

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:10,380
and I'm very honored to be joined by David

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,589
here. He's an AWS community hero.

6
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:15,060
Thank you, David. Thank you for the

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,630
for the invite.

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,949
My name is uh Victoria. I'm from Mexico. Sorry for

9
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,789
my bad English.

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,769
So today,

11
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:21,329
uh, we're going to talk,

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,809
uh, what are these

13
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,388
agentic workflow means and how we

14
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:27,750
can take advantage on the local

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,568
LLMs.

16
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,010
So. First, let's talk

17
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,929
about the pain point,

18
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,139
the cost of downtime.

19
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,539
Aberde research told

20
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,319
us that

21
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:39,399
in

22
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,209
the average cost of unplanned downtime industrial

23
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,399
operations are more than 2,060,000

24
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,679
per hour.

25
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:48,950
So

26
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,520
there are a lot of industries affected

27
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:52,598
by this,

28
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,859
um, problems. So and

29
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,560
I will take

30
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,969
the stage on that. Yeah, we'll cover some of them, but

31
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,098
there are many others. So mining, you're

32
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,478
underground usually.

33
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,770
Without any signal,

34
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,448
there's manufacturing where you're in remote

35
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,629
plants with legacy infrastructure,

36
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,409
oil and gas, usually on offshore

37
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,609
platforms in many miles

38
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,349
into the sea.

39
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,159
Energy,

40
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,000
government with data sovereignty requirements,

41
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,959
and retail.

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,849
Just a few of many industries that

43
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,049
can be affected by this problem. If

44
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,680
you want to run AI agents,

45
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,209
you require cloud.

46
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,409
So what's the cloud dependency problem that we've been talking

47
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,698
about? We're at a factory

48
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:38,000
and we want to analyze sensor

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,120
data and if we have Internet

50
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,730
connection

51
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:43,528
everything's OK. We talk to agents through Bedrock

52
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:44,680
and we're good to go,

53
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,290
but once that connection goes down,

54
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,980
then we have a problem.

55
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:51,338
What do we do?

56
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,069
So what do agents require

57
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,230
to work offline?

58
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,650
So first of all, agents are powered by

59
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,879
large language models, so they need to think, they

60
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,349
need to reason locally

61
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,790
so that we're gonna be running those agents locally.

62
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,930
Agents are powered by

63
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,469
LLMs, but they need the ability to take actions,

64
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,528
and agents do that through tools, so they

65
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:14,740
also need to be able to use those tools locally,

66
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,149
not through the internet.

67
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,979
They need to keep context between different sessions

68
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,338
so they have memory.

69
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,149
And then finally once we have connectivity

70
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,349
again to sync that information to

71
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,788
and from the cloud,

72
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,240
all of those things are required for agents

73
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,550
to work uh offline.

74
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,490
And the

75
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,808
solution that the VNI found and we're

76
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,409
bringing to you today

77
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,129
is using

78
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,000
strength agents SDK

79
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,649
and Olama together to have

80
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,710
the power of agents in

81
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,788
the edge. Let's ask Ana to

82
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:50,528
the audience

83
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,069
who have worked with strength agents

84
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,149
or an agentic orchestration

85
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,149
tool. Show of hands.

86
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,038
Great,

87
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,129
fantastic.

88
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,110
Who has used Olama to run locally.

89
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,949
Perfect, fantastic.

90
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:07,538
So we're all on the same page.

91
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,439
So the hybrid architecture that we built

92
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,960
and that we're proposing here today is

93
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,439
using strands agent to do the reasoning

94
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,300
using tools, having memory,

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,199
and when we're offline we're using models

96
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,750
through Olema

97
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,360
and the custom local tools that we created

98
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,219
for strengths

99
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,558
and when we're online we're back into the

100
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:29,500
clouds with Bedrock.

101
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,808
So talking a little bit about Olama,

102
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,099
Olama is an open source tool that helps us to

103
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,610
run lightweight LLMs on

104
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,618
our own computers. In fact, I can run

105
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:43,240
in my

106
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:45,240
old MacBook, uh,

107
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,439
small models like 8

108
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,849
billion parameters, uh, queen.

109
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,610
But we have a

110
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,409
A catalog of LLMs that we can

111
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,250
use with Olama.

112
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,929
We have models from uh from Google,

113
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,770
for instance, uh Hema 3

114
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,939
Mistra AI, uh,

115
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:05,490
powerful models from Meta Lama,

116
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,808
basically Deeps see 5

117
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,929
Queen GPT OSS,

118
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,330
and many more other models that we can run,

119
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,588
uh, in local, um,

120
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,910
facilities.

121
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:17,928
So

122
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,730
Olama will be giving us the power of

123
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,369
the model.

124
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,898
But agents require not

125
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:24,658
only models.

126
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,937
There's this whole thing that we call the agentic

127
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:27,519
loop

128
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,538
where it performs a bunch of steps

129
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,617
until it's happy with the response and

130
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:34,437
it sends it back to the user.

131
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:35,677
So how does it work?

132
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,920
First part is the reasoning part

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,160
where we receive the user input.

134
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,778
We process that input with a large

135
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:44,540
language model.

136
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,290
And then the model decides if it

137
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,488
needs to call additional tools or if it's

138
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,309
ready to send a response or not.

139
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,819
Then we have the actions, which are the tools

140
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,778
that the the model can call.

141
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,290
With these actions we are going to

142
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:04,559
send and receive inputs that can accomplish

143
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,778
the task that the agent

144
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:09,338
is trying to finish and

145
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,410
if the agent determines that it's

146
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,149
ready to respond to the user,

147
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,660
the agent responds

148
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,939
the final output to the user.

149
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,509
So it's why we call it a loop.

150
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,629
It keeps iterating between

151
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,088
reasoning with the model and actions

152
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,278
with the tools until it's happy with the

153
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:27,889
response.

154
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,509
The tools help add additional

155
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,588
context to the model and then it

156
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,750
gives the response back to the user. And that's why

157
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,970
I say that the the agents are

158
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,559
loops with superpowers.

159
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:41,269
So write these loops, superpower,

160
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,350
super powerful loops, it's hard.

161
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,971
So that's why we want to introduce

162
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,170
ourselves as Strength agents.

163
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,571
Strength Agents is an open source

164
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,591
Python and and since

165
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,951
yesterday also TypeScript,

166
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,610
SDK for building agents

167
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,521
using a few lines of code.

168
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,151
Basically. Strength agents is a

169
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:01,151
solution

170
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,471
think

171
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,562
for builders, so people that actually

172
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,562
write code. We are not reinventing the

173
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,954
wheel. We are only putting. The same

174
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,134
capabilities as a builder or developer needs

175
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,843
for agentic purposes.

176
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,514
Yes, and not only it's easy to use trends,

177
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,733
we're going to show you the code right now, but it

178
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,014
also is extensible, so we can add

179
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,194
tools, MCP,

180
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,913
memory management, a lot of different things

181
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:27,463
to make our agents more powerful,

182
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,052
and we're not only using

183
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,062
Amazon Bedrog LLMs.

184
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:32,843
In fact, we can use Olama.

185
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,375
We can use first party APIs

186
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,745
like Anthropic API, Open API,

187
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,815
and other vendors like

188
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:42,255
Grok, etc.

189
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:44,975
So it's a very extensible tool, and

190
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,096
agnostic, let's say, for a single

191
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:49,415
vendor. Yes, so we create the model,

192
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:51,565
we give it the tools, all the information

193
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,045
that it needs, the

194
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:55,334
capabilities that it has, and we

195
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,725
can simply switch to different models

196
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:58,574
if we want to.

197
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,449
So let's start reviewing a

198
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,449
single agent, the most basic

199
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:05,009
agent.

200
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,649
First we have to import the library

201
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,389
with import strands and then we

202
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,028
can instance an agent with the default

203
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:16,488
features. What is the default features basically,

204
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,649
um, Amazon

205
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,189
Bedrock with clotsonnet 4.0

206
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:23,970
in the Oregon region.

207
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:24,970
That's all.

208
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,709
So after that we can start,

209
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,588
uh, working with an agent,

210
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,350
sending a prompt, receiving an answer, accomplish

211
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,588
this powerful agenttic loop.

212
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,319
So this is the simplest agent that we can

213
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,319
create using strengths. If

214
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,559
we don't define a model, we're using the default

215
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,988
one. But

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,350
how about if we talk about

217
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,879
an agent that works locally,

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,379
so we need to import only

219
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,298
the Olama

220
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,608
model library.

221
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,439
In this case I'm importing some tools that

222
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,600
are um that I

223
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,338
create before

224
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,199
for my workload specifically

225
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,369
for instance I create a tool for read sensors

226
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,778
trigger an alert, etc.

227
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,319
uh that that custom tools are created

228
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,358
and we're going to talk about a little bit

229
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,500
later about how the tools works

230
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,660
but let's continue with the code.

231
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:18,600
Great. So now I am creating an

232
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,579
agent but

233
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,399
setting the model, uh,

234
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,600
isolama model where.

235
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:27,285
Uh, we have running now

236
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,553
Olama and our host.

237
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:31,295
We define the local host, the port, and the model ID.

238
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,955
In this case we are using IPSI in the 8

239
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:35,955
billion parameters model.

240
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:38,394
So in the previous example we're

241
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,634
not specifying the model. Now we're specifying

242
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:41,614
this model through Ola.

243
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,940
And for sure we need to include the tools that the

244
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,950
agent will be able to use to

245
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,308
accomplish the mission.

246
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
The system from basically what

247
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,038
the model needs to accomplish, what is the main task

248
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,619
that the er models that the agent

249
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,058
will work with.

250
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,859
Yeah, I like to say that it's the model's personality.

251
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,129
One important thing that this system prompt have is

252
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,418
that we are indicating that this model

253
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,739
is that this agent is it's working

254
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:11,629
fully offline

255
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,019
so the model will not

256
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,058
try to reach internet or to reach

257
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,538
external source or features.

258
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,729
At the end we only start

259
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,259
working with the agent sending a prompt

260
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,690
in this case checking our sensor

261
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,090
and alerting if

262
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,109
uh anything is wrong,

263
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:31,788
how using the tools that we have previously defined.

264
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,349
So here with less than 20 line of

265
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,538
lines of code we have a local model

266
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:39,029
using Olema and custom local tools

267
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,570
that our model can use.

268
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,038
Perfect. So our agents need

269
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,139
to take action. So how agents take

270
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:49,599
action outside the world,

271
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,210
that's the the meaning of the tools.

272
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,558
So how a tool works basically.

273
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,330
The agent

274
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:57,190
use a tool

275
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:58,428
to make an action

276
00:09:58,729 --> 00:09:59,408
externally.

277
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,769
I always say that the uh tools

278
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,769
are like the the small handies of

279
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,869
the agents because have this powerful

280
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,869
to extend the capabilities outside

281
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,729
the scope of the, the single agent.

282
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,129
So how, how, what kind of actions

283
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,369
we can take, for instance, in this case, in this

284
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:15,330
specific workloads,

285
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,849
with sensors, analyze images, query

286
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,139
some databases, create work, uh, work orders,

287
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,450
send alerts, or anything that we can

288
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,129
code, how it works.

289
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,469
Here, we're gonna talk about things and then

290
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:28,229
show you the code.

291
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,710
So, here's how we create a Python

292
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,389
function that we can turn into a

293
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,408
tool. Same as before,

294
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,029
we're importing the agents

295
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,469
and now the tool from from strengths.

296
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,779
Creating the

297
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,899
the function to read sensors

298
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,320
and then we have some important info here in the

299
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,259
documentation. No,

300
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,259
yeah, that's right.

301
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,029
So this function, uh,

302
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:57,590
this function Python function read a sensor

303
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,899
we receive the sensor ID

304
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,879
and we have a

305
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,639
local endpoint

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,889
to trigger to receive, uh,

307
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,279
sorry, pull

308
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:08,048
some data.

309
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,359
So this gate to a URL we are using

310
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,479
request, uh, as a library to

311
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,739
get uh the data from the URL

312
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,200
and that's all we receive the data

313
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,580
from that, uh, mod bus TCP

314
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,379
raise for status, wait for that.

315
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:23,580
Have the answer.

316
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,239
Create adjacent to return or a dictionary

317
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:26,779
to return

318
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:27,879
in the function,

319
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:30,359
but the most important thing here is not

320
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,428
the function itself. It's the

321
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,580
decorator, the tool decorator.

322
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,200
With a single decorator we are creating this

323
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,859
specific,

324
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,440
uh, function. We are converting this function

325
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,239
into a tool that an agent

326
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:43,960
can use.

327
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:47,320
One important thing, Anna,

328
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,219
duck string,

329
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,619
it's the way that we define

330
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,928
the agent,

331
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,940
what is the purpose of this, um,

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,509
of this function. In this case, the

333
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,460
duck string says that,

334
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:01,178
uh, you can use this for, uh, read real-time

335
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,678
data for industrial sensor,

336
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,279
and the arguments that you have to send is the sensor

337
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,200
ID, and that's all.

338
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,580
The agent with this dock string will

339
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,629
identify how to create the

340
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,639
invocation process, the execution process of

341
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,558
this tool.

342
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:16,960
So the dogs are super important, so the

343
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,080
agent knows not only what the tool does

344
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
but what information he needs to

345
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,599
call that tool.

346
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,759
And apart from custom tools like

347
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,058
the ones that we just showed you.

348
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:31,969
Strengths has a set of tools

349
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:34,690
that are ready to use for the

350
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,979
operations for the actions that we most frequently

351
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,149
use. So,

352
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,168
it has an HTTP request one that

353
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,529
we can use to query APIs,

354
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:44,950
talk to sensors,

355
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,690
has system ones that we can also use

356
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,570
to run local diagnostics.

357
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,119
Workflows

358
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,649
we can even

359
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,109
give in to a human in the loop when we need

360
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,048
more critical

361
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:00,428
approvals, and this is super important because

362
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,690
you know agents can work autonomously,

363
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,109
but the best practice indicate us to use

364
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,609
human in the loop to validate

365
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,168
that capabilities.

366
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,678
And file operations. So, here my

367
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:13,349
personal recommendation to you is to check the strengths

368
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,440
documentations to see the ones that you have available because

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,308
I did create a

370
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,479
custom tool to save files and then I

371
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,139
figured out

372
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,750
one already existed.

373
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:24,418
And there are many more. I mean, there is only

374
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,599
a subset of tools that we find

375
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,639
valuable for these warlocks, but there are many.

376
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,783
More community built tools

377
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:33,244
and one more important thing about

378
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,293
community tools, remember that red agents,

379
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:36,705
it's an open source

380
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,163
solution so you can

381
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,803
make a for, create a tool, open a PR,

382
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,474
and the the strength agentsten

383
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:46,803
team can validate that tool and maybe

384
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,744
include into into the next release.

385
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,119
Perfect.

386
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,849
So let's talk how we can

387
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:57,639
interact with other

388
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,158
caveman systems.

389
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,139
So we have our agents running in

390
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,259
the edge, and even though we're

391
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,500
used to now having G AIs and chatbots

392
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
and models wherever we are, there are still

393
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,899
systems that require all

394
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,058
systems, yes, more primitive

395
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:16,509
data. So

396
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,000
that's why we have the structured output, uh,

397
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,700
as Ana mentioned, we have some ERPs,

398
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:23,710
CRMs, MIS, etc.

399
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,879
that, uh,

400
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,710
talk with other with other systems using

401
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,808
let's say APIs.

402
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,769
Hopefully maybe a lot of

403
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,859
these systems use rest APIs,

404
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,239
but other other systems

405
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,700
still use soap

406
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,750
envelopes to communicate with.

407
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,168
So we structured outputs how it works

408
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,288
basically the agent can receive.

409
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:47,585
Byanic model. Byanic model is only

410
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,923
a thing to define a data structure.

411
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,244
For instance, we have a a set

412
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,283
of data that we we need to

413
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:56,364
send to the API so we

414
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,234
can define the specific um

415
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:01,094
JSON format, let's say.

416
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:03,509
And then we can send the Pythonic

417
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,918
model to the agent and receive the

418
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:08,019
specific Jason as our answer

419
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,460
without any other data, you know,

420
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:13,399
models are very verbose, yes,

421
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,759
so we don't want to get a bunch of texts

422
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,840
and send that to an external system

423
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,379
that's expecting

424
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,639
an API call with specific

425
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,960
data. That's why we are using

426
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,820
structure output

427
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,119
andres has a really nice way of doing that.

428
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,690
So we, we're using pedantic here as David

429
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,808
mentioned, and we're creating this model

430
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,129
for a work order.

431
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,690
So here we're specifying the fields and

432
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,288
their types, and we even have a description

433
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,349
so the model can have additional information

434
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,769
on what those fields are.

435
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,288
So we have a part ID, the priority,

436
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,389
description, and estimated hours.

437
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,950
And that's our structured output.

438
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,849
And now when we are interacting with

439
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:56,509
the agent,

440
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,158
we Send the agent

441
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,940
that exact information

442
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,658
so we can answer us with.

443
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,668
The data type that other systems are

444
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,678
expecting in this example,

445
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,369
uh we are um talking

446
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,869
with the agent that the compressor

447
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:16,029
have an abnormal vibration that agent

448
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,649
maybe have some tools to analyze that

449
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:19,649
information and

450
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:22,288
with the structured output we're creating adjacent

451
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,548
or a dictionary with this

452
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:27,229
with that specific uh fields

453
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,288
in the exact order using the same

454
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,769
uh um values that

455
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,009
we are expecting too

456
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,558
so. After

457
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:38,119
that we can validate that results,

458
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,960
get into that variables directly, uh,

459
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,099
as part of the, the code,

460
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,269
and at last we can send this

461
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,739
information to an external system

462
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:50,678
without any intervention. Automatically

463
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,759
the agent is capable to create the

464
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,908
JSON and send

465
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:56,288
into the uh the

466
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:58,418
API. So instead

467
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,979
of sending a very large text saying

468
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,259
probably excellent question, this is your,

469
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,618
what you're looking for, we're sending the

470
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:07,699
specific data or external systems need.

471
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,778
Fantastic. So up until now we

472
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,778
talked about tools which are how

473
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:15,479
agents take actions.

474
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:18,218
We talked about some community tools

475
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,327
and we talked about how to structure our

476
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,347
output so our agents can communicate with

477
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:23,528
external systems.

478
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,837
What else? What else do we need?

479
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,917
So our agents,

480
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,577
we don't want them to forget things that happened, right?

481
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:33,019
So if a specific machine

482
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,378
required maintenance or was showing

483
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,378
an abnormal temperature or something.

484
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,689
We want the agent to remember that.

485
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,348
So we have session management

486
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,209
out of the box session management with persistent

487
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,939
memory with strength agents.

488
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,239
So in the case without,

489
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,489
without sessions, maybe we are, we

490
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,489
are interacting with the agent

491
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,650
and asking about check on pressure

492
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,890
or the agent and the agent

493
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,930
found some, some important data.

494
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:03,189
But maybe the app crashes.

495
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,130
The legacy hardware that we are using,

496
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:08,029
uh, power off. There's a power outage.

497
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:10,410
Yes, so if the app starts

498
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:11,368
and you ask again,

499
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,049
they just will say.

500
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,969
What are you talking about, man?

501
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,170
I don't, I don't know what are you talking about.

502
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,400
So like me yesterday at the omnia,

503
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:22,529
we don't want that to happen.

504
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,608
So with sessions

505
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,009
it's a whole different story.

506
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:29,430
The user asks the agent to

507
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,568
check on the compressor,

508
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,250
and then if the app restarts.

509
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:36,449
The agent can keep the conversation going.

510
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:39,739
Great. So

511
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,098
how it works basically, we only need

512
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:43,259
to import the library.

513
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:46,180
So, um, we import file session

514
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,439
manager. It's important to notice that,

515
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,779
uh, one agents have other ways to manage

516
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,098
the sessions like Dynamo DB, S3,

517
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,358
etc. But in this case we don't have connection.

518
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,759
We are not going to use that tools. So

519
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,979
we are using the file session manager. We only have

520
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:00,519
to define

521
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,009
the session ID that can be a unique

522
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,059
ID. Uh, per

523
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,338
user per unit per

524
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,180
machine, etc.

525
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,759
and we are going to store the data.

526
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,618
In this case we are storing the data in JSON format

527
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,660
locally in the same

528
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,900
computer that the agent is running.

529
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,618
And the agent

530
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,229
will receive the session manager

531
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,410
instance, and that's all.

532
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:26,828
The agent will be able

533
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:29,670
to uh communicate

534
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,689
and remember things

535
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,729
across the context.

536
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,209
Yeah, and here we're using the local file

537
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,729
system but we could be using SQL

538
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,729
or Reddit there or

539
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:43,170
if we're connected to the cloud other solutions.

540
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,848
At last, model context protocol.

541
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,368
This is a well known protocol created

542
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:51,239
by Anthropic last year.

543
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,578
We are now in the

544
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:55,949
and Model context Protocol is basically

545
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:56,930
a tool

546
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,328
that, uh, other vendors can expose to

547
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,769
you. You can, uh, install

548
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,769
or instance in your strength agent,

549
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,509
uh, agent,

550
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:05,989
and automatically

551
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,969
all the tools and data sources that that MCP,

552
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,130
uh, describes are available for you.

553
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,009
What do we have in the code?

554
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:16,890
Let's check.

555
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,250
So we have our imports

556
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:21,368
as usual.

557
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:24,338
And one thing that I appreciate about rends

558
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:26,348
is that we can import those

559
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:28,348
tools from the library and use them, same as

560
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,348
we did for the session management

561
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,068
or for the custom tools.

562
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,229
We don't have to be creating things ourselves.

563
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,618
We import our custom uh tools

564
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:42,140
and in this case I am uh importing

565
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,259
or calling an MCP server from

566
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:44,818
MongoDB.

567
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:45,880
Notice

568
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:49,098
sorry that at the end of the arguments

569
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:51,140
we have a local host URL

570
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,818
URI, so we are invoking a a

571
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:54,380
Mongo

572
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:55,519
collection locally.

573
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:00,848
So if you're using MCP

574
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:02,549
servers on your

575
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,930
coding assistant or on cloud

576
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,848
desktop,

577
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,380
you're used to that type of

578
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,380
information. But if not, we

579
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,949
just need to say which how the

580
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,140
The model is gonna communicate with that

581
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,309
information. Here's locally, so we're using

582
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:18,930
UV

583
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,009
and then

584
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:20,969
the

585
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,750
the arguments for MongoDB.

586
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,848
After that

587
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,509
we need to have to

588
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:30,199
import the full list of Mongo MCP

589
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,309
and then pass as a tool into

590
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:34,868
the agent.

591
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:37,660
So MCP is no more than like

592
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,078
tools exposed by third party

593
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,719
vendors that you can import

594
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,180
as a custom tool. Yes, but here

595
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,420
instead of David and I creating

596
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,559
custom Python code that would connect

597
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,900
to our local Mongo DB database

598
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,088
and get that information,

599
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,618
we're using the MCP server that already

600
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:55,299
exists for that.

601
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,750
And we can keep talking to

602
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,809
the agent as we've been doing so far.

603
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,180
So in this case with this Mongo MCP server

604
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,180
we are able to communicate to the the

605
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,828
database,

606
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,479
uh, show collections,

607
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:12,150
insert, um, uh, attributes,

608
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:14,299
insert data, modify data in

609
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,858
uh we can delete data too, so

610
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,059
it's important to implement human in the loop

611
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:21,098
process to validate if the action that

612
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:23,318
the agent going to take it's the best path

613
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:24,828
to accomplish the task.

614
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,459
Yeah, and here we're saving log information to

615
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:28,150
Mongo DB.

616
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:31,890
OK, so we showed you the code. Now

617
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,009
it's time for you to see it

618
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:37,269
running. Great,

619
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,348
who knows Quo?

620
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,939
No. The people

621
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:45,088
that know that don't know Kiro, it's

622
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:46,279
under the rocks, or?

623
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,719
Just joking. Quiro is the new agentic

624
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:50,890
idea from AWS.

625
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,608
It's an amazing tool to build

626
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:54,989
solutions. Let's open.

627
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:56,910
My

628
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:08,900
Perfect. Demo

629
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,299
perfect. So the reason

630
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,368
why we talked about Hiro is because

631
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:15,559
Hiro helped us build this demo

632
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,979
today. 100%,

633
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,680
but spec driven development, not vibe coding.

634
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,519
So this is a Jupiter notebook. This is not

635
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,289
the final demo. This is a

636
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:26,098
baby step

637
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,358
process. First we are going to.

638
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,420
Review how it works. Every of these,

639
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,568
uh, capabilities

640
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,900
that we, uh, talked previously.

641
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,598
This, uh, Jupiter notebook will be available

642
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:41,039
in our GitHub repo, so you later

643
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,529
will be able to, uh,

644
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,959
interact with them. Yeah, we have a QR code

645
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,199
for that on the next slide.

646
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,259
Great. That's a start. So

647
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,118
we are instancing

648
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,229
a, uh,

649
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:53,900
Olama model local host.

650
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,979
Notice that we are using a custom

651
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,140
model. A community model.

652
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,390
Why? Because Quant 3 is an

653
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,979
amazing model, but has the thinking

654
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,199
process and think a lot,

655
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,338
so thinking takes a lot of time.

656
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,719
For demo purposes we are using a not thinking

657
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,809
model to

658
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,969
speed the capabilities and works

659
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:16,779
very good. I mean,

660
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,328
accomplished all the tasks that we have in

661
00:24:19,328 --> 00:24:21,469
the demo. Full disclosure here that

662
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:22,750
David is off the internet.

663
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,088
That's why his trends server is

664
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,739
not working.

665
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:30,779
So We

666
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,858
are using this uh model

667
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,279
blah blah blah. OK, perfect.

668
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:36,400
The Olama model is configured

669
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,019
first tool decorator.

670
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:39,930
We have here,

671
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,328
obviously this is mock-up data

672
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,989
because we don't have IOT devices here, but

673
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:46,568
imagine that you have some devices

674
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:49,009
with some data that we you can pull

675
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,348
in production like temperature sensors,

676
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,299
humidity sensors, value actuators,

677
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,709
etc. I am going to

678
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,348
create a reed sensor tool

679
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:00,949
uh sorry function but with the tool

680
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,130
decorator now

681
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,618
this function it's able to

682
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:05,430
use by the agent.

683
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,500
So, same as we saw on the slides,

684
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,890
we give the documentation

685
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,019
information to the agents so he knows what

686
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,358
those tools are going to be doing.

687
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,509
And how to call them.

688
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,049
On the other hand, we have a control device, basically

689
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,209
a tool that indicates a

690
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:23,868
specific

691
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,809
IOT device that we can interact

692
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,049
with to take another action.

693
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:33,959
So, I'm going to run this piece of code.

694
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,799
We have these 3, these 2 different

695
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:38,059
functions ready.

696
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:40,828
And we have 3

697
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,289
devices available temperature sensor,

698
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:44,568
humidity sensor,

699
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,769
and valve actor.

700
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:49,529
How we can use this tool with an agent.

701
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:52,078
So basically we create, we create

702
00:25:52,078 --> 00:25:52,759
an agent,

703
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:53,779
we set

704
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
the Olama model that we previously

705
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,489
instanced. We inject

706
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,799
the tools, the two different tools that

707
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,699
we created before,

708
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,660
and in with a system pro the

709
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,098
LLM personality

710
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:07,848
we, uh, define

711
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,279
what this agent will accomplish. So

712
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,439
it's an IOT control agent for an

713
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,559
industrial facility and it's gonna help

714
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,519
users monitor the sensors.

715
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:19,699
I can ask to the IUT agent, what

716
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,818
is the current temperature of the production floor,

717
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:23,500
so we indicate what

718
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,680
which sensor I need to analyze.

719
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:28,078
And now

720
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,078
The agent is answering me. The current on the production floor, it's

721
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:33,519
24:19.

722
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:37,420
Let's control tractor.

723
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,630
The IOT agent will receive the open the

724
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,469
cooling system,

725
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:45,068
the name of the valve that needs to open.

726
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,689
And now it's taking action. It's

727
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,689
calling the

728
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,608
tool to take an action and open.

729
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,029
The

730
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,219
system evolve.

731
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:00,858
Another amazing capability that that agents

732
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:03,328
bring to us it's the multi-process,

733
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,420
uh, multi-step operations.

734
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:06,400
For instance,

735
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:08,939
in a single shot operation you send a prompt

736
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:10,140
and the LLM

737
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:11,759
response. That's all.

738
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,039
In the agenttic loop,

739
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,338
the agent receives a complex or maybe

740
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:17,900
in this case two different, um,

741
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,239
responsibilities or operations,

742
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,269
and the agent

743
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,539
will accomplish every task

744
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,299
and after that will answer you.

745
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,779
So with the multi-step operation,

746
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:29,818
I mean,

747
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,640
I ask him, check the humidity first task.

748
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,759
And tell me if it's in an acceptable range.

749
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:37,578
2nd task.

750
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:41,150
Reed sensor

751
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,689
uh the agent used the tool with sensor

752
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:47,029
uh got the storage area

753
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,108
humidity and then validates

754
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,338
with a second tool.

755
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,279
If it's an acceptable range.

756
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,390
Great, this is the first.

757
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,789
Let's check the demo number 2,

758
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:01,209
the structured output.

759
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,750
There are a lot of Scada systems integrated

760
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,430
in industry, but a lot of them creates

761
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,598
this. Let's run

762
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:11,828
this Create

763
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:12,529
these awful

764
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:13,868
responses

765
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:15,269
basically text

766
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,439
TXT files

767
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,430
without any parsing process uh

768
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,789
basically it's for printing and uh

769
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:23,868
human readable but the system need

770
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,868
to understand and get data

771
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,170
from this scatter response

772
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,729
so. We have here

773
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,509
different Byanic models,

774
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,160
sensor reading, uh, Byanic

775
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,289
model, alarm info, equipment

776
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:38,910
status, and production metrics.

777
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,328
Every of, uh, every one of

778
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,789
these, um, models have a specific

779
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:45,328
data definition,

780
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,729
uh, not only in naming

781
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,769
pro in the naming but in the data

782
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,750
type. I'm

783
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,699
going to run this.

784
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,348
So,

785
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,818
we are simulating a scatter response.

786
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:07,000
Basically

787
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,920
this

788
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:09,299
TXT file

789
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,309
and then

790
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:13,019
with an uh small agent

791
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:16,160
er that have a data extraction task

792
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,318
we can

793
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,809
uh get.

794
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,519
The structured output.

795
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:25,130
Of the Scala report.

796
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:28,088
Basically, with production metrics,

797
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,838
we er um extract

798
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:31,809
successfully the data

799
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:32,709
and now.

800
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,670
We can access individual fields

801
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,150
from this structured output.

802
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:44,229
We can use that structured output,

803
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,828
as we mentioned to send directly to other.

804
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:49,068
Systems.

805
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:54,469
Can, can we go back a little bit

806
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,890
on the, when we talk to the agent

807
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,989
when we talk to the agent here, so

808
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:03,328
when, when we say that the structure

809
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:05,529
output model is the production metrics, that's

810
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,529
when we're telling our agent

811
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:09,608
to use that pedantic model that we

812
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,719
defined and then give its

813
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:14,259
answers on that format that we are,

814
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:15,650
we are expecting.

815
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,769
So, the 3rd

816
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:23,328
session management. So, we talked about

817
00:30:23,328 --> 00:30:25,368
tools, we talked about structured

818
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:27,848
outputs, and now how we're gonna manage

819
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:30,368
the session and the memory of the agent

820
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:31,509
between interactions.

821
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,920
In this example, we are defining the session

822
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,150
the session, the local storage

823
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,769
directory.

824
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:40,489
Cleaning if it's previous.

825
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,630
We are simulating a session ID

826
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,809
in this case each operator

827
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,039
001,

828
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,608
We instance the file session manager.

829
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:50,769
And then

830
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,789
We can start interacting with the

831
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:55,509
agent.

832
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,789
You're an edge device diagnostic assistant

833
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,059
blah blah blah, and we're giving the

834
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,309
session manager when we're creating

835
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,430
this instance of the, the agent

836
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,750
so we know where it should be storing

837
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,269
uh session information.

838
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:15,519
We have a first interaction.

839
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:18,180
A second interaction.

840
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:20,269
And a third

841
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:21,289
interaction.

842
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,160
Requesting the summary.

843
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:29,130
We simulate a failure.

844
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:31,660
And then

845
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:34,449
Let's recover

846
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:37,328
From that error.

847
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:43,068
We have a session ID,

848
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:45,989
the total messages that we previously have,

849
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,170
where are the sessions? Where are the messages.

850
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:53,588
And we can

851
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:57,858
Start talking again.

852
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,390
Without any

853
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:01,689
data loss.

854
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,858
Continue the conversation.

855
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,779
Operation continues until after we start and

856
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:22,858
It broke.

857
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,019
Do you want all the time. Do you wanna use hero to

858
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:28,640
fix it?

859
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:30,699
I don't have internet. Oh yes.

860
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:33,939
So

861
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,670
But the idea is that the session manager here

862
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,049
you could be using a SQL database,

863
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,189
but here we're using local file storage you're

864
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:44,269
gonna be storing those messages and then you

865
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,750
can restart your conversation with

866
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,150
the with the agent.

867
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,289
The last capability is the integration.

868
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,858
Very quick, we are going to create a.

869
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,750
A SQLite database edge telemetry.

870
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:01,130
2, because it's my 2nd test.

871
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:04,680
And we are including the MCP

872
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,588
server SQL Lite

873
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,539
directly as a tool.

874
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:12,098
Here Um,

875
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:13,880
the list of tools.

876
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,029
I will run this.

877
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,068
So to the agent that we are creating with

878
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,568
strengths that MCP

879
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:25,088
server is

880
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,049
another tool.

881
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:28,588
Exactly. And now we are listing the tools

882
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:30,828
that the MCP have like read query, write

883
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:32,469
query, create table, etc.

884
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:34,848
And we can start

885
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:37,430
using those tools in a new

886
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,049
agent.

887
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,189
We simply passing the tools.

888
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:44,449
In the instance of the agent.

889
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,779
And we're creating a database.

890
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,479
The agent is using the create table, the

891
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,219
described table

892
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,549
tool. And

893
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:00,549
now we can.

894
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:02,818
Insert

895
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:05,380
each device data

896
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,239
on this SQL lite.

897
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,260
With natural language we are telling the agent

898
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,579
to insert some data.

899
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,378
And the agent

900
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,949
It's able

901
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:22,659
To write the correct queries,

902
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,929
read the queries,

903
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,478
try to

904
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:26,719
insert.

905
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:29,239
And at the end,

906
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:31,699
5 telemetry records have been successfully

907
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,438
inserted.

908
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,679
Let's query that data that we recently

909
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,030
um

910
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,119
write. We

911
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,030
have an agent, the tools,

912
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,679
we are asking the agent, show me all the telemetry

913
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,478
records

914
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,539
in the device, telemetry table.

915
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:53,800
And we use the read quality

916
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,699
to tool

917
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,398
to review every

918
00:34:57,739 --> 00:34:59,978
uh row that are

919
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,079
that are in the table.

920
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,300
Analytical query.

921
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,918
We're asking with natural language to calculate

922
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:15,010
the average value for each device ID

923
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,860
in the device elementary table.

924
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,260
So if I don't remember what's the SQL

925
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,280
query to get the average of

926
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,398
something, 2 years ago I wrote my

927
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:25,500
last query line code.

928
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,800
So the MCP server

929
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,309
was capable to read the

930
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:34,489
structure of the table,

931
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,070
create the specific

932
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,378
uh query that we need to run to accomplish the

933
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:39,918
task, and that's all

934
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:41,800
we have the results.

935
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,059
Ready to use.

936
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,260
This Jupiter notebook is available in our

937
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,639
GitHub repo, but

938
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,780
we also have in the GitHub repo.

939
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,918
Our edge operator agent,

940
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,199
so that was the demo for learning purposes.

941
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,820
Now we have, uh,

942
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,579
another demo that's more interactive.

943
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:08,369
Oh, it's using my same session so it's

944
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,659
recovering the data from the last session.

945
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,188
OK, at least here we're able to show the session

946
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:15,039
management in in action.

947
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:17,228
So

948
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,458
I will ask

949
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,639
I opened a new session ID

950
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:24,719
check this.

951
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,869
So I can start a new conversation.

952
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,789
So the agent answered me that the

953
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:33,989
temperature sensor

954
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,148
value is 426 °C

955
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,050
and the time that was recorded was actually

956
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,250
now. So

957
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,750
we can. Ask about

958
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:47,809
Some other.

959
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,019
The state

960
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,119
Let's close

961
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:56,438
some valves.

962
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:02,128
And in the back.

963
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,938
This agent

964
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:11,840
It's, it's calling tools basically.

965
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,019
But on the front end

966
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:16,489
we are interacting with

967
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:18,760
a natural language.

968
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:21,898
What else we have?

969
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:30,208
Perfect. The humidity sensor.

970
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,938
So we are running locally

971
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:34,519
with Olama, but let's check.

972
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,728
Perfect, we recovered the the the Internet.

973
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:39,250
What happens if we

974
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:40,909
open a new session

975
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,668
or no, the same session?

976
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,789
Only New check,

977
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,958
we're going to start working with cloth.

978
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,969
And now we are talking with Bertrag.

979
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:03,030
So notice the the latency.

980
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,030
It's very different

981
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,929
than the local ulama capabilities.

982
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,000
So let's

983
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,139
ask again.

984
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:14,639
Which

985
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,728
devices.

986
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,349
You have.

987
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,208
So it has access to exactly the

988
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,309
same tools. It's the same agent

989
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,489
with a different model.

990
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,969
Before we were running it locally on the VS

991
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:36,349
computer and now we are running a

992
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,369
remote agent uh through through

993
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,449
Bedrock in the cloud.

994
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,639
And basically it's a single

995
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,208
uh change of line. So

996
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,699
instead of uh calling uh the Olama

997
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,898
model we are calling the default

998
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:51,139
er bedrock agenter

999
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,139
LLM. So

1000
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,418
This is the demo that we have for for

1001
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,228
attendees,

1002
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,128
but.

1003
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:01,750
We have for you

1004
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,668
This repository

1005
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:06,250
not only the Jupiter notebook

1006
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,429
but the but the full

1007
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:10,449
streamlet UI and the agent

1008
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,329
running on on the edge.

1009
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,769
So

1010
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,769
what else Anna?

1011
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,030
I think it's

1012
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,469
since some of you don't know Kiro, I think

1013
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:23,590
it's a good opportunity to give a brief

1014
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,789
overview of Kiro for sure if you feel

1015
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:27,889
comfortable doing that 100%.

1016
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,878
He don't have to to have the capability

1017
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:32,340
of accomplished that.

1018
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:35,449
So

1019
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,719
Are we in the demo?

1020
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,039
I think one of the first things that we

1021
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,300
wanna talk to you about,

1022
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,760
um, usually when there's less Zoom

1023
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,978
you can see a little ghost here that's hero.

1024
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:51,110
And same as we're using some of you might be

1025
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,280
using MCP servers

1026
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,309
with cloud desktop or

1027
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,708
you're coding agents,

1028
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,539
we can connect at different MCP servers

1029
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:00,570
to to hero

1030
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,188
and there's an MCP server for

1031
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:03,750
strengths.

1032
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,188
So usually we have this problem when a

1033
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,628
library is too new or

1034
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,668
when it has constant updates

1035
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:12,708
if we talk to the models that have a cutoff

1036
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:13,648
date on their training.

1037
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,059
They're not gonna give us

1038
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,239
up to date or accurate coding

1039
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,628
recommendations for the library,

1040
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,320
so the strands agents MCP

1041
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,800
server really helped us in this 100%.

1042
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:26,989
In fact, without this strand agents

1043
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:27,719
MCP server,

1044
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,039
Quiro will be unable to accomplish the

1045
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,438
task. Yes, so most likely

1046
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:35,059
when the model that Kiro's using was trained,

1047
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,550
there wasn't strengths SDK information available.

1048
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,378
So highly recommend you to use it.

1049
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,715
You can enable and disable them so the

1050
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:45,833
model knows better what to do and not to do,

1051
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:48,204
and you can just ask questions about the,

1052
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:50,554
the strengths documentations for sure and not

1053
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:52,773
only for strength documentation, but for AWS

1054
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,235
AWS have more than 40 MCP

1055
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:57,293
servers. One of my favorite,

1056
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,094
it's the AWS documentation MCP.

1057
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:00,773
So basically we have

1058
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:03,135
the 100%

1059
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:04,094
docs

1060
00:41:04,514 --> 00:41:06,675
available in our LLM Agentic

1061
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:07,655
uh ID.

1062
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,250
So we don't need to review the documentation

1063
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,610
because really it's up to date. It's query

1064
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,570
the the real time documentation.

1065
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,090
And I don't know if you use steering here,

1066
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:20,289
but steering docs we can create a steering

1067
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:22,949
dock just telling Kiro whenever you're creating

1068
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:25,188
strengths code, please check the

1069
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:27,648
up to-date documentation on strengths

1070
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:29,139
using the MCP server.

1071
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:31,590
So it's instructions that the agents

1072
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,610
are going to use whenever we

1073
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,719
make a request. It's

1074
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:37,809
directing Kiro on what to do.

1075
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,329
I have here some.

1076
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,110
Uh, steering

1077
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,610
This was for the road to bring the hackathon.

1078
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,610
So basically I prepare three different

1079
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,110
steerings to define

1080
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,128
what uh we are going to do,

1081
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,530
what kind of technology, the structure of

1082
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,269
the,

1083
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:56,800
um,

1084
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:58,530
my whole project,

1085
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:01,188
the technology that I want to use in this case

1086
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:03,849
I opt to use strand agents, of

1087
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:06,570
course, strand tools, agent SOPs,

1088
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:07,610
the MCP

1089
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:08,869
SDKs.

1090
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,449
And all the AWS services that I try,

1091
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,570
I, I'll try to, to use on

1092
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,889
that project. So similar as

1093
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:19,289
we were saying that our agents in the edge

1094
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,728
need session management and memory.

1095
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,889
This is the way of giving memory to your

1096
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,889
coding assistant so it knows what your project

1097
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:27,889
is about, the folder structure

1098
00:42:27,889 --> 00:42:29,829
that you're using, the technologies.

1099
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,219
So just wanted to give them that quick uh

1100
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:34,780
hero intro

1101
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:37,199
since some of them didn't know and really really

1102
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,418
powerful agent hooks another capability.

1103
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:42,239
I always for every change that Quiro

1104
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,260
uh creates

1105
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,139
I am commit creating a commit automatically

1106
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:49,300
because Quiro handle all these uh capabilities

1107
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:50,780
that creates a kid commit,

1108
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,340
uh, in every

1109
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,519
uh in every task that Quiro

1110
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,179
a complete.

1111
00:42:58,728 --> 00:42:59,918
So I think.

1112
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:03,769
We can return to our

1113
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:07,869
Session here.

1114
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:09,869
And as a wrap up,

1115
00:43:13,418 --> 00:43:15,878
Download the uh ripple.

1116
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,969
Check the ripple if you have

1117
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:21,378
ideas, if you have uh some

1118
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:23,878
uh challenges that you are facing. Contact

1119
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:25,639
us. We are more than happy to help you.

1120
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,219
We are more than happy to, uh,

1121
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:30,478
describe these challenges for you and help

1122
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:31,739
to, uh,

1123
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:33,699
find the best way

1124
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,199
to create agents not only in

1125
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:36,800
the edge

1126
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,199
for, uh, uh, but in the cloud

1127
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,648
too. So

1128
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:44,708
Don't wait for your cloud

1129
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:45,978
to think, but

1130
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,550
