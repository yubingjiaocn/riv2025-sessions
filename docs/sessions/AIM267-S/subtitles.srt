1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,315
- My name's Shibani Ahuja.

2
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:02,148
I'm gonna say a couple word,

3
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:05,130
I'll share a few slides now
that they're working, excellent.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,770
And then I'd love to introduce
a friend of mine, Sameer,

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,290
but I'd like to make fun
of him before we start.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,540
The last time he and I
were on stage together

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,410
I was in four-inch stilettos
and like an evening gown,

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,600
and he was dressed like a scrub.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,770
So he's giving me a hard time

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
that I dressed for my audience.

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,750
I came prepared, I've worn
my Big Data Energy hat.

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,078
Next time, Sameer, know
your audience, okay?

13
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:29,730
(Sameer laughing)

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,900
- So, I'm Shibani Ahuja.

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,834
I have been at Salesforce for one year.

16
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:36,660
November 18th marked my
one-year anniversary.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,150
Before being at Salesforce,
I was sitting in your seat.

18
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,160
So I worked at TD Bank,

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,470
it's one of the largest banks in Canada.

20
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,910
I headed up their digital
banking for a little while,

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,200
and I ran a number of their
technologies across the globe.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,930
And how I ended up in the role that I'm in

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,960
is Salesforce loves to tell
customer success stories.

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,000
So they invited me to
an internal conference

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,830
of just their employees

26
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,190
in a room for about 450 people.

27
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,260
Mark Benioff was sitting where you are,

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,840
and they're asking me about
the personalization at scale

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,160
and all these things that we did.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,860
At the end, he asked me one
question, "What advice,"

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,157
you know, Mark Benioff
is sitting right here,

32
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:16,890
"What advice do you have for the company?"

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,930
And I let it rip.

34
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,790
Like I made it stand up comedy.

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,140
I was on a roll

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,390
that I couldn't even stop
making fun of the company.

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,957
And I would say things like, you know,

38
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:27,277
"It's ironic that you're helping me

39
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:28,717
"put my customer at the center,

40
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:30,607
"yet when I show up
for a meeting with you,

41
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,160
"22 of you show up."

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,780
And I just went on, and on and on.

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,360
Next thing you know, I'm sure
I'm gonna get kicked out,

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,300
and the next thing you
know, as I'm walking out,

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,090
someone says, "Watch out,
they're coming for you."

46
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,180
And so now, I am on the Salesforce side,

47
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,990
and I have one of the coolest
jobs where I ultimately,

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm helping the company build
out, our go to market strategy

49
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,930
for how we engage CIOs, in
the office of the CIO and CEOs

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,890
and CFOs and COOs.

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,870
So all the C-Suite,

52
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,760
what that translates into is I actually

53
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,870
get to just travel the world,

54
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,040
and I meet with enterprise
CIOs of all industries,

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
all shapes and sizes.

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,220
I just got my latest count,

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,960
I've hit now four, 520 CIOs
in the course of a year.

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,490
And these are meaningful engagements.

59
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,540
Why I share this

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,210
is because it comes into a
couple of the trends and patterns

61
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,150
that I've observed as it
relates to this little thing

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,433
called AI over the course of the year.

63
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,250
Before I get into sharing any of those,

64
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,800
I have been obligated by my legal team

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,060
to share a love letter with you.

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,160
So this is the love
letter for my legal team

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,067
to say, "Please make
any purchasing decisions

68
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,677
"that you are going to make

69
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,717
"on generally available products today,

70
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:41,340
"not of anything that you might
see that's future looking."

71
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,340
So, 520 CIOs, I've gone through
and seen a lot of trends.

72
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,350
One of which is the fact

73
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,100
that AI has become the
smallest, biggest word.

74
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,010
It's become the fastest growing thing

75
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,390
that everyone needs to implement,

76
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,670
they have to rush to get
something into production.

77
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,950
And CIOs are in a hot seat right now

78
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,860
where unlike cloud, or mobile or internet,

79
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,600
where they were squarely
in the driver's seat

80
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,470
and they were doing it,

81
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,720
like implementing it on
behalf of their organizations,

82
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,300
Suddenly everyone with Chat
GPT has become an expert at AI.

83
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,970
Boards are putting pressure,
CEOs are putting pressure,

84
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,980
everyone is putting all
this pressure on CIOs

85
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,020
to get something implemented.

86
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,130
And what's happened is,

87
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,050
in the early stages of the
year, CIOs were, you know,

88
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,000
Salesforce as an
organization would come in

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,147
and you would see these CIOs would say,

90
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,530
"No, no, no, I'm a build
shop, I'm gonna build my own."

91
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,600
And why I say AI is the
smallest, biggest word

92
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,730
is because I was starting
to learn the differences

93
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,073
between predictive, versus generative,

94
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,980
versus agentic architecture.

95
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,127
But these CIOs would just say,

96
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,800
"No, no, I'm gonna build my own."

97
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,187
And it would surprise me to say, like,

98
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,137
"You really wanna build
the component parts

99
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:48,247
"for agentic architecture?

100
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:51,067
"And do you actually
fundamentally understand

101
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,497
"what agentic AI is?

102
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:56,137
"What the difference between a copilot

103
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,440
"or generative and agentic?"

104
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,020
And so it was adamantly this conversation,

105
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,580
I'm gonna, it's build versus buy.

106
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,603
I'm gonna DIY.

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,020
I think as CIOs started to,

108
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,760
and tech leaders started to understand,

109
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,320
no, there is actually a
fundamental difference

110
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,590
between generative, and
generative and agentic,

111
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,900
then the conversation shifted again.

112
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,050
And the conversation started
to shift a bit more to,

113
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,790
Well, maybe not build versus buy,

114
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,760
but I'm gonna start to
look at maybe platforms

115
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,400
like a SaaS platform that's gonna allow me

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
to move with speed.

117
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,580
And they're gonna, they're
gonna have templates

118
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,630
and I can do it really quickly.

119
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,130
And you know, a lot of
my like customer data

120
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,650
is already within Salesforce,
so let me leverage that

121
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,350
because it seems to be a
good smart place to be.

122
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,360
There would be others that
would have a different approach

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,193
and they might say,

124
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,247
"Well, no, I'm like, I'm
not gonna look at Salesforce

125
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,850
"for AI, they're my CRM company."

126
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,683
There's others that would say,

127
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:48,157
"I'm gonna go to the Amazons of the world.

128
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,737
"I'm gonna go to AWS, I want
to cloud service provider.

129
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,987
"They're gonna give me
infinite scale and uptime,

130
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:56,797
"and I'm gonna have governance,
and protection and security.

131
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,390
"I'm gonna be able to build
my own customized agents."

132
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,180
And it was, again, I saw
the debate shifting from DIY

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,827
to not to build versus buy
to now this one to say,

134
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,640
"No, I'm gonna do a SaaS
provider and I'm gonna do."

135
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,140
There's a world where both exists.

136
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,720
And that's what we're
gonna share about today.

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,450
Is I think now the latest iteration,

138
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,770
and it's about a month-and-a-half

139
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,930
that I've started to hear
more and more of this.

140
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,000
less to build or buy.

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,430
Less, it's gonna be a SaaS platform

142
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,650
or I'm gonna use a cloud service provider.

143
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,180
Now it has shifted

144
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,362
to Agentic, native Agentic integration.

145
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,100
At TD

146
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,440
My MarTech stack alone
was 90 technologies.

147
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,990
I couldn't imagine ripping all of that out

148
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,670
and starting fresh because they,

149
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,750
I've got a 4-year-old at home,

150
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,370
so I describe a agentic architecture

151
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,030
as like the steel or the
metal in Wolverine's body.

152
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,160
I'm not, no one's gonna
architect that from scratch,

153
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,600
that's pretty tough to do.

154
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,667
And so now, I'm hearing a lot of CIOs say,

155
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:52,747
"I need to look at the partners

156
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:53,797
"that I've already invested in,

157
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:55,957
"the technologies that I
already have in my shop,

158
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,637
"And I'd like to start
looking at who is doing

159
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:01,447
"the work for me to build these
agentic native integrations

160
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,300
"such that we can move with speed."

161
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,190
And that is the better together story.

162
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,630
'Cause I think that there has been,

163
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,030
wait, Salesforce, don't
you compete with AWS

164
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,900
in certain spaces?

165
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,970
But that's not the case.

166
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,380
So I am so thrilled to
introduce Sameer from Capita,

167
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,360
who again, a friend of mine.

168
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,193
Come on up.
- Hello.

169
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,579
- Nice to see you again.

170
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,420
- We are friends, see?
- We are, we are.

171
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,220
we are legitimately friends.

172
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,140
So I can tease him.

173
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,510
And Capita has become
an agentic enterprise

174
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,630
where leveraging Salesforce
and Amazon Bedrock,

175
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,510
he is an example of how
we have come together

176
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,850
to really be able to
drive agents at scale.

177
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,347
And Sameer, when we
were prepping for this,

178
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:40,200
one of the things that
you had talked about

179
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,450
was that you've got four use cases

180
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,400
specifically that you're looking at

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,160
that are linked to both
Amazon Bedrock and Agentforce.

182
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,140
Tell us a bit about those four use cases.

183
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,070
- Yeah, first of all,

184
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,440
absolutely thrilled to
be back at Reinvent.

185
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,283
I was at AWS until exactly
this day a year ago.

186
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,013
- Oh.

187
00:06:58,013 --> 00:06:59,970
- So it's great to come
back as a customer.

188
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,820
You actually walk less, believe
it or not, as a customer.

189
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,580
So absolutely thrilled.

190
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,500
And I've seen what Salesforce
has done with AWS in the past

191
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,680
from the inside, and now I see
it from the outside as well.

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,960
And so when I took on this new role

193
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,740
to introduce agentic
workflows into Capita,

194
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,720
there was a lot of noise
about which platform to use.

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,210
Who do we engage with?
Do we go with an SI?

196
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,880
And there were these,
and the fundamental thing

197
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,757
that Jeff Bezos actually said was,

198
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,157
"In times of uncertainty,

199
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:38,727
"build on something that doesn't change."

200
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,623
And I know what won't
change, AWS will be here.

201
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,140
Salesforce will be here.

202
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,973
- Yeah.

203
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:49,050
- And so when I looked at
what we needed to build

204
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,570
across the multiple use cases we have,

205
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,910
and we run everything
from transport for London

206
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,193
to training nuclear submarine operators.

207
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
My biggest need was to
democratize the ability

208
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,060
to build agents across
all of my organization.

209
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,440
And so we looked at four different
use cases to get started.

210
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,940
The first one is we had,
as Shibani mentioned,

211
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,480
she said, 90, I have a customer
who's about 65 right now,

212
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,803
different applications.

213
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,340
And you create the rip and replace

214
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,450
or you could go over the top with MuleSoft

215
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,780
and create that cover

216
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,110
and then start building agents
on top very, very easily.

217
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,453
And that's one that we use all the time.

218
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,570
And then for our contact center space,

219
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,790
the integration with Amazon Connect

220
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,400
and that exposure into Agentforce,

221
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,140
we're actually building agents,

222
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,270
voice agents in Agentforce today

223
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,290
and deploying them at scale
using both Amazon Connect,

224
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,823
Invoicecloud and Salesforce.

225
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,890
We are using Missionforce
for our defense applications.

226
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,470
We are building local government in a box.

227
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,520
And all of these that used to take years

228
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,253
and frankly tens of
millions of pounds to build,

229
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,900
we're now building in months
and deploying at scale.

230
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,980
- And, you know, for the audience

231
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,360
that may or may not be
familiar with Capita,

232
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,152
maybe give even like a brief overview of-

233
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:14,985
- Absolutely.

234
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,100
- Like what Capita is, what's
the business that you're in?

235
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,100
- So Capita is the largest
UK based public sector BPO,

236
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,590
business process outsourcer.

237
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,290
So if you really look at the
kind of services we operate,

238
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,290
we touch 70% of the UK's
population every single week.

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,130
From running civil service pensions,

240
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,053
which we went live with two days ago,

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,470
to transport for London,
which I mentioned,

242
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,470
to doing recruitment for the British Army.

243
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,090
And everywhere it is
such a diverse use case

244
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,710
that is very, very process heavy.

245
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,470
And that's ripe for electrification.

246
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,520
And that's why we're there

247
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,770
because human labor is gonna go infinite.

248
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,400
It is gonna be scalable, it
is gonna be available 24/7,

249
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,560
and that's the mission that we're after.

250
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,570
- So Sameer, here's another
connect that we have.

251
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,790
Like BPO, I used to
live in the Philippines

252
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,130
and I was setting up a captive BPO.

253
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,270
It is a human intensive
function or department.

254
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,530
Like how are you looking at,

255
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,600
we've talked a lot about
agents, human agents,

256
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,130
and digital labor coming together.

257
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,690
Like how are you looking at that strategy

258
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,750
being a very, like,
human-heavy organization?

259
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,670
What's the strategy of bringing AI

260
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,473
and your colleagues together?

261
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,450
- It, in the immortal
words of a guy called Phil,

262
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,293
just do it.

263
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,830
So there's a lot of fud in the market

264
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,340
about agentification that
it's going to take jobs,

265
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,690
reduce labor.

266
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,660
We saw exactly the opposite
when we introduced agents

267
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,600
to our customer advisors

268
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,493
who actually run that contact center.

269
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,420
If you ever been on a contact center

270
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,250
and you've been passed around
department to department,

271
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,540
we all have right?

272
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,870
For hours and hours,
you're super frustrated.

273
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,600
But guess who's more frustrated than you?

274
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,910
It's actually the customer
advisor on the other end.

275
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,440
'Cause he or she did not have the tools

276
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,390
to actually resolve your problem.

277
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,270
Once we gave our advisors those tools,

278
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,580
they actually started pulling on us

279
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,230
and giving us more use
cases for agentification.

280
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,930
And that started this virtual cycle where,

281
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,150
when we started with 10 advisors,

282
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,760
all thousand plus advisors
actually literally came to us

283
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,100
and said, "I want some of that."

284
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,030
Because they do not want to
be writing up transcripts.

285
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,780
They do not want to be marking themselves.

286
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,870
They don't want the supervisor
looking over their shoulder.

287
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,690
It's just a better life,
they're more satisfied,

288
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,740
they're happier.

289
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,600
And that's translating into
customer NPS improvements

290
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,650
for our contact centers.

291
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,940
- Yeah.

292
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,250
On that and the use cases
that you've talked about,

293
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,120
how are you measuring?

294
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,540
So measurement, true
measurement was a hot topic.

295
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,300
Last night I hosted a dinner with CIOs

296
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,580
and one of the hottest
topics that came up was, yep,

297
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,390
we're attributing a lot of benefits to AI.

298
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,120
But tracing it back was very difficult

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,120
because many organizations
didn't have that baseline.

300
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,760
How are you looking at
the measurement of AI

301
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,470
and are you telling the story?

302
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,680
- Yeah, so three different vectors really.

303
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,973
One, we run a lot of
contracts that have KPIs.

304
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,920
And when we don't execute to
those KPIs, we incur penalties.

305
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,050
But when we exceed those KPIs,

306
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,600
we share in the profits with the customer.

307
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,150
So actually looking at that KPI

308
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,750
and saying A, can we eliminate
all of these penalties?

309
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,270
We've eliminated double
digit million pounds

310
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,620
of penalties in a contract.

311
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,460
- Wow.

312
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,323
- Just by identifying the bottleneck.

313
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,860
And that drops straight
to the bottom line.

314
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,160
It's not new revenue, but it's even better

315
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,110
'cause it's a hundred
percent margin, right?

316
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,670
And we share that with the customer.

317
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,503
- Yeah.

318
00:12:57,503 --> 00:13:01,080
- And then number two, we are embedding AI

319
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,560
into every single bid
that we put out there.

320
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,763
Every single one.

321
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,890
And we are seeing a win rate increase

322
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,370
because we are cheaper, we are faster,

323
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,840
and we are more flexible

324
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,060
in what we are providing to the customer.

325
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,470
So that's number two.

326
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,720
And then number three, just for us

327
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,493
to become an agentic enterprise,

328
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:28,440
we have democratized access to

329
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,800
low-code development of agents

330
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,250
across all of our customers,
all of our employees.

331
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,140
And we're actually measuring what they,

332
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,930
what agents they've built

333
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,940
and what actions they're taking.

334
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,590
And at this point, we are attributing

335
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,390
a fiat currency to each one of them.

336
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,070
But the customer and
the employee NPS, sorry,

337
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,620
is actually a good representation

338
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,570
of how well they're actually adopting it

339
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,630
and how happy they are with
it, and it is going up.

340
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,000
- What I, so again, if I
think about the trends,

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,040
an evolution that I've
seen as it relates to AI,

342
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,330
I love what you've just called out

343
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,460
is that not one of your measurements

344
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,243
was how many FTEs are you reducing?

345
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,076
- None at all.

346
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,440
- Right? Like, this is
again, a healthy way

347
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,850
of starting to think about those use cases

348
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,710
and looking at the growth opportunities

349
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,000
or the expansion opportunities.

350
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,970
And I had actually, it was, it
was also for Capita, I think

351
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,730
that I was presenting and
speaking on your behalf,

352
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,650
saying that there was a
contact center opportunity

353
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,000
that you had a use case where

354
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,980
your contact center was open nine to five.

355
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,813
- Correct.

356
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:28,410
- And suddenly when you
implemented Agentforce

357
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,120
to help support the contact center agents

358
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,800
such that the agent could handle

359
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,840
the more, like, mundane tasks,

360
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,180
suddenly your contact center
became from nine to five,

361
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,220
became overnight, it was 24/7.

362
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,680
Because there was transactions
that could be performed,

363
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
or there was cases that could
be resolved by the agent.

364
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,300
And that's again, another
way of looking at it,

365
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,410
to say that's a reverse
benefit to your colleagues,

366
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,634
the change management around adoption.

367
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,640
- Yeah, that's a great use case.

368
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,050
And I'm going to go even further.

369
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,130
- Yeah.

370
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,040
- Historically we used to
have a customer advisor

371
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,170
dedicated to an account, because he or she

372
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,080
needed to know everything
about that account

373
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,220
and how to operate within the
constraints of that account.

374
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,743
We are now able to time
division multiplex.

375
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:15,060
These highly capable agents

376
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,830
across multiple different accounts

377
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,140
just by providing on-demand knowledge base

378
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,310
and real time assistance
using, in this case,

379
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,250
generative AI and transcription,
not necessarily an agent.

380
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,083
- Right, right.

381
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,830
- And the next step is going to be enable,

382
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,680
give them agents to enable them to do

383
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,480
first call resolution.

384
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,320
Much, much better.

385
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,660
- Wow, love it.

386
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,260
Okay, so you have a unique position here

387
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,720
in that you clearly, you know Salesforce,

388
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,130
you've got Salesforce in your ecosystem,

389
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,200
you're familiar with
it, we get you on stage,

390
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,460
you help tell the story.

391
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,760
But being only a year away from AWS

392
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,370
and working at Capita,
you know, in your words,

393
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,530
what are the benefits of
this better together story?

394
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,531
Like, do it better than me on stage.

395
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,364
(Sameer laughing)

396
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,870
- Tell the audience.

397
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,370
- Look, I'm a geek, right?

398
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,420
And this is the only suit I wear.

399
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,967
- I do have the hat, I don't think so.

400
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,550
- Yeah, okay, I would always love to go in

401
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,743
and do assembly level code.

402
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,473
- Yeah.

403
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,500
- If given a choice.

404
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,370
- Yep.

405
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,340
- But I don't want, I can't, right.

406
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,400
So, one of the things that
Salesforce has brought

407
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,400
is the elevation of
enabling everyone in my org

408
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,650
to basically go in and
describe with natural language

409
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,870
what they want to do for their customer,

410
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,310
and to test it out with their customer

411
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,210
without my involvement.

412
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,043
- Right.

413
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,990
- Or any of my team's involvement,
team sitting over there,

414
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,640
but they're enabling teams now.

415
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,010
They don't necessarily have to build

416
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,690
for the customer anymore.

417
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,030
All they do is advise and guide.

418
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,830
Yeah? They are the Yodas.

419
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,680
- Yeah.
- Right?

420
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,950
(both laughing)

421
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,783
- Love it.

422
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,890
- Right? So we have a bunch of Yodas,

423
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,990
but we have a lot of Jedi Knights now

424
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,910
is the way I'd look at it.

425
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,992
- Amazing.

426
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:02,020
- And every single one of my
employees, Capita's employees

427
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,980
is a padawan, hopefully
will become a Jedi knight.

428
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,590
- We're geeking out now.
- In the future.

429
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,450
I am, absolutely.

430
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,130
Hey, it comes out

431
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,500
- And, but I think like from
a partnership perspective,

432
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,390
the fact that you can
now purchase Salesforce

433
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,983
on the AWS Marketplace or-

434
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:18,816
- Absolutely.

435
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:19,650
- The model optionality.

436
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,020
I think, again, as a
customer, I thought Salesforce

437
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,887
was one of these big bad
wolves that say, like,

438
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:26,107
"You've gotta have
everything in Salesforce,

439
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:27,127
"you've gotta buy every module

440
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,830
"in order to get all the benefits."

441
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,580
But then to learn that it's
a interoperable open stack

442
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,110
that's allowing you to choose your models.

443
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,737
And in this case, you know, Bedrock,

444
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:38,010
being able to choose through Bedrock.

445
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,280
- Look, financially for
us, it made a lot of sense.

446
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,266
- Yeah.

447
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,170
- Because it runs on AWS,

448
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,943
allows us to retire AWS Commit.

449
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,150
It's like, it's a no brainer,
why wouldn't you do that?

450
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,470
- Yeah.

451
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,460
- Number one.

452
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,210
Number two, you are the absolute experts

453
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,980
in the Salesforce ecosystem

454
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,170
and you have tens of
thousands of use cases

455
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,580
that you're already identifying.

456
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,413
- Right.

457
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,430
- Why would we recreate that?

458
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,263
- Right.

459
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:04,170
- Why won't we use what
you've already built?

460
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,490
And it's available on
Agentforce Marketplace

461
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,880
and on the AWS Marketplace

462
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,900
and have it securely governed.

463
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,950
With what I know is the best
security platform on Earth.

464
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,450
- Fabulous.
- Is AWS.

465
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,660
- I'm gonna have to slip this
guy some money afterwards.

466
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,760
Okay, last question as we wrap it up.

467
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,720
You've got the audience here,

468
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,520
you've got a lot of folks here.

469
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,560
Three, like, three key takeaways

470
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,863
that you give to the audience
as it relates to agentic AI.

471
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,000
- First of all, build on something

472
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,940
that you know is gonna be
there for the long term.

473
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,160
You are going to get inundated

474
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,160
by everyone who's specializing
in a single use case.

475
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,880
But the beauty of agentic
AI is that you can adapt

476
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,310
to any use case as long as
you have the right platform

477
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,450
and the global reach.

478
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,621
And that's what the AWS and
Agentforce capability gives you.

479
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,678
- Right.

480
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:05,343
- You can build your own, start building.

481
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,390
No one knows the process
that you're doing,

482
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,490
the job that you're doing better than you.

483
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,343
Build for yourself,

484
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,760
then share it with your employees.

485
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,810
- Great.

486
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,310
- And look, that's it.

487
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,200
And you will see the value.

488
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,953
And then, you know, last one, have fun.

489
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,310
I literally have fun every day.

490
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm like, I had an SI come
in the other day saying,

491
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,140
I'm gonna charge you 2
million pounds to do this.

492
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,960
I went and wipe cutted it on Salesforce.

493
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,100
- Yep.

494
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,600
- And, I showed it to the SI
in like half an hour, right?

495
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,870
This world is changing, start building.

496
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,580
- Perfect.
- If I can build, so can you.

497
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,920
- So have fun, here's
a few ways to have fun.

498
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Come visit us, you can
build agents at our booth.

499
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,870
Come check this out, learn
more about the partnership

500
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,250
between Salesforce and AWS.

501
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,770
If this is part of your
stack, learn much more.

502
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,050
Contact your account
reps if you have a rep.

503
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,050
If not, come talk to us
if you're interested,

504
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,160
you know, don't know what Salesforce is,

505
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,570
happy to talk about that.

506
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,550
And it's a pleasure, thank you.

507
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,810
Thank you, Sameer.

508
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,980
Love it.

509
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,400
I will hopefully see
you again on the stage.

510
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,233
- See you soon.

511
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,066
- But thank you all for coming.

512
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,240
(audience applauding)

513
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,380
- [Sameer] Kiss me, thank you so much.
