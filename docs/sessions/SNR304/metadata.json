  "abstract": "Traditional software development often resembles a manufacturing assembly line, where code passes from one developer to the next, creating idle time and fragmented documentation that fails to meet modern compliance demands. Modern application development offers a better way to simultaneously enhance productivity and satisfy regulatory requirements. Through integrated tooling and practices—including Git version control and automated testing—organizations can maximize developer productivity while naturally producing documentary proof that serves as compliance evidence. This session features real-world examples from leaders who have successfully leveraged these practices to meet critical compliance standards (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ISO 13485, GMP Annex 11). ",
  "abstract_cn": "传统软件开发往往类似于制造业流水线，代码从一个开发人员传递到下一个，造成空闲时间和碎片化文档，无法满足现代合规要求。现代应用程序开发提供了一种更好的方式，可以同时提高生产力并满足监管要求。通过集成工具和实践——包括Git版本控制和自动化测试——组织可以最大化开发人员生产力，同时自然产生可作为合规证据的文档证明。本次会议展示了成功利用这些实践满足关键合规标准（FDA 21 CFR Part 11、ISO 13485、GMP Annex 11）的领导者的真实案例。",
