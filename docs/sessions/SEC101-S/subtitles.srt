1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,430
- Hi, good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,585
My name is a Afeef Ahmed,

3
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:06,645
and I'm on stage here
today with Bipin Nepani

4
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:07,950
and Venky Krishnan.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,540
- Hi everyone.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,370
- Today we're gonna be
talking about WhatsApp,

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,580
about how to scale customer
engagement on WhatsApp.

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,810
So I'm gonna be starting off today

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,000
and then I'm gonna be passing
off to these two gentlemen

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,250
who will be going
through some more of the,

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,350
about our integration with AWS

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,240
and about how you guys
can actually get started

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,490
with WhatsApp business.

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,810
- Alright, cool.
- Sounds good.

15
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,070
- See you in a minute.
- We'll see you guys

16
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,183
in a few minutes here.

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,070
So, business messaging is
all about communication,

18
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,710
and communication between a customer

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,790
and a business is nothing new,

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,330
that's been going on for, you
know, since all of history.

21
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,570
Once upon a time that was just
face-to-face communication,

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,690
and then over time there
became mail and phone,

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,820
and websites and apps.

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,440
I can actually think of
this exact same example

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,240
with my hairstylist.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,640
Once upon a time I had to call
them to make an appointment,

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,980
then they finally made a
website, not a great one,

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,870
but I can make appointments there.

29
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,850
They skipped the app section

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,170
but now I actually communicate

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,970
with my hairstylist over WhatsApp.

32
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,440
I make my appointments there,

33
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,050
I can see how long it was
since my last appointment was

34
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,510
so I can tell them, you know,
cut a lot of hair or not.

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,050
I can see in one persistent thread

36
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,570
if I'd liked or did not
like a previous haircut

37
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,770
with a picture, so it gives me kind of

38
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,270
a rich way to interact with the business

39
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,100
and for the business to interact with me

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,590
because of that persistent thread.

41
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,940
So business messaging,
you know, which is that,

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,980
the era of communication that we're in,

43
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,360
it really just enriches

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,370
all of the previous methods that we had,

45
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,230
largely because of that persistent thread,

46
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,760
and that's gonna be something

47
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,683
that we talk about a lot today.

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,540
You got, I mean, the fact that
you guys joined the session,

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,570
probably, you know that what WhatsApp is,

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,540
has a dominant position
all around the world.

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,880
Three billion monthly active users,

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,800
600 million conversations

53
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,220
between customers and
businesses every single day,

54
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,130
and even in the US we
have over a 100 million

55
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,360
monthly active users,

56
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,100
and that number is rapidly growing,

57
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,350
actually much faster than in
much of the rest of the world

58
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,870
where WhatsApp already has primacy

59
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,220
as a communication channel.

60
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,220
And so why are these numbers important?

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,930
It's because if you are a business

62
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,810
who wants to get in touch
with your customers,

63
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,600
you want to use the channel
that they're already using.

64
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,610
That's the way that you're
going to get high read rates,

65
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,590
that's the way you're
going to get interaction,

66
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,490
that's the way you're gonna
get customers to interact with

67
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,923
and perhaps transact with your business.

68
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,800
So for a business
considering or thinking about

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,190
how they can get in touch with a customer,

70
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,260
we've put this flywheel up here

71
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,940
and it has a lot of words
that actually remind me

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,880
of my marketing class
from business school.

73
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,840
But you can see from
awareness through discovery,

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,433
consideration, purchase,
post-purchase, and re-engagement,

75
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,840
all of those sections of
the customer lifecycle

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
you can kind of think of
broadly as how you do marketing,

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,440
how you do sales, how you
do follow up with customers.

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,480
And really WhatsApp
facilitates communication

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,303
for any of those elements
of the customer journey.

80
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,887
Not only does WhatsApp
facilitate those elements

81
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,750
for kind of marketing or sales use cases,

82
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,600
but it really facilitates use cases,

83
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,980
other kinds of use cases that,

84
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,690
where a business would want to get

85
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,580
in touch with the customer.

86
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,640
A few come to mind,
authentication messages,

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,460
you can think of these
as one-time passcodes,

88
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,460
utility messages, this is
not necessarily to derive

89
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,650
a sale or anything, but
it might be a message that

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,970
you have an appointment coming up

91
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,030
or that your package is about to arrive.

92
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,310
Those kinds of, and also,
oh, I forgot to mention,

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,510
customer service messages

94
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,890
where you might want to get in touch

95
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,060
with a business yourself

96
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,170
and ask a question about when
something is going to arrive.

97
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,920
All of these different
types of communication

98
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
lead to kind of

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,210
a business being able to
serve the entire journey

100
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,570
of how a customer would
want to interact with you.

101
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,660
And notably, you know, I think,

102
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,980
some marketers may think,

103
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,280
well, why do I necessarily
care about one-time passcodes

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,600
or utility messages, right,

105
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,220
I care about marketing messages

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,810
and saying those to customers.

107
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,300
But what we've actually
seen through our businesses

108
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,760
that use WhatsApp is that

109
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,120
for businesses that employ
multiple types of messages,

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,730
that send utility messages
and marketing messages,

111
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,800
they then actually get higher read rates,

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,410
higher action rates when
they send marketing messages.

113
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,286
Because as I mentioned
in the example with the,

114
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,040
you know, with my hairstylist,

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
there is one persistent thread

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,850
and that notion of a persistent thread

117
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,530
builds trust with the customer.

118
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,690
Once trust with the
customer is established,

119
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,210
then they are likely to look at,

120
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,273
or consider whatever it is that
you're sending over to them.

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,633
WhatsApp has, as you can see, a pretty,

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,520
the metrics look great, it's
a really engaging platform,

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,460
you know, 80% read rate, a click-through,

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,260
or sorry, a click rate of 50%

125
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,590
and a conversion rate of 30%.

126
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,730
The conversion rate, I should note,

127
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,470
is actually sort of a
customer action rate,

128
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,520
so that could be, you know,

129
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,350
a conversion could be any number of things

130
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,100
of whatever a business is
wanting a customer to do.

131
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,020
And because WhatsApp has this
really deep engaging platform,

132
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,750
it's a compelling solution for businesses

133
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,950
to try to get in touch
with their customers.

134
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,280
Now, if you're a business
that's thinking about WhatsApp,

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,300
of course data privacy and
security are gonna be paramount,

136
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,620
and they should be.

137
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,020
Those are things that the
product teams that I work with,

138
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,840
they're also constantly thinking about.

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,200
You may know, especially if
you're a consumer of WhatsApp,

140
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,080
that we have end-to-end
encryption on messages.

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,060
But what you may not know
is that we actually build in

142
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,820
a lot of redundancy through
our security protocols

143
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,290
and our security procedures

144
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,606
to ensure the utmost level of privacy

145
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:03,184
for the messages being sent over WhatsApp,

146
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,160
between a business and between a client

147
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,480
or just between customers

148
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,273
for the consumer version
of WhatsApp as well.

149
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,370
Now, of course, we couldn't
be at re:Invent 2025

150
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,710
and not mention AI at all,

151
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,070
but WhatsApp is really an ideal channel

152
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,490
for AI-enabled conversations.

153
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,320
And I'd say there's three reasons why

154
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,270
that are illuminated on this slide here,

155
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,130
one is the widespread usage.

156
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,690
You saw this on an earlier slide,

157
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,510
but with three billion
monthly active users,

158
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,430
this is the way that you as a business

159
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,670
can get in touch with
your customers at scale.

160
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,560
The second is, there are rich features.

161
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,270
So again, if you're a user of WhatsApp,

162
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,800
you may have seen some of these like

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,060
click-to-action buttons,

164
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,060
or you may have seen a PDF that
was attached by a business,

165
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,010
these are the kinds of rich features that

166
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,930
an AI agent on WhatsApp
could also utilize.

167
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,270
And finally, we have a
rich partner ecosystem.

168
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,530
There are many partners today

169
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,200
that are already using
AI agents on WhatsApp,

170
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,060
and this is the way if, you know,

171
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,370
if you're a business that's
following that flywheel

172
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,980
I showed on the previous
slide of the multiple ways

173
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,020
in which a business can get
in touch with a customer,

174
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,610
you need to be able to do that at scale

175
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,260
and an AI agent would be a
way to be able to do that.

176
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,200
So now I want to talk a little bit about

177
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,140
the different kinds of messages
that WhatsApp facilitates.

178
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,310
And again, this is really important

179
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,750
'cause as I mentioned before,

180
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,830
the more variety of message
types that a business employs

181
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,730
with getting in touch with a customer,

182
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,990
the more that relationship
is formed with the customer

183
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,790
and the more they're
likely to take action,

184
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,920
including with marketing messages.

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,390
But lemme start from the left there.

186
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,220
So on the left you see service messages,

187
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,380
these ones are user initiated messages.

188
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,610
So I gave the example before

189
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,530
where you might get in touch and say,

190
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,840
Hey, you know, I need to rebook my flight

191
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,020
or my package didn't arrive.

192
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,600
Then the three message types at the right

193
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,984
are all business initiated

194
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:58,560
or are all business
initiated conversations.

195
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,290
So that second one is
utility conversations.

196
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,110
Utility conversations are
transactional messages.

197
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,140
So you could think of these
as, your package has arrived,

198
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,603
or you have an appointment
coming up tomorrow.

199
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,440
Moving on from that, you'll
see marketing messages.

200
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,900
Marketing messages is, you know,

201
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,250
it's kind of the bread and butter of,

202
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,135
you know, Meta given that
we were an ads business

203
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,780
and are, you know, are
moving on from that,

204
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,590
but marketing messages are
kind of any kind of a promotion

205
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,740
or an offer that would
be served to a customer.

206
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,670
And finally the last one
is authentication messages.

207
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,830
Authentication messages,
as I mentioned before,

208
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,910
are one-time passcodes,

209
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,830
but those one-time passcodes can serve

210
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,423
a number of use cases.

211
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,900
So now we're gonna do a bit of a deep dive

212
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,320
into each one of those business
initiated conversation types

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,333
that I mentioned before.

214
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,410
First, utility messages.

215
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,980
So utility messages can
serve multiple cases,

216
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,310
they can be for order management,

217
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,380
they can be for payment alerts,

218
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,260
for appointment reminders or fraud alerts.

219
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,030
And as you can see from the images here

220
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,340
with this kind of like the,

221
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,390
you know, the rich imaging,

222
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,210
the ability to have
attachments within the thread,

223
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,730
it's a way for a customer
to be really engaged with

224
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,530
and to develop trust in you

225
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,330
as a business interacting with them.

226
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,230
Here's a comparison specifically
for utility messages

227
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,990
of WhatsApp against other
communication channels,

228
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,393
notably RCS and SMS.

229
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,770
I think, a couple things
to highlight here is that,

230
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,320
WhatsApp supports rich media,

231
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,350
with the longer care, it
has longer character counts

232
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,390
and the end-to-end encryption

233
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,643
that is fundamental to WhatsApp.

234
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,990
Now let's move on to marketing messages.

235
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,120
So before we kind of go into that

236
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,180
deep detail of what marketing,

237
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,370
of how marketing messages work,

238
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,903
what are marketing messages,

239
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,530
they're the way in which a
business can get in touch with

240
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,500
and you know, develop a
rapport with a customer.

241
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,140
Notably, that customer
needs to be opted in.

242
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,670
So this is a little bit different from ads

243
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,890
where, you know, a customer
does not have to consent

244
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,000
to be served an ad,

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,430
but for a marketing message
they do have to consent.

246
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,650
And because they have to
consent, you can imagine

247
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,110
that there is a high
likelihood that that customer

248
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,660
will want to interact with
the marketing message,

249
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,970
be it a promotion, be it a sale,

250
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,030
be it abandoned a shopping cart message

251
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,880
that you would send to that customer.

252
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,990
Now, previously the marketing messages

253
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,533
that were sent over WhatsApp

254
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,640
were just kind of blunt
templated marketing messages

255
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,230
that were sent to a customer.

256
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,353
And you know, if a certain
number of messages were sent,

257
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,680
then our API might say, okay,

258
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,450
don't send any more
messages to that customer

259
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,730
they've already received too many today.

260
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,920
What it did not take into account however,

261
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,050
was the likelihood that that customer

262
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,880
may want to interact with the message.

263
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,970
And so now we've actually
very recently introduced

264
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,520
optimizations in our marketing messages.

265
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,040
These are the same kinds
of optimizations that,

266
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,410
you know, we have for
our ads engine as well.

267
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,790
And so what's happening here

268
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,860
is we're actually taking
into consideration

269
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,800
the likelihood that
you will open a message

270
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,950
or read that message

271
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,630
at the specific time that that
message would be sent to you.

272
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,770
And so a decision is made

273
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,570
whether to send that
message to that person

274
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,830
or to send it to somebody else

275
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,420
who has a higher likelihood

276
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,240
of actually looking at
that marketing message.

277
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,580
And we've seen some, although
this is a pretty new feature,

278
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,583
we've seen promising results.

279
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,270
There was a study done in India

280
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,330
and you know, for those of you
who've spent time in India,

281
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,250
it's actually very common
to send marketing messages

282
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,540
over WhatsApp there.

283
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,170
And we've seen up to a
9% higher delivery rate

284
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,430
of those marketing messages.

285
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,230
And again, there's a higher delivery rate

286
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,810
because we're not hitting
that blunt cap of,

287
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,450
hey, too many messages sent,
don't send it to that person.

288
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,030
Instead we're sending the
messages in the first place

289
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,380
to the individuals that we think

290
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,280
will interact with that message
and would want to read it.

291
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,580
Now the next message
type that I'll talk about

292
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,123
are authentication messages.

293
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,430
Authentication messages could
serve multiple use cases,

294
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,820
they're all one-time
passcode type messages,

295
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,050
but those one-time passcodes

296
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,700
could serve different use cases.

297
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,280
You could think of new account creation,

298
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,203
you can think of account recovery,

299
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,360
new transactions, or even
for an existing transaction.

300
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,270
You know, actually I was in the UK before

301
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,970
and for my orders that came via Deliveroo,

302
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,130
actually the WhatsApp code came,

303
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,030
or sorry, the one-time passcode
came via WhatsApp as well.

304
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,870
So here again is a comparison of

305
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,040
WhatsApp versus RCS and SMS

306
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,830
specifically for authentication messages.

307
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,160
with WhatsApp you're able
to have that single thread,

308
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,570
you can do copy and code

309
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,710
and there's autofill features

310
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,650
which are really helpful
for one-time passcodes.

311
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,110
There's no app switching necessary.

312
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,570
And you know, true to what WhatsApp is,

313
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,190
there's very low latency

314
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,710
and high reliability in
those messages being sent,

315
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,961
which if you're sending
a one-time passcode

316
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,760
or a utility message,

317
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,478
it's really important that those messages

318
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:18,090
arrive to your customer

319
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,440
and arrive to your customer at the time

320
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,240
that you intend to send them to 'em.

321
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,700
Now, I've talked to
you a quite a bit about

322
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,560
what WhatsApp is and the
different kind of message types

323
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,270
we have in native
integration with AWS as well.

324
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,940
And so for those of you that
are existing AWS customers,

325
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,500
it's very easy to get set up

326
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,007
and Venky is going to come up here

327
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:41,580
and talk about AWS End User Messaging,

328
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,033
which is the service that
WhatsApp is integrated with.

329
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
- So as a show of hands,

330
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,630
how many of you are familiar with

331
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,113
AWS end user messaging at all?

332
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,990
Alright, so I see a few hands up there.

333
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,973
So just to let you know,

334
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,040
there are two major
communications services APIs

335
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,443
that are available on AWS today.

336
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,460
One is called as Amazon
Simple Email Service,

337
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,490
and the other one is
AWS End User Messaging.

338
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,490
And AWS End User Messaging
is predominantly used for

339
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,430
multi-channel communications across SMS,

340
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,790
push notifications, and now WhatsApp.

341
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,580
The biggest advantage of that is that

342
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,050
it actually provides a
way for you to actually

343
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,320
take applications that you build on AWS,

344
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,210
and allows you to actually use these APIs

345
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,150
to actually build native integration.

346
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,690
So using a single API stack

347
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,270
along with your application code bases

348
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,500
that you're building in

349
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,410
and leveraging the rest
of the AWS services,

350
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,140
you're now able to deliver messaging.

351
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,550
And one of the reasons

352
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,070
we actually extended this for WhatsApp is

353
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,920
really from an ask from
our customers around,

354
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,830
hey, this is another major channel

355
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,810
of communications that we have.

356
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,470
So customers of all types are looking at

357
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,130
three different ways of
considering messaging,

358
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,010
one is, do I have a dedicated cohort

359
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,893
that I can actually reach
on one particular channel?

360
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,510
More importantly, am I able to deliver

361
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,660
the kind of fidelity that
I need in my messaging,

362
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,500
which is, am I able to
deliver rich communications?

363
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,270
And more importantly for
many parts of the globe,

364
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,490
how's the best way to
actually reach customers

365
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,790
as I need them in different
markets around the world?

366
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,510
So that's one of the
reasons we actually put

367
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,343
AWS end user messaging out there.

368
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,833
Why is this is relevant
for WhatsApp is that,

369
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,640
in your application stack itself,

370
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,100
you now have the ability to manage

371
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,250
various types of interactions
that make it rich,

372
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,670
but at the same time you now have

373
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,760
the ability to actually
drive that reach across.

374
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,000
So using a single WhatsApp number,

375
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,253
I can reach customers all over the globe.

376
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,630
I have that kind of capability,

377
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,590
whereas with SMS I have
to provision things like

378
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,200
SMS long codes and short codes

379
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,260
that actually take time to
provision in many markets.

380
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,690
So that actually is a big reason

381
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,390
why WhatsApp becomes a very big channel.

382
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,410
The other thing is that

383
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,060
I have various types of
restrictions on channels like SMS,

384
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,970
I can send only certain types of content

385
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,530
on certain types of numbers.

386
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,590
WhatsApp gives me this high fidelity

387
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,540
that I can take, as Afeef pointed out,

388
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,090
various types of messages.

389
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,090
So that gives me a single
threaded conversation view

390
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,510
that I can actually take

391
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,597
and actually take those encrypted
communications end-to-end,

392
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,070
and actually feed them

393
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,000
into the rest of my customer
service capabilities.

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,750
So now I can actually do certain
interesting stuff with us

395
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,600
that gives me forward thinking capability

396
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,113
and future proof my customer
engagement strategy.

397
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,060
One of the other advantages
of doing these things

398
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,950
is the fact that I'm able to leverage

399
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,370
the same IM security policies that I need.

400
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,530
I'm able to take advantage

401
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,530
of whatever application API
security policies that I've set

402
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,190
and those are now gonna be applied

403
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,710
for my messaging infrastructure

404
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,720
and my messaging capabilities.

405
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,170
And I'm able to take those
deliverability metrics

406
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,990
that are coming across
these channels like WhatsApp

407
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,440
and actually feed them into
a single infrastructure

408
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,190
for me to be able to react to them.

409
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,500
I dunno if I just go to the next slide.

410
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,360
So what does that mean, right?

411
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,560
So we have right now today
a lot of capabilities

412
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,950
that we have built with
open source out there

413
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,014
that you can actually take on GitHub,

414
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:12,240
where you can actually take conversations

415
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,040
and extend those conversations

416
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,000
where I can create
Agentic AI capabilities.

417
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,900
So I might be able to
create agents on WhatsApp

418
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,230
that can actually help
answer specific questions,

419
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,610
thereby actually relieving the call center

420
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,320
of actually having those conversations.

421
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,450
More importantly, it reacts

422
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,240
and builds a lot more
trust on the channel,

423
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,030
but most importantly, for
brands that are looking

424
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,630
to build relevance with customers,

425
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,850
this becomes a very important channel

426
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,800
because one of the most important things

427
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,140
that you'll realize about WhatsApp is that

428
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,263
it's a very trust earned
channel for customers.

429
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,080
Meaning they can just block you,

430
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,913
and if they block you

431
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,810
then you can't send any messages to them,

432
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,700
any type of messages to them.

433
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,500
So it's a very trust based channel

434
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,390
and I think it bleeds in

435
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,750
very much into the AWS
holistic philosophy of

436
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,420
being able to build secure communications

437
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,850
across the stack.

438
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,840
As far as how to actually
put this together,

439
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,190
you know, I'm gonna invite Bipin

440
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,170
to actually come and share with you

441
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,250
about how you would integrate
this into your applications.

442
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,648
Thanks Bipin.

443
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:28,620
- Thank you.

444
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,610
Thank you.

445
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,410
Thanks Afeef, thanks Venky.

446
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,420
I get to do the more exciting part.

447
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,070
This is why like you got
to the whole frame of like

448
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,530
why WhatsApp, why this
channel is so important,

449
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,050
he touched on many areas of that.

450
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,410
You also kind of in my frame of thought,

451
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,120
like I always think
like the who, what, why,

452
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,090
or like what so what and next what, right?

453
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,770
This is the most interesting part,

454
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,030
like how do we put this together

455
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,480
and I get to talk about that.

456
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,580
At the same time I'm not gonna
do any code walkthroughs,

457
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,380
not writing any code,

458
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,930
and you'll still walk out

459
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,230
thinking like how you could
do this in 10 minutes,

460
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,570
by yourself with no code,

461
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,970
and thanks for the
integration we have in place.

462
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,790
So if you guys are familiar
with AWS ecosystem in general,

463
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,430
like the AWS console itself, this,

464
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,820
what you have is you have
WhatsApp as a integrated channel

465
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,630
as part of your AWS End
User Messaging product.

466
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,340
So when you open AWS

467
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,480
and if you're thinking about

468
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,420
how do I put this integration together,

469
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,110
you simply use the AWS End
User Messaging console.

470
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,640
You have a social
messaging service in that,

471
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,900
you just select that.

472
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,800
Once you enter that,

473
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,370
there's a whole embedded
signup process in that.

474
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,380
Without leaving the ecosystem,

475
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,160
you're now pretty much
a visit driven process

476
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,550
that will walk you through

477
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,520
like either you have a Facebook account,

478
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,420
if yes, you are simply
auth yourself into that.

479
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,540
You got your Facebook account connected,

480
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,800
you have your business
manager accounts in Facebook,

481
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,590
you can select one or you can set one up.

482
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,890
The process is again,
all within this wizard,

483
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,110
you now have your
WhatsApp business account,

484
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,030
you have one or you set one up.

485
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,500
All of this happens right in
the end user messaging console

486
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,600
through the social messaging service.

487
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,430
Once you have all of this set up,

488
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,080
once you confirm all of this,

489
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,820
and trust me, like this is a part

490
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,460
which is actually the most complex step,

491
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,550
but it takes probably five
minutes and 10 for some.

492
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,920
But depending on if you're setting one,

493
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,970
something up very new

494
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,300
or you are just connecting
your existing accounts.

495
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,460
And this is where you get
provisioned with a phone number,

496
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,630
you get provisioned with

497
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,790
like the entire authentication service

498
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,480
with the social messaging
component of WhatsApp.

499
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,033
And within the end user messaging service,

500
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,930
you're basically verifying your number,

501
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,820
which is also pretty straightforward.

502
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,350
You are provisioned through
the end user messaging API now,

503
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,730
and this is a point where

504
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,900
you pretty much have
your plumbing in place,

505
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,320
you've got AWS and WhatsApp
talking to each other now.

506
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,153
And this is where now

507
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:22,320
you get to the programmatic aspect of it.

508
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,870
Depending on your business use case flows,

509
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,870
you could pretty much
connect with the Amazon SNS

510
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,320
or Amazon Connect.

511
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,250
These are the two services

512
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,440
you can easily connect and configure.

513
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,240
And you can pretty much have

514
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,930
an event driven automation
or using AWS Lambda

515
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,930
to trigger messages
based on realtime events

516
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,530
from your application
or other trigger points,

517
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,580
and directly with the agent
console on Amazon Connect.

518
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,570
Go either ways.

519
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,800
Again, this is like,

520
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,500
think of it as like the
Lego blocks are in place

521
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,850
and you could construct,

522
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,740
orchestrate your use case flow

523
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,960
the way you might imagine.

524
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,780
But you got two big
ecosystems and platforms

525
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,980
already connected and
talking to each other.

526
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,700
Now, this is where I wanna make sure

527
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,750
like you guys understand,

528
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,450
like it's not about just the construct of

529
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,610
enabling your use case but,

530
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,660
which is good, but now you
also have right out of the box

531
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,240
is all of the analytics,
the observability,

532
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,390
the ability to learn about your message

533
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,710
and all of those things

534
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,210
once you are WhatsApp account

535
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,643
and the event messages flow through.

536
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,560
You can actually automatically
start scaling this

537
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,260
because again, you don't
have to worry about

538
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,210
the infra behind all of this.

539
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,560
You can just start scaling

540
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,990
your real world use cases right away

541
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,943
once this integration is in place.

542
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,380
What it also allows you to do is like

543
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,400
send, also automated,

544
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,410
like as Afeef I think already touched upon

545
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,240
some very nice use cases

546
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,360
where you could send real
time updates about your orders

547
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,030
as soon as a e-commerce event happens,

548
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,010
or let's say a cancellation happens

549
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,910
or a scheduling, the update happens,

550
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,820
you can route almost some of these things.

551
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,820
Again, the reason I brought
up a AWS Lambda and SNS is,

552
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,990
like you could pretty much
have your own orchestration

553
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,580
of this, if this, then that

554
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,050
and WhatsApp is nothing but an event point

555
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,480
or a channel that you may
think that can be triggered

556
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,813
by one of these events when
they satisfy the conditions.

557
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,530
And you can track the whole performance

558
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,940
of this entire orchestration,

559
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,710
which is your AWS console now

560
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,550
allows you to get insights on
your entire message payload,

561
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,980
the entire message journey
through its lifecycle,

562
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,570
the number of messages that I send,

563
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,820
the number of templates
you're working with,

564
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,250
the tags, and whatnot thereof.

565
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,520
Like so you have down
the grain auditability

566
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,020
of all of your messages

567
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,503
that are happening through
this implementation now.

568
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:05,090
At this point I wanna pass on to Afeef

569
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,990
to walk you through some case studies.

570
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,380
- Thank you so much Bipin.

571
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,000
So I mentioned earlier on

572
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,490
that there are 600
million daily interactions

573
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,090
between businesses and
customers on WhatsApp already.

574
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,370
So I wanted to illustrate a
couple of those case studies

575
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,761
so you guys can see

576
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,900
how our business is taking
advantage of WhatsApp.

577
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,330
So the first example here
is a hospital network

578
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,120
in Indonesia called Siloam hospitals.

579
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,730
In Indonesia WhatsApp is,

580
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,670
it's kind of the communication protocol

581
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,050
that most people use already
for consumer communication.

582
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,150
So it really made sense for a business,

583
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,680
in this case a healthcare business

584
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,570
to try to get in touch
with their customers

585
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,973
in that same channel that
they're already using.

586
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,190
Prior to using WhatsApp,

587
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,730
Siloam, for all communications
with their customers,

588
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,890
whether it was to remind
them about appointment,

589
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,500
whether it was to schedule appointment,

590
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,651
they were doing it largely
through email and calls,

591
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:03,330
but they realized that
they weren't doing it

592
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,800
in the most efficient way.

593
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,180
And so they actually moved

594
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,210
all of their communication over to,

595
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,580
all of their customer
communication over to WhatsApp.

596
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,100
And they saw some really
great results out of this.

597
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,740
They saw an 8% increase
in appointment bookings

598
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,870
after launching automated messaging.

599
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,660
They saw really notably a 36% increase

600
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,790
in self-patient check-ins,

601
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,580
you know, because the prompts
were sent in WhatsApp saying,

602
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,470
Hey, you've got an appointment
coming up tomorrow,

603
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,810
fill out this paperwork
before your appointment.

604
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,810
As you can imagine, this
saved significant resources

605
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,003
and time of people being at that,

606
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,680
being at the hospital

607
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,140
and not needing to fill
out paperwork there.

608
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,850
And finally, when customer
service inquiries came through

609
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,320
previously they were taking a week

610
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,080
for all of those inquiries to be tackled,

611
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,970
after implementing WhatsApp

612
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,370
for all of their
communication with customers,

613
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,400
80% of cases were actually
able to be dealt with

614
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,530
within 24 hours.

615
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,630
And so in this instance, Siloam Hospitals,

616
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,840
they did this largely
through utility messages,

617
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,363
but also marketing messages as well.

618
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,280
One other case study
I wanted to highlight,

619
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,330
this is a Brazilian
digital bank called PicPay.

620
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,720
So as a digital bank with
no physical footprint,

621
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,520
it was really important for PicPay

622
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,007
to be able to do the customer onboarding

623
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:25,902
and the security verification
of that individual

624
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:28,230
with, you know, digitally.

625
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,740
And so the issue that PicPay had was

626
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,660
previously they were doing this over SMS

627
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,490
and they found that a lot of customers

628
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,740
were not completing the onboarding,

629
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,410
and so they wanted to move
that over to WhatsApp.

630
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,280
They started servicing the
OTP passcodes through WhatsApp

631
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,210
and they saw a 3.5% increase
in customers onboarding

632
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,040
and then also a 6.5% increase
in verification rates.

633
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,530
So this is, you know, another illustration

634
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,120
of a totally different use
case from Siloam hospitals,

635
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,880
and here they were using a
different message type as well.

636
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,640
They were using authentication
messages exclusively,

637
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
whereas in the previous example, you know,

638
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,360
I was showing largely utility messages,

639
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,798
but there were some marketing
messages from Siloam.

640
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,955
If you remember from when
I was speaking earlier,

641
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:14,280
the businesses that see the best value

642
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,290
out of their investment in WhatsApp

643
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,840
are those that use multiple message types.

644
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,810
You can imagine that in
the example with Siloam,

645
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,360
because they were getting
appointment reminders,

646
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,630
if there was then, you
know, a marketing message,

647
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,120
I'll make like an American example of it,

648
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,380
hey, it's a December

649
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,510
have you used all of your
healthcare benefits, right?

650
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,150
Someone is more likely to
interact with that message

651
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,890
when they've received messages before

652
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,290
that remind them about
what their appointment,

653
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,590
remind them about their
appointment reminders.

654
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,060
So, you know, to sum up here,

655
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,310
I hope that you all
have learned a lot about

656
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,370
the different messaging
types that WhatsApp employs

657
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,770
and how that can enable a
business to get in touch

658
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,810
with the customer through any element

659
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,170
and in fact every element
of the customer journey.

660
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,610
And in fact WhatsApp I would say

661
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,110
enriches each of those elements

662
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,540
of the customer journey as well.

663
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,690
My call to action to you all
is it's pretty simple actually,

664
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,790
you know, get started
with WhatsApp business.

665
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,380
If you're a business that's thinking about

666
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,120
how you can get in touch with customers

667
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,040
in a different way, try it out.

668
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,080
As Bipin and Venky talked about,

669
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,930
we have a native integration with AWS,

670
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,250
so if you're an existing AWS customer,

671
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,290
you literally just need
to go to the console,

672
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,420
you can get set up within
about 10 or 15 minutes

673
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,570
and have your WhatsApp
business account provision

674
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,093
directly within the AWS console.

675
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,140
Additionally, for anyone
that wants to learn more,

676
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,260
we have a booth, Booth875,
and you can go down there

677
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,570
and there's some touchscreens
where you can play around

678
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,250
with those different message types.

679
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,850
Again, the marketing utility,

680
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,390
authentication and service messages

681
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,100
so you could see what a message flow

682
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,700
would look like with businesses.

683
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,160
And in addition, we have
more case studies there

684
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,600
for you to learn about it.

685
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,480
So with that, thank you
all so much for your time.

686
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
I hope this is beneficial for you all

687
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,984
and I hope to see you guys
using WhatsApp business.

688
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:07,385
(attendees applauding)
