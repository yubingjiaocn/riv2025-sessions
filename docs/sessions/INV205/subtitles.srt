1
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:01,809
Before I used Kiro,

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:06,750
I was very stuck in the details of syntax and

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,439
oh,
I've got to switch to this programming language for this code repo.

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:11,640
How,
how do I

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,529
do a variable or,

6
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,159
you know,
something pretty basic

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,860
and Quiro can

8
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:17,930
do it for me.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,879
We now have a way to understand and interact with and define

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,100
our code,

11
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,760
our business,

12
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,215
our.
Requirements in ways that we never did before.

13
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:29,305
Gone are the days of spending hours debugging,

14
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:31,854
looking for a tiny hidden semicolon.

15
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,215
Kira helps me through the entire process.

16
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:37,034
I started coding in my early teens,

17
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:41,025
and the first time I wrote a piece of code and I was able to successfully run it,

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,755
it gave me a lot of joy,

19
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:46,125
and I feel that Quiro brings back that spark.

20
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:47,215
Going down.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,009
The ordinary routes of just building code from scratch

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,610
would have taken us weeks,

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,650
but with Quiro,

24
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,750
we were able to,

25
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,270
in the space of 3 days,

26
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,229
go from zero to hero.

27
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,189
It is a partner I have with me throughout the entire process.

28
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,709
I ask it questions,

29
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,360
I start the development with it.

30
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,089
I create specs with it,

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,040
and I learn while using Quiro.

32
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,410
I've been working on trying to add some new features to this large system.

33
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,480
It is helping me from start to finish with ideation,

34
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,319
from actually coming up with requirements,

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,839
tasks,

36
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:18,339
and

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,080
execution.

38
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,940
Have

39
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,739
my idea be reality without

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,779
the most mundane part of it was just,

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,319
you know,
the typing of the keystrokes.

42
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:30,720
And it gives me a different perspective and enables me to do whatever comes to mind,

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,260
honestly.

44
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm Kyra's biggest fan,

45
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,019
I'm pretty sure.

46
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,480
Please welcome to the stage vice president

47
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,739
of Developer agents and experiences at AWS

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,959
Deepak Singh.

49
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,819
Good morning.

50
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,449
Thank you for joining me today.

51
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:49,910
So,
my name is Deepak,

52
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,790
and I run the Developer Agents and Experiences Organization at AWS.

53
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,449
So,

54
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,870
as you've seen,

55
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:57,720
as you just saw,

56
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,790
and as you've probably heard throughout this conference,

57
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,849
it is an incredibly exciting time to be a developer

58
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,480
and to be working with artificial intelligence.

59
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,110
Over the last few years,

60
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,770
we've witnessed a major transformation

61
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,729
in how

62
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,470
software is being built.

63
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,770
We've gone from

64
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:14,770
simple

65
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,490
autocompletion using a coding assistant.

66
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,919
To sophisticated AI agents that can write complete applications,

67
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,350
multi-file applications

68
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,220
in one go.

69
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,080
They can reason,

70
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,020
they can help you plan,

71
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,550
they can implement your software,

72
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,149
and usually all you need

73
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,070
is simple natural language prompts

74
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,250
or a diagram or two.

75
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,029
So refactoring projects which used to take

76
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,240
days now get done in hours.

77
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:38,449
Debugging sessions can be done in a few minutes.

78
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,110
I just saw an example there.

79
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,070
and

80
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,960
projects that used to take months can get done in weeks,

81
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,289
and features that used to take weeks can now be done over a single weekend.

82
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,550
And I actually talked about a couple.

83
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,009
We are quickly shifting

84
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,910
to a world where agentic AI not only allows us to write code faster,

85
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,850
it's actually a collaborative assistant.

86
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,490
You work with the agent.

87
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,559
You,
it,

88
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,649
it helps you achieve a different kind of flow state.

89
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,289
You get to continue working,

90
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,880
but now you almost have this second assistant sitting with you,

91
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:09,029
a powerful brain

92
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,740
that helps you move so much faster.

93
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,509
This is a brain that helps

94
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,669
learns from every line of code it sees.

95
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,589
It recognizes patterns and opportunities for improvement.

96
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,190
It gets smarter with every interaction.

97
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,490
Every commit

98
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,869
and every deployment.

99
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,500
And this is what today's agents give us.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,779
You could call them superpowers that enable new ways of delivering software.

101
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,220
They significantly

102
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:32,699
accelerate innovation.

103
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,160
We are seeing this every day,

104
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,339
both on Amazon and with our customers,

105
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,380
especially in a world where speed and differentiation

106
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,059
are absolutely key.

107
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,860
This transformation has been quite remarkable,

108
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:44,529
and

109
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,740
yet it still feels like it's the early days.

110
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,279
As I look back,

111
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:53,059
I'm kind of reminded of August 2006.

112
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,070
Show of hands,

113
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,380
who remembers what happened in August 2006?

114
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:58,309
No,

115
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,970
that's when EC2 was launched.

116
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,110
Uh,
EC2 came out in August 2006 in beta.

117
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,250
I was not an Amazon at the time.

118
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,789
I was a bioinformatician

119
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,470
at a bioinformatics company,

120
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,270
and I already had an S3 account and I set it up a few months earlier when S3 had come up,

121
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,570
and I launched my first EC2 instance.

122
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,670
Great.

123
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,130
And a few days after that,

124
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,230
there was an evening

125
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,390
where I,

126
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,108
on a whim,

127
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,429
fired up 22,

128
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,549
20 EC2 instances,

129
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,089
which is the limit you got at the time.

130
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,179
And

131
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,899
ran a protein secondary structure algorithm,

132
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,339
a simple feed single layer feed forward neural network

133
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,899
to predict the secondary structure of a bunch of protein sequences just

134
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,920
because I wanted to.

135
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,130
That felt absolutely magical.

136
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,239
It made me feel empowered in ways that I had never felt before,

137
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:43,859
and less than 2 years later,

138
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,660
I joined AWS because that was so amazing.

139
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,440
The kind of empowerment is what

140
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,320
we feel,

141
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,519
what I see builders around me experiencing.

142
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:53,640
Every day,

143
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,809
and it's the kind of empowerment that you get

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,480
as a software developer once,

145
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,040
maybe 15 to 20 years.

146
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,940
Being a developer is

147
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,200
an extraordinary role.

148
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,119
You get to build meaningful solutions.

149
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,720
You push technological boundaries.

150
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
You leverage cutting edge cloud technologies to

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,459
create exceptional software to help customers,

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,420
but it's also quite challenging.

153
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,619
You would love

154
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,179
to keep building features for everybody you know to

155
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,299
do things that

156
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,239
spark your innovation,

157
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,799
your passion,

158
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,579
your fulfillment,

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,279
but you also often get stuck in tedious,

160
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,540
mundane activities.

161
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,329
They're not bad,

162
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,000
they're important,

163
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,000
but you have to do them.

164
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,089
At AWS our mission is to empower developers

165
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,029
by harnessing the power of AI

166
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,809
and what we want to do is

167
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,970
eliminate the friction

168
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,529
between vision and execution.

169
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,230
We want you to create at the speed of thought.

170
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:46,929
We want you to achieve breakthroughs that were once unimaginable,

171
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,690
or

172
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,489
you're constantly putting aside because you're busy with other things.

173
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,649
The developer landscape is evolving rapidly,

174
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,869
and our goal is to help you navigate this transformation.

175
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,450
For a very,

176
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,459
very long time,

177
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,179
the only way you could build was by handling

178
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,290
most of the work yourself.

179
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,119
Some of you remember when

180
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,920
you had to write every line of code,

181
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
you had to debug issues,

182
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,679
you had to update documentation,

183
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,429
you had to manage your dependencies,

184
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,820
and then you had to work through deployments.

185
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,059
Today,

186
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,019
AI agents in two ways.

187
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,859
They help you spend your time effectively on things that matter.

188
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,299
They either offload the tedious tasks.

189
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,619
You have a bunch of things that you need to get done,

190
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,019
but you're busy with something else,

191
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,579
you can give those to the AI,

192
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,399
or

193
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,739
you can collaborate with the AI,

194
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,679
as I said earlier,

195
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,619
and accelerate the things that you really,

196
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,619
really care about.

197
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,380
So

198
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,390
the things that you want to pay attention to yourself,

199
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,760
in the end you get to focus on what matters to you,

200
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,470
ideally what's bringing innovative ideas to life.

201
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,869
This rise of human agent collaboration has revealed some

202
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,089
super important patterns over the last few years.

203
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:54,690
We started

204
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,959
with AI just generating chunks of code,

205
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,149
sometimes initially just a line,

206
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,890
a line or two at a time,

207
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,010
to multiple lines to multiple files,

208
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,049
and today

209
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,290
you can collaborate

210
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,929
with agents and humans and actually

211
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,769
you're increasingly agents collaborating with agents

212
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,029
on larger and more complex tasks.

213
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,890
So

214
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,529
your role is to give the agent the right context.

215
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,170
The right set of tools,

216
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,279
the right input,

217
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,299
and provide that human judgment and guidance that only you can.

218
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,089
And developers need these AI capabilities embedded

219
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,790
throughout their workflow

220
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,850
from initial planning

221
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,549
all the way through testing and deployment.

222
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,730
Perhaps the most crucial insight that we've had

223
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,239
was that to truly transform software development,

224
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,899
it's not just about having access to an agent.

225
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,309
You need to think about how AI is going to get

226
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:44,429
embedded from the beginning all the way to the end.

227
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,890
So not just with coding,

228
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,589
but also how you shape your architectural decisions,

229
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,299
how you identify edge cases,

230
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,239
how you maintain best practices throughout your flow,

231
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:54,209
and

232
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:55,450
these lessons

233
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,459
are inspiring,

234
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,290
and we get them from watching teams.

235
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,899
Where we work,

236
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,309
watching our customers,

237
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,410
they help

238
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,059
inspire how we think about the future of what developer tools are.

239
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,890
They are shaping our vision for building

240
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,250
integrated AI solutions and integrated AI development experiences.

241
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,579
This is not a future trend.

242
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,269
It's happening right now.

243
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,640
6 months ago it felt like the future,

244
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,410
but 6 months in the world of AI and agents is

245
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,779
almost like 6 years.

246
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,470
The most successful developers are already embracing it.

247
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,339
I like to say they're jumping into

248
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,880
the Olympic pool without a life preserver and saying we're going to figure this out,

249
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,619
and they do.

250
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,719
We've actually noticed something super interesting

251
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,260
as we talked to these developers.

252
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,599
Some developers are seeing 1015,

253
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,299
20% productivity as they start using these tools.

254
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,239
Others are achieving 5 times,

255
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,419
10 times more

256
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,830
productivity improvements.

257
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,349
They're using the same tools.

258
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,619
So what's the difference?

259
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,219
The difference is that it's becoming

260
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,500
increasingly clear.

261
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,479
It isn't just about using an AI tool.

262
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,460
It's just a tool.

263
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,150
It's how you use the tool,

264
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,380
how you're helping yourself move faster,

265
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,400
and it's

266
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,950
You get there by fundamentally changing how we approach software development.

267
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,729
The most successful software developers,

268
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,320
and we get to see them in action often,

269
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,479
are rethinking their entire process,

270
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,979
rethinking how their teams think about the process of software development,

271
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,840
and they're using AI agents as collaborators

272
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,719
and constantly working with them

273
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,919
to achieve these kind,

274
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,049
these crazy results that we are seeing.

275
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:28,760
It's a mindset shift,

276
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,020
but that's what you need to get that level of improvement.

277
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:36,380
I talked about EC2.

278
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,109
Cloud computing transformed how we think about infrastructure.

279
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,359
You no longer had to think about how you rack and stack

280
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,140
hardware.

281
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,799
Agentic AI is freeing us from this code first

282
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:47,500
development.

283
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,799
It's not a bad thing to

284
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,789
think code first,

285
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,520
but it's changing how code is developed,

286
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,820
um.

287
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,710
I'm a musician in my free time,

288
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:56,619
a terrible one,

289
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,969
but there's this piece of software called Ableton Live.

290
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,799
For those of you who've used it.

291
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,909
It has a nonlinear way of developing which

292
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:05,250
takes you away from the standard left to right

293
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,950
tape track way of

294
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,460
building software music that all the other software used to do.

295
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:11,450
And this game,

296
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,419
and it completely revolutionized software and music and how music is made.

297
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,650
AI agents are doing the same thing with software.

298
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,429
We are working towards a world.

299
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,159
Very,
very rapidly

300
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,940
when natural language intent

301
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,200
or an image

302
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:25,380
or a diagram

303
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,619
or pseudocode,

304
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:29,869
that intent becomes working software.

305
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,919
It is a world where tools that we need to build software look

306
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,000
quite different.

307
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,840
I like to think that what you need is not a code editor,

308
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,659
but a more conversational context management system,

309
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,719
something that helps you drive and write down

310
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,219
what the agent needs,

311
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,479
drive its behavior

312
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,099
to get to the place you want to go to.

313
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,140
Uh,

314
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,940
you're almost

315
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,510
spending more time supervising,

316
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,039
managing,

317
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,080
and reviewing the work of AI agents

318
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,789
than you are typing on a keyboard to

319
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:56,580
with,
with

320
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,140
some

321
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,419
coding programming language.

322
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,229
The other way to think about this is

323
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,340
just the early coding assistants were just tools.

324
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,570
Agents are not mere tools.

325
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,070
You can refactor an entire code base and manage

326
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,650
multi file changes.

327
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,590
Your role as a developer

328
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,609
is no longer just typing.

329
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,309
You're orchestrating these agents,

330
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,070
and that.

331
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,909
It's not something that happens right away.

332
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,590
You have to learn.

333
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,250
Agents,

334
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,210
the craft of software engineering

335
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:25,909
is evolving.

336
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,359
Software engineering is a craft

337
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:28,119
you

338
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,669
learn it by doing it.

339
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,190
Yes,
there are college courses,

340
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:33,049
school courses.

341
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,869
They'll teach it to you.

342
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:34,989
You'll learn a language,

343
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,750
but to become a really good developer,

344
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,570
you have to do it for a long period of time.

345
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,469
And we are seeing a lot of people learn this,

346
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:42,590
relearn this craft,

347
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,830
take what they have learned as software developers,

348
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,210
as systems thinkers,

349
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:48,489
and apply it to agentic software development.

350
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,320
It's a change in the calculus of how software is built.

351
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:53,539
So think about it,

352
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,539
your team size,

353
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,729
how the team is structured,

354
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,260
your development velocity,

355
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:59,020
how you think about technical debt.

356
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:01,869
All of these things are going to get reshaped

357
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:03,020
over the coming months,

358
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,479
I'm not even saying years,

359
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,440
and,

360
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:06,020
and it,

361
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,479
it'll get reshaped because you're going to build software differently.

362
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,179
It's going to change because we approach our

363
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,679
teams and how they approach building software differently,

364
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,539
and

365
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,179
it changes how we think about what's possible or

366
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,919
if I paraphrase Matt Garman from two days ago,

367
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:20,979
why not?

368
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,409
So let me illustrate what this shift means in practice,

369
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,369
as I said.

370
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,530
On the,

371
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:27,890
you know,

372
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,669
a few seconds ago,

373
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,630
software developers are craftspeople.

374
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,289
If you want to take it to an extreme,

375
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,950
a lot of folks take

376
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,390
pride in meticulously writing every line of code,

377
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,809
how their code is structured,

378
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,260
what it looks like on screen,

379
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,030
how they orchestrate these tools and manage every aspect of the development

380
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,049
themselves.

381
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:47,929
But there is a

382
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:49,030
challenge that comes with it.

383
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,109
Sometimes in,

384
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,390
as you write code,

385
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,549
as you're building your software,

386
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,340
some of the critical decisions,

387
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,070
strategic,

388
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,830
architectural,

389
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,570
business,

390
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,929
often come later down and you

391
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,210
have to go back and make some costly changes.

392
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,900
This AI agentic paradigm kind of flips this on its head.

393
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,549
As a developer,

394
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,500
you can front load a lot of these

395
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,940
high value strategic architectural and business decisions

396
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,380
and the discussions you may have with your design team or your product team,

397
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,539
and then you work with the AI agent

398
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,520
to explore what the implications could be.

399
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,039
You can work through trade-offs really quickly because

400
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
you can build prototypes really fast.

401
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,020
You can do it even before any code is written,

402
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:30,059
but you can also write a quick application to just get your mental model right,

403
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,719
to make sure that you're thinking straight.

404
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,559
And,

405
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,109
and part of this is all the execution is being handled by the agent itself.

406
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,679
It is not just that you've taken the level of abstraction higher,

407
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:43,219
because

408
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,840
you know in the world of software that's every few years

409
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,900
you try and come up with a new layer of abstraction.

410
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:51,900
It's about enabling developers to think through the entire system

411
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,960
holistically

412
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:56,760
to ensure that there are implementation details aligned with what your vision was.

413
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,380
How do you take what's in your head

414
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,000
and convert it into a running application that's going

415
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,640
to be maintainable for a period of time.

416
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,780
And what we've seen and what we observe

417
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,059
is these rich technical conversations,

418
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,159
these conversations about why you,

419
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,320
why you're even doing what you want to do,

420
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,599
they happen up front.

421
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,340
And

422
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:18,250
then the goal becomes how you drive the agent to get you to where you want it to be,

423
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,099
and that's where you get these 5x,

424
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:22,760
10x develop productivity gains.

425
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:26,229
It doesn't.

426
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,869
It's not just about how we write changing how we write code.

427
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,349
It's how we write software,

428
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:31,309
and

429
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,890
developers can go,

430
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,530
you can join it at any point you want.

431
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,309
You can start by writing a concept.

432
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,609
Your product manager or your designer can come up with

433
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,070
a concept and bring it to you with the prototype,

434
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,549
and then your job becomes how do you convert that into a working solution

435
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,770
with the help of your friendly neighborhood agent.

436
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,200
And instead of,

437
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,900
you know,

438
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,099
you can get,

439
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:54,820
you know,
even in AWS where historically we've developed features using

440
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,559
product press releases and FAQs,

441
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,719
very often the way a new piece of software is

442
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,580
built is somebody goes off for a few hours,

443
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,679
maybe the product manager,

444
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,679
maybe a developer,

445
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,619
maybe your dev manager who hasn't previously hadn't coded for a few years,

446
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,799
and they quickly come up with a specification,

447
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,580
a design,

448
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,280
a prototype,

449
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,039
and then all of you can review it and say,

450
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,400
yep,

451
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,520
we know we can build this in the next couple of days.

452
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,280
We see this happening all the time.

453
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:21,630
This is

454
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:22,789
quite a shift.

455
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:23,729
It's not easy.

456
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,770
It's not a technical change.

457
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,450
You are,

458
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:27,409
in the end,

459
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,590
you're still building software.

460
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,349
It's the how you build that software,

461
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,239
how you organize to build that software,

462
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,760
what you get comfortable with.

463
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:34,969
All of that changes,

464
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,210
and you get unprecedented speed from idea to implementation,

465
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,250
and you'll see a few examples of this today.

466
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,090
This flow of AI coding workflows is kind of awesome.

467
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:49,719
You can get going really quickly.

468
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:50,679
I can,

469
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,640
I've stopped counting the number of applications I've built just to show my son

470
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:58,719
an example of some scientific thing like how the solar system works or

471
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,739
Maxwell's equations.

472
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,659
Don't ask me why,

473
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:04,539
but as these tasks become more complex and ambiguous,

474
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:06,799
You,

475
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,299
the,

476
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,780
how you interact with an agent only takes so far.

477
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,650
Um,

478
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,039
you need to start thinking at the systems level.

479
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,719
Uh,

480
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,409
very often,

481
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,539
systems thinking happens only when you are a senior engineer.

482
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,419
I would argue that

483
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,770
as a junior engineer you need to start

484
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,830
thinking about it less from the

485
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,070
from the side of I'm writing a particular piece of software,

486
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:27,969
I'm writing code

487
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,460
to how's my system going to work,

488
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:30,770
why am I even building this,

489
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,770
what are the components it needs to have,

490
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,429
and then you work with the agent to get to where you want to.

491
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,690
You're no longer thinking about the nitty gritty of

492
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,690
the actual coding process itself,

493
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:40,669
and that's

494
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,650
for some people that's a huge change.

495
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,289
We've also found,

496
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,359
especially

497
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,479
over the last 6 to 9 months,

498
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:50,479
that

499
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:53,289
When people started using AI agents,

500
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,460
they got pretty comfortable with it.

501
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,630
They'd start talking to it,

502
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,369
or vibing,

503
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,210
as they called it.

504
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,640
That word,

505
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,239
we live in the techT generation.

506
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,280
I think vibing has almost gone out of fashion.

507
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,199
I don't know why it came up,

508
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,000
disappeared,

509
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,300
uh,

510
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,579
but it also became increasingly clear.

511
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,520
My favorite example is you build an app and 10 days later you have no idea why the

512
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,900
app is doing what you did,

513
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:15,439
what did,

514
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,719
what prompts you had written,

515
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,339
and if you hand it to somebody else,

516
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,160
you completely lose all context.

517
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,000
So you needed constant oversight

518
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,260
from design decisions.

519
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,618
You were writing it down to documentation and testing.

520
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,009
And the question we asked ourselves was,

521
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,078
is there a more structured framework that we could

522
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,029
use to make this whole process a lot easier,

523
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:33,119
to bring out,

524
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,029
are there any artifacts that can help

525
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,188
you remember

526
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,468
six months from now,

527
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,428
or if you hand it off to a different team,

528
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:41,828
why you did what you did

529
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,749
so they can continue going from there

530
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:45,468
and not just looking at the code

531
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,269
and

532
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,760
Well,
how could we bring the lessons from very mature software engineering practices

533
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,000
to build maintainable software

534
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:54,180
using AI?

535
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,500
And Takiro

536
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,520
That's why we built it

537
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,530
and why we built what we call spec driven development.

538
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,859
The idea with Quiro

539
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,680
is to help developers and teams do their best work

540
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,630
by bringing

541
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,560
Mature software engineering practices

542
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,880
to AI-driven coding

543
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,619
with

544
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,760
the idea of spec-driven development and the concept of spec-driven development.

545
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:17,209
So

546
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,069
what is it?

547
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,890
So the way it does it is you want

548
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:22,329
to go from idea

549
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,209
to a functioning application,

550
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,010
but you

551
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,500
also know that application is going to evolve from there.

552
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,650
It may go on to another team.

553
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,030
You may add components to it.

554
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,859
You may be part of a company that requires enterprise grid controls.

555
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,420
We wanted all of those things,

556
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,170
whether you're an individual developer

557
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:41,109
all the way to a team of a very large team at a big enterprise,

558
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,209
or to be able to use these concepts

559
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,369
and be able to build

560
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,229
using AI.

561
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:46,569
So

562
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:50,109
The way Quiro works is you can start off with a simple set of prompts.

563
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,239
You can convert these prompts into a

564
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,380
clear set of requirements and structured designs.

565
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,079
You can start your prompts don't have to be natural language.

566
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,579
They can be an image.

567
00:18:58,829 --> 00:18:59,839
They can be a diagram.

568
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:00,959
They can be pseudocode.

569
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:01,920
What's in your head,

570
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,300
how you express them.

571
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,880
It can be done by a product manager.

572
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,530
It can be done by a designer.

573
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,640
It can be done by a software developer.

574
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,030
Quiro then works with you to convert these specifications into working code,

575
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,660
into working documentation,

576
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,119
into working tests.

577
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,530
You have a feature called Agent hooks.

578
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,130
It's a feature we don't talk about that much,

579
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,329
but it's one of the most useful features of Quiro.

580
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,229
Agent hooks automate routine tasks in the background,

581
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,609
and what you can use agent hooks for

582
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,310
is to enforce development best practices automatically.

583
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,150
And

584
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,729
Quiro is fundamentally multimodal.

585
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,390
You have smart context management

586
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,949
that helps you continue to work

587
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:37,890
the way you want to.

588
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,150
And your access to frontier models like Clotssonnet 4.5,

589
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,579
Opus 4.5,

590
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,189
so you can pick and choose.

591
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,349
You might want quality,

592
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,069
speed,

593
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:47,550
cost,

594
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,329
all of those are factors that you as a developer

595
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,630
get to think about.

596
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,359
So what happens at the end,

597
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:55,520
you get the familiarity and fun

598
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,979
of what we used to call white coding.

599
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:58,569
You can

600
00:19:58,979 --> 00:19:59,479
just

601
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,209
talk to your agent.

602
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,680
You can get going really quickly,

603
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:02,719
but

604
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,900
you have much more powerful,

605
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,829
maintainable

606
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:08,469
code and a developer experience that helps you get there.

607
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,880
So you can tackle any project regardless of its size or complexity.

608
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,329
This spec driven

609
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,750
approach struck a chord with a whole bunch of developers.

610
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,060
When we launched Quiro in preview just in the 1st 5 days,

611
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,040
we got over 100,000 developers,

612
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,030
and since then,

613
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,500
hundreds of thousands of developers outside of Amazon have continued to use Quiro.

614
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,560
And,

615
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:31,910
and

616
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,709
you know you've seen some great examples throughout this conference.

617
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:39,510
What makes spectrumn development so useful and powerful?

618
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,250
Uh,

619
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,510
one of the artifacts

620
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,959
that Quiro builds with a prompt is a requirements doc.

621
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,410
It's in Es notation.

622
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:46,739
For those of you who are familiar with EEAS,

623
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,579
it's a markdown-based,

624
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,189
structured way of writing down a set of requirements.

625
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,910
Quiro can then extract properties from those requirements,

626
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,369
and this is why I love specs.

627
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,890
And then

628
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:01,689
from these properties it can determine which ones need to be logically tested,

629
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,729
and it generates hundreds of thousands of random test cases

630
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,859
to check your code.

631
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:09,010
It helps you figure out whether this intent that you had

632
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,270
expressed

633
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,790
with a set of prompts that got converted into a spec

634
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,810
is the application and the code that comes out at the end

635
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,530
actually doing what you wanted.

636
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,410
So

637
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,089
let's take,

638
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,229
let's look at an example.

639
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,010
Let's say you're building a car sales app.

640
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,729
You may want,

641
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,609
you know,
your traditional unit test approach would be

642
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,589
user adds car number 5 to favorites,

643
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,630
car number 5 appears in a list,

644
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,229
and you would do a unit test for that.

645
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,010
You may do a few more unit tests

646
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,650
with this property-based testing approach.

647
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:40,569
The way Quiro works is

648
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:41,430
for any,

649
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,410
you know,
it writes a requirement which will be something

650
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,310
like for any user and any car listing.

651
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,520
That when the car

652
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,130
gets added to favorites,

653
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,900
display the car in the favorites list.

654
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:52,800
That's how it'll get converted into ears.

655
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,500
With some specific language that ES supports,

656
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,579
and then

657
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,609
what Quiro will do will extract

658
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,719
a set of tests and build them for you,

659
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:02,510
things like

660
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:04,449
user A adds car number 1,

661
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,170
user B adds car number 500,

662
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,170
user C adds 5 cars,

663
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,869
uh,
user D.

664
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,430
Has special characters in their username.

665
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,989
You may have cards with various statuses,

666
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:15,430
you,

667
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,829
you know,

668
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:16,270
new,

669
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,829
used,

670
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:17,550
you know,

671
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,209
pre-certified,

672
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:19,260
all of that,

673
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,229
hundreds and thousands of more combinations that help you catch these edge cases.

674
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,849
These are generated automatically.

675
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,569
These are tested automatically,

676
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:30,510
and what you are doing is you're verifying that the what the code and

677
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,069
software that comes out at the end matches the intent in your head.

678
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,640
This is remarkably powerful,

679
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,170
and it's just the first step

680
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,949
towards software verification.

681
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,109
If you saw Swami's keynote yesterday,

682
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,329
I think it was yesterday,

683
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,969
reinvent just flies by.

684
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,459
You heard Byron Cook on stage talk about neurosymbolic AI.

685
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,349
You can,

686
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,780
because you have structure in a spec,

687
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,989
you can start applying neurosymbolic techniques

688
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:54,650
which will help you make sure

689
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,709
that your code is doing what you wanted,

690
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:58,209
and that's how you build trust

691
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,989
in AI agents.

692
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,930
That's how you can move

693
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,349
at the speed of light.

694
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:04,229
So,

695
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,469
Developers are finicky.

696
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,280
Some people like IDs.

697
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,229
Some people.

698
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,859
Like the terminal.

699
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:13,880
Uh,
so while we spent,

700
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,719
we've spent a lot of our time talking about Quiro as an IDE.

701
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:18,599
We want to,

702
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,849
you could put this agent in a terminal as well for those

703
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:23,949
of you who sit in a shell and troubleshoot and write software,

704
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,449
that's a very natural place to be.

705
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,140
It's,

706
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,829
um,
so that's what you get with Quiro CLI.

707
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,729
You get the power of Quiro agents in your favorite terminal.

708
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,969
You can put it in any one.

709
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,829
you use them in a couple.

710
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,569
The Quiro CLI carries over your context,

711
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,400
your steering files,

712
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,630
and MCP configurations from the IDE.

713
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,510
It helps you shift with precision from prompt to deployment in your terminal.

714
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,099
And you get the simplicity and elegance of the terminal,

715
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:50,349
and I assure you it's not a light saber,

716
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,900
although I wish it was.

717
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,359
Um,
so anyway,

718
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,380
terminals

719
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,099
are

720
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,479
an environment that some of the most successful

721
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,719
developers that I have worked with using AI

722
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:01,599
like to use,

723
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,920
and Quiro CLI gives them the power to get there.

724
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,550
Kiro CLI uses the information across your entire code base.

725
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,329
It helps you build features in complex code bases.

726
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,709
You can automate workflows in seconds,

727
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,160
analyze errors,

728
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:17,810
trace bugs,

729
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,719
adjust fixes,

730
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,550
and

731
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,630
what you're doing in the terminal is driving this highly interactive loop

732
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,290
at the back.

733
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:23,969
There's an agent.

734
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,469
The keyro agent happens to be written

735
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,449
in strands,

736
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,969
so you drive this agentic loop,

737
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,109
and the CLI is just a very

738
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,530
easy place to do it.

739
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,810
And since you are in a CLI,

740
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,010
you can use automation scripts.

741
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,130
You can automate all of this.

742
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,989
You can automate shell commands that invoke the CLI with the right context

743
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,890
to automatically execute prompts.

744
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,030
So if you want to troubleshoot a production failure

745
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:46,510
or generate and publish pull requests,

746
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,000
and when your task requires you to get back in the flow,

747
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,810
you can jump right back into your terminal,

748
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,170
and Q Kiro will adapt to your feedback in real time.

749
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,050
It also helps you paralyze agentic tasks really quickly.

750
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,839
Because you have 5 problems,

751
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,439
10 problems,

752
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,459
you can just send

753
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,859
a bunch of agents to try and solve those.

754
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,839
You can also manage projects using something called custom agents.

755
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:10,810
You can create an agent

756
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,739
that is tailored to a specific task,

757
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,680
so you can put a set of your custom prompts,

758
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,930
your context files,

759
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:17,390
tool permissions all together

760
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,040
and create a custom agent,

761
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:19,869
for example,

762
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,449
one that loves doing backend coding,

763
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:23,609
while another custom agent can do front-end work.

764
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,250
And this is where some of this parallelization can get really cool.

765
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,969
You can run 3 of these in parallel one doing front-end work,

766
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,010
one doing back-end work,

767
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,949
and 1 may be doing some other

768
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,949
helper tasks

769
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,770
that go and solve some other problem.

770
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,660
And these

771
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,119
custom agents allow Quiro to become an expert in a specific area.

772
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,920
They don't require any reputation.

773
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
They don't risk context degradation.

774
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:43,969
And

775
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,119
you can work at any scale.

776
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:49,180
You could be doing just simple bash commands or some really complex workflow

777
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:52,180
or running 20 of these agents in parallel all night.

778
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,219
So

779
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,660
it's lightning fast and super powerful.

780
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,390
So

781
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:01,589
Las Vegas is really dry.

782
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,010
I've been talking for too long,

783
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,910
so it's time to see all of this in action.

784
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm sure all of you want to.

785
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,589
And who better to show you

786
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,530
than Brooke Jamison.

787
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:09,489
Welcome,
Brooke.

788
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,109
Thank you.

789
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:23,189
I've built this serverless e-commerce store on AWS.

790
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,609
We've got Dynamo DB,

791
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,310
Lambda,

792
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,479
API Gateway,

793
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,319
the works.

794
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:30,239
But right now it's just placeholder products.

795
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,130
I have real product photos and descriptions for the

796
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,989
Quiro merch I want to put in the store,

797
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,209
and I need to get this production ready.

798
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,329
Hero works however you work.

799
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,520
In the IDE or in the terminal,

800
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:42,709
let me show you both.

801
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:43,689
First,

802
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:46,790
I'll use Vive in the IDE to visualize the architecture.

803
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,959
Kiro is reading my infrastructure files and using the AWS

804
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:54,880
diagram's MCP server to generate the cloud architecture diagram.

805
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,560
We've got lambda functions,

806
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,520
Dynamo DB,

807
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,319
S3,

808
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,420
and cloud front.

809
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,500
Now,

810
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,500
I need some product descriptions.

811
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,760
I put some vague descriptions of things and a style guide in this repo.

812
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,160
Kiro is now reading my style guide,

813
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,709
checking the available photos,

814
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,839
and generating on-brand product descriptions for my store.

815
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,410
Now it's time to optimize those product images,

816
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,219
and some of you prefer the terminal,

817
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,859
so here's Kiro CLI.

818
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,459
Similar capabilities,

819
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,680
different interface.

820
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,369
I'll ask it to resize all my product photos for the website.

821
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,699
Keep the proportions,

822
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,000
make the grid consistent,

823
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,819
optimized for fast loading.

824
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,579
Hero's created a note script with Sharp,

825
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,160
installing dependencies,

826
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,790
processing 38 images to WebP at 2 sizes,

827
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:42,189
full resolution and thumbnails.

828
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,109
Same intelligent assistance,

829
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:45,650
just in your terminal.

830
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,930
Now we're done and all images are optimized.

831
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,300
Now for the complex work,

832
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,790
replacing all those praise holder products with actual merch.

833
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:59,030
This touches the backend data layer,

834
00:27:59,229 --> 00:27:59,869
seed script,

835
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,540
and front-end components.

836
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:03,349
For structured development like this,

837
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,089
I'll switch to Opus 4.5 and use spec mode in the IDE.

838
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:08,780
I'll tell it what I need.

839
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,089
Put my actual products in the store.

840
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:13,089
I've got photos and descriptions ready.

841
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:14,530
Let's get ready for production.

842
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:17,569
Spec mode starts by generating requirements,

843
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,630
and it's breaking down what needs to happen.

844
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,630
Updating the backend to handle multiple product images,

845
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,609
modifying those screen scripts to use my real data,

846
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:29,130
and updating front-end components for the new product structure.

847
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,290
Now it's creating the technical design.

848
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,969
Here's what makes spec mode powerful.

849
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,500
It defines eight correctness properties,

850
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,300
not just does it work,

851
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,609
but formal properties like for any product configuration,

852
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,619
the seed script produces identical results,

853
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,969
or all S3 objects must have correct metadata headers.

854
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,589
Each of these becomes a property-based test later on.

855
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,170
Now,

856
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,540
the implementation plan.

857
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,689
We have 10 tasks broken into subtasks.

858
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,969
Each task maps back to the requirements and design.

859
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,810
I'm making

860
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,170
all tasks required so we can build this comprehensively.

861
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,390
Let's watch it work and starting with task one.

862
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,839
This is creating the product configuration file.

863
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,270
Spec mode reads my product descriptions,

864
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:21,680
maps the image parts from the optimized images folder,

865
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:22,979
sets the pricing,

866
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,300
validates everything,

867
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,540
and creates the JSON config.

868
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:27,839
Task complete,

869
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,599
so now onto task two.

870
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:34,119
This updates the data access layer to handle multiple images per product,

871
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:35,680
and here's the key part,

872
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,760
it writes a property-based test.

873
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,410
This test doesn't just check one product,

874
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,400
it validates that all required fields are present

875
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,369
across 100 randomly generated scenarios with different IDs,

876
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:48,250
categories,

877
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,729
and data structures.

878
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:50,660
Now,

879
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,890
I'll jump ahead to show you something important.

880
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,859
Task 9,

881
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:55,079
the final verification.

882
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:59,209
Task 9 writes two critical property-based tests.

883
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:02,119
Property 7 tests seed reproducibility.

884
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:05,739
It validates that if I reset the database and reseed it,

885
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:08,520
I get identical results every time.

886
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,839
Property 8 tests configuration-driven pricing.

887
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:15,689
It verifies that when I change prices in my config file,

888
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,199
those changes are reflected correctly in the seeded products.

889
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,239
These aren't just testing one scenario.

890
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,739
Each property test runs 100 iterations with randomly generated data.

891
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:30,520
That's 200 test cases just in this task

892
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,739
validating that our system behaves correctly under all conditions.

893
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,829
By the end,

894
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,260
we have 8 property-based tests covering everything.

895
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,520
And now all tasks are complete,

896
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,989
all tests are passing.

897
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,280
Here's the live store,

898
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:48,650
we've got real products,

899
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,040
new categories and optimized images,

900
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:53,650
multiple images with thumbnail validation.

901
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,609
But wait.

902
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,410
This image is a bit cut-off,

903
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,709
so let's go back to Vibe for a quick fix.

904
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,079
Hero analyses the screenshot I pasted in,

905
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:04,489
finds the component,

906
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:07,489
identifies the issue which was some wrong CSS

907
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:09,489
and some bullet points that needed passing.

908
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:10,819
Now,

909
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:11,520
it's fixed,

910
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,790
so work however you work.

911
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:17,319
Vibe in the IDE for exploration and quick fixes.

912
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,640
CLI if you live in a terminal,

913
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,260
and spec mode for structured development with property-based testing.

914
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,540
From architecture diagram to production ready store,

915
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,660
that's Kiro.

916
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,439
Back to you,

917
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:28,939
Deepak.

918
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,020
Please.

919
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,630
Thanks,
Brooke.

920
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,060
I wanted to share

921
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:44,270
a remarkable story.

922
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,920
You've probably heard it a few times this week,

923
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,310
but I'm going to share it again anyway,

924
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,739
of how one of our AWS teams completely transformed the development process

925
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:53,160
using Kiro CLI.

926
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,040
So when Anthony Liguri,

927
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,979
who's a distinguished engineer at AWS,

928
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:58,599
was,

929
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:01,680
he was asked to rebuild the inference engine for Amazon Bedrock,

930
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:05,739
and the initial estimates were that it would take a team of say 30 developers,

931
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,949
12 to 18 months

932
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,800
to go build this very critical component of bedrock.

933
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:10,959
The team

934
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,160
knew that

935
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,560
12 to 18 months

936
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:14,400
was not

937
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:15,160
going to be

938
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,739
quick enough.

939
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:16,770
They wanted to do it much,

940
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,540
much faster.

941
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,900
And

942
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,979
they also knew that adding more developers is not going to help them at all,

943
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,119
that there's a law of diminishing returns,

944
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:27,739
so they wanted to think about a different way to go solve this problem,

945
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:28,800
and

946
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,449
they did that,

947
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
and they did that.

948
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,579
They wanted to do that without

949
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,910
compromising the quality or reliability of the system

950
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,390
because this is such a critical component.

951
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,619
And so they went to KOCLI to assist with their development.

952
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,439
And

953
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:44,719
the results were absolutely remarkable.

954
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:49,119
A team of just 6 people was able to deliver in 76 days

955
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,729
what had originally been estimated to take 30 people 12 to 18 months.

956
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,439
The individual productivity for developers jumped 20x on that team.

957
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,250
Your weekly code comments,

958
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,219
they started off,

959
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,010
you know,
when,

960
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,280
when you're doing a traditional approach,

961
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:05,680
where 2 check-ins per developer went to

962
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,920
over 40

963
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:08,219
check-ins per developer.

964
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:08,890
On average,

965
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:10,800
there were some folks on the team doing even more.

966
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,790
And

967
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,550
it wasn't just about the numbers,

968
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,089
the way they were collaborating,

969
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,000
the way they were building,

970
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,430
the techniques that they built

971
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:18,349
were,

972
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,430
were fabulous,

973
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:19,890
and

974
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,530
they all had fun doing it.

975
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,430
The,
the

976
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,390
job satisfaction ratings on the team

977
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:26,229
were

978
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:28,790
were exceptional because they could use their AI

979
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,349
to handle routine tasks,

980
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,949
and the developers worked with

981
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:32,969
Quiro CLI

982
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,949
to solve the most intricate and hard and strategic problems that they had,

983
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:38,109
but.

984
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,310
It didn't happen overnight.

985
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:44,189
Initially they used it the way a lot of people use AI agents,

986
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,739
very discreet tasks.

987
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,069
Just,

988
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,069
you know,
working with an agent,

989
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,109
giving it some work to do,

990
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:49,869
seeing what happened,

991
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,109
coming back to it.

992
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,410
The real breakthrough came

993
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,650
when they fundamentally redesigned the workflow built around

994
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,310
the AI capabilities as opposed to bringing

995
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,750
the AI capabilities into the existing workflows.

996
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:02,369
So they discovered

997
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,989
three critical patterns.

998
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:06,540
That would result in this exponential improvement.

999
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,800
The first one was

1000
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,500
they moved from task to task supervision to goal-driven direction.

1001
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,070
Their job was to give

1002
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,438
the agent the goals

1003
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,840
that they wanted to accomplish

1004
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,770
and then providing all the supporting information,

1005
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,100
your steering files,

1006
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,060
assistance,

1007
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:21,739
you know,

1008
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,840
what they should be doing,

1009
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,438
providing better prompts to make sure that the agent was able to do it.

1010
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:31,290
Then they scaled out to a number of concurrent AI tasks to increase velocity.

1011
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,918
I talked about custom agents earlier.

1012
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,560
They were unleashing swarms of custom agents

1013
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:36,590
often overnight

1014
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,080
to go solve these problems,

1015
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,418
and when they came back in the morning,

1016
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,719
they would then go and review the changes that had happened.

1017
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,918
And finally

1018
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,958
they were able to extend this AI beyond coding

1019
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,820
to every aspect of what they did,

1020
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,080
from how they talked to each,

1021
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,340
how they worked with each other,

1022
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,639
how they collaborated,

1023
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,219
to every part of the software delivery process.

1024
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,550
And that is what allowed them to achieve the

1025
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,689
level of productivity that we were talking about.

1026
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,959
They went from cautious experimentation

1027
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,840
and

1028
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:04,600
started seeing massive gains,

1029
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:07,360
and this is something that we've seen not just with this team,

1030
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,080
but with many other teams that have learned these lessons.

1031
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:11,979
So as they mastered those patterns,

1032
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,350
the development velocity basically went from,

1033
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,500
you know,

1034
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,000
somewhat

1035
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,560
more than 10 to 15%

1036
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,699
we had talked,

1037
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,760
talked about earlier

1038
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,699
to the 5x,

1039
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:21,129
10x,

1040
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:23,580
20x that this team is getting right now.

1041
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,580
You've heard me say this a few times now.

1042
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:30,870
You only get those levels of gains if you change the way you

1043
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,379
build around the agents as opposed to applying the agents and getting them to

1044
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,300
Add to the work that you're already doing today.

1045
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,280
Even small teams can dramatically outperform traditional approaches,

1046
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,580
so your developers can do a lot more.

1047
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,179
They can actually do things they may have been putting aside for the last 10 years

1048
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,850
because it'll just take a week and they don't have the time.

1049
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Now you can go ahead and do it,

1050
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,620
and you see examples of that every day.

1051
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:57,229
The Quiro demonstrates what's possible when

1052
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:59,290
developers have access to powerful agents,

1053
00:35:59,629 --> 00:36:00,669
but even with this foundation,

1054
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,510
agents don't automatically know how to use every tool out there.

1055
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,379
They don't know how to use every tool correctly.

1056
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,620
You don't know how to exactly work with an MCP server,

1057
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:10,280
for example,

1058
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,709
where they are translating a design to implementation,

1059
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,350
handling some security pattern,

1060
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:16,010
managing a deployment,

1061
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,189
making them less effective without constant human guidance.

1062
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,949
These are all lessons you have to learn.

1063
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,090
So we started asking ourselves,

1064
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,530
How can we help?

1065
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,719
What can we do?

1066
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,739
How can we capture these knowledge and best

1067
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:30,100
practices that are often scattered across people,

1068
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:31,500
documentation,

1069
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,399
uh,

1070
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,110
wikis,

1071
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:34,340
a blog post somewhere,

1072
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:35,560
or YouTube video somewhere?

1073
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,729
So it makes it difficult for AI agents to

1074
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,350
access the relevant information to get the right context.

1075
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,750
MCP

1076
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:44,909
provides connectivity to development tools,

1077
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,800
but there's additional configuration required.

1078
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,729
You often have to write really good steering files.

1079
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,709
You have to write hooks

1080
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:53,050
so that you can get the right level and quality of code at the end,

1081
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,290
otherwise you'll have to refactor like crazy.

1082
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:59,540
So developers need their agents to work with the tools they use every day.

1083
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,600
And we started thinking about how we could help,

1084
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,699
how we can make these tool connections really work for them without

1085
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,969
overloading context.

1086
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:07,889
And you know,

1087
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,929
so rather than leaving developers to figure out the right context,

1088
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,280
you know,
through trial and error,

1089
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,709
we came up with this idea

1090
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,070
of Quiro Powers.

1091
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:19,129
And what we've done is come up with a system that you can build your own powers,

1092
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,389
but we also worked with a bunch of top technology providers

1093
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,909
and tool creators to

1094
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:28,520
build the first version of Quiro Powers which launched yesterday.

1095
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,010
You can start using it right away.

1096
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,159
They extend sort of the core purpose of Quiro

1097
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:36,100
by enabling developers to bring structure to AI,

1098
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,729
which is what we started off with.

1099
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,479
But now you can give the Quiro agents specialized capabilities or powers on demand

1100
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,860
as you need it across the entire software stack.

1101
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,070
So what is the power?

1102
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:47,419
It is a package set.

1103
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:51,784
Of artifacts in this particular case created by a set of tool vendors,

1104
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:54,155
but you can also create your own artifacts

1105
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,294
MCP servers,

1106
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:56,054
steering files,

1107
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:56,715
and hooks.

1108
00:37:57,094 --> 00:38:01,594
They're bundled usually around a specific domain such as backend development or UI

1109
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:02,534
or

1110
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,415
observability or API design.

1111
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,260
And we've also done it in a way

1112
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,149
that instead of relying on generic agents and overloading with documentation,

1113
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,280
we dynamically load the context and exact tool access,

1114
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,139
so the way you go through your credits and tokens are also a lot more efficient.

1115
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,500
This is available inside the IDE right now.

1116
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,199
It'll come into the CLI soon,

1117
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,979
and we are working on ways to make it available to any ID or CLI that you may be using.

1118
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,780
You don't have to use just Quiro

1119
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,239
with Quiro powers.

1120
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:35,060
So each power is designed in collaboration with a set of domain and tool providers.

1121
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,560
Here

1122
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,899
you have a set of names.

1123
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,909
It also includes,

1124
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,209
uh,
which is Hashi Corp,

1125
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,929
and these are for,

1126
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,840
you know,
areas like UI design with Figma,

1127
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:44,879
backend deployment,

1128
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,120
development with Superbase.

1129
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:46,899
You can

1130
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,199
have a power for Stripe.

1131
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,699
You can build a full application

1132
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,100
all the way

1133
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,500
using these powers,

1134
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:53,679
um.

1135
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:58,189
You can customize each power to match your organization's requirements.

1136
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,290
You can actually go in and

1137
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,830
make modifications.

1138
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,370
You can stack multiple powers together to create sort of enhanced capabilities.

1139
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:06,149
For example,

1140
00:39:06,149 --> 00:39:09,370
you can use the stripe power with the data dog power or DynaTrace

1141
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,169
to build a new payments application

1142
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,010
with observability on performance and security.

1143
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,969
You can create and share new powers with other people,

1144
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:17,489
and

1145
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:18,050
Uh,

1146
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,790
just looking at Twitter since yesterday,

1147
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,070
we've,
I've already seen people creating a bunch of powers that they can use

1148
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,790
and they're sharing with the rest of the community.

1149
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,090
Let's see this in action.

1150
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:29,030
So we're going to use the kito power from DataDog.

1151
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,320
To set up telemetry on a front-end application for real-time

1152
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,500
user monitoring,

1153
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:35,860
so ROM as they call it.

1154
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,229
Once this power has been installed,

1155
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,469
we're going to activate the power in a new session.

1156
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:42,000
And

1157
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,500
once we are up and running,

1158
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:46,719
you're going to ask Quiro to add client-site logic to our application

1159
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,590
in order to start tracking these rum metrics.

1160
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:50,620
So in my setup,

1161
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:52,560
I also need to provide an environment,

1162
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,540
uh,

1163
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,899
that to set up,

1164
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:55,919
uh,

1165
00:39:56,179 --> 00:39:58,620
to provide a set of environmental variables to my application.

1166
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,879
Once this is configured,

1167
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,479
DataDog will generate events whenever somebody clicks on a

1168
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,379
button or adds new products to the cart.

1169
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,189
But guess what?

1170
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,830
We are starting to see some errors popping up.

1171
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,620
OK,

1172
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,439
that's what DataDog is supposed to show you.

1173
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,620
You check them out

1174
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,659
and you see that the add to cart

1175
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,879
page is causing an error.

1176
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,620
So you want to quickly resolve this issue.

1177
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So you ask Kiro to fetch these rum events that

1178
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,020
have errors and ask Kiro to suggest a fix,

1179
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,760
and Quiro will review the errors,

1180
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,540
determine that the errors are due to the due to a required host name configuration

1181
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,030
for external images.

1182
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,199
It'll apply the fix,

1183
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,419
resolve the issue with the add to cart page,

1184
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,179
and

1185
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,600
Voila.

1186
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,340
You have the new,

1187
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,040
you have the,

1188
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,620
you have a fixed page

1189
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:41,360
with

1190
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,699
using the keto power.

1191
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,330
We are actually using Quiro to build Quiro.

1192
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:45,949
We do that.

1193
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:47,340
We've been doing that from day one.

1194
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:48,929
Quiro Paws is one example.

1195
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:51,070
All of Quiro Powers was built

1196
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,429
using specs

1197
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,669
by the Quiro team.

1198
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:54,770
From,

1199
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,270
you know,

1200
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,729
core capabilities like system notifications,

1201
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,010
error handling were all developed purely through specs,

1202
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,270
often in less than a week.

1203
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,709
One example

1204
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,110
from very recently

1205
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,530
is how we use Quiro to build its own caching system.

1206
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,199
We built a specialized analysis tool

1207
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:14,479
using Quiro that reduced triage time from 2 hours to a couple of minutes.

1208
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:16,419
Most importantly,

1209
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,899
because we built this caching system,

1210
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,239
our reduction in,

1211
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,060
we had a 72% reduction in infrastructure costs,

1212
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,239
and all of this was done over a weekend.

1213
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:25,909
This kind of rapid,

1214
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:28,300
sort of purpose-built solution development represents the

1215
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,100
power of spectrum and development in action.

1216
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,330
And

1217
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:34,860
building Qiro with Quiro was a way for us to learn how we could get

1218
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,260
insights into what the transformation could be,

1219
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,469
and we'll continue to add capabilities like

1220
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,510
Quiro powers that help the Quiro agent

1221
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,330
be that much more effective for the things

1222
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,290
you want to do.

1223
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,760
These lessons are super important.

1224
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,060
AI agents are changing at a rapid pace.

1225
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:50,000
New models come out.

1226
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:51,169
New science comes out.

1227
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,610
They increasingly grow more powerful because you can do more reasoning.

1228
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:58,159
You can handle significantly more complex work autonomously

1229
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,659
because of better context windows and better tool handling,

1230
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:02,639
and

1231
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,439
agents

1232
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,179
are constantly analyzing code.

1233
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,379
They're optimizing performance.

1234
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:07,540
They're flagging issues.

1235
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,000
You saw this example of the parallel execution that the

1236
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:12,229
Bedrock team was doing.

1237
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:13,229
But

1238
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,139
they're also actively collaborating with

1239
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,459
developers in real time.

1240
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,310
So

1241
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
you have this fluidity of AI agents.

1242
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,060
You're

1243
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:20,639
working,

1244
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,780
you start off your day by working with an agent

1245
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,179
in front of a terminal

1246
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:25,689
or in front of an IDE,

1247
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,120
and you start assigning tasks to the AI in

1248
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,419
the background while you work with the AI tasks

1249
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,250
on the things that you want to do.

1250
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,520
And the background task could be anything from security

1251
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,000
scanning and dependency updates to architecture and implementation.

1252
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:41,560
We wanted to capture

1253
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:43,479
some of these practices in

1254
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,199
which a lot of developers are starting to learn by hand and implementing

1255
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:48,800
as products

1256
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:50,060
within Quiro.

1257
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:53,800
So earlier this week we introduced 3 new frontier agents that represent

1258
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:54,739
in our,

1259
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:55,659
in our belief,

1260
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,040
a major leap forward in AI power development.

1261
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:00,050
So what is a frontier agent?

1262
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,219
There are a new class of AI agents that

1263
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,320
are offered by AWS.

1264
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:04,719
They have a few defining traits.

1265
00:43:05,129 --> 00:43:05,570
One,

1266
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,459
they're autonomous.

1267
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:08,320
You direct them towards a goal,

1268
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,409
and they figure out how to achieve it without you having to constantly prompt it.

1269
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,030
They need to be able to figure out

1270
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,709
what they even need to go do.

1271
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:16,330
They're massively scalable.

1272
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:18,290
We've talked about scalability being one of the

1273
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,149
key lessons that the Bedrock team learned.

1274
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:23,610
How can we make that kind of capability available to everybody?

1275
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,570
The autonomous agents allow you to do that.

1276
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,959
They're able to perform multiple concurrent tasks

1277
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,429
and distribute work across agents automatically,

1278
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,340
and they work independently,

1279
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,510
sometimes for hours to days

1280
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,489
without intervention.

1281
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:36,629
That is a key capability.

1282
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,189
I'm going to mostly talk about the Kro

1283
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:42,090
Autonomous agent because that's for software development.

1284
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,469
It helps you ship more product more quickly,

1285
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:46,110
focus on the highest value tasks,

1286
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:47,169
so you can assign

1287
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:50,489
all your refactoring tasks and your P3 tasks to it.

1288
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,939
The security agent is an application security

1289
00:43:52,939 --> 00:43:54,850
agent that's constantly scanning your code.

1290
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:56,649
It's also doing penetration testing.

1291
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:58,850
The DevOps agent does incident response.

1292
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:00,340
It prevents future incidents,

1293
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,689
and it's again constantly scanning your code

1294
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,209
in case you have new lessons that you need to apply

1295
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,149
to existing applications to make sure you are running,

1296
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:08,090
operating safely.

1297
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,110
So

1298
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:12,000
With these frontier agents you're no longer just

1299
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,399
being collaborative with a developer always sitting.

1300
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,350
You can deliver complete outcomes.

1301
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:18,360
You can add them as extensions to your team.

1302
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,409
You're going to operate in a way again,

1303
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,139
this is a new way of working

1304
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,459
where you are basically saying there's this,

1305
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,080
there's a team,

1306
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,560
there's a teammate that you have that can help you

1307
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,179
as a team move much faster or as an individual.

1308
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:33,479
So let's dive deeper into the key autonomous agent.

1309
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:36,449
So this agent works with developers and with teams.

1310
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,570
It autonomously handles development work.

1311
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,320
So

1312
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:40,709
one of the first things it does

1313
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,939
is it's constantly running.

1314
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,080
It's running all the time,

1315
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:44,600
building a comprehensive

1316
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,939
understanding of your code base and patterns,

1317
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:49,739
and it learns from your code reviews to improve with every task.

1318
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,919
So every interaction

1319
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,060
you have with the autonomous agent

1320
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:53,939
makes it smarter,

1321
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:55,139
makes it more capable.

1322
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,330
So

1323
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,310
you know,

1324
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,550
typically with an AI assistant,

1325
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,449
including the ones that we've talked about today,

1326
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:02,189
you're actively managing context,

1327
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:02,790
and

1328
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,629
you know that's the learning,

1329
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:04,949
that's the craft that you have to learn.

1330
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:07,889
You have to constantly re-explain your preference or pattern.

1331
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,070
You have to build a system to show,

1332
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,370
to share context across repositories,

1333
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,709
and they're almost always session-based.

1334
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:16,030
Once you close a session,

1335
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:17,709
the agent forgets about everything,

1336
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,090
and next time you start a session,

1337
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,409
it needs to remember.

1338
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,080
Kiro Autonomous agent is not session-based.

1339
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:25,169
It's always available.

1340
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,310
It maintains context across all your work.

1341
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,340
It's sort of running alongside you and your team workflows,

1342
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,229
so it constantly maintains context

1343
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,060
and automates development tasks,

1344
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,449
so you don't have to stop and slow down to tell it something.

1345
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,629
It's constantly going.

1346
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,010
It can tackle a full range of activities,

1347
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,280
so you can use it to develop new features.

1348
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,629
You can use it to triage bugs to improve your code coverage,

1349
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:47,949
and all of this happens in the background.

1350
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,000
You,

1351
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,959
you know,
you point it to your issue backlog

1352
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,020
and give it some tasks,

1353
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:53,649
so you keep doing what you need to do,

1354
00:45:53,939 --> 00:45:55,399
and the autonomous agent will

1355
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,520
do what you asked it to do in the background.

1356
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:00,639
It connects to tools you already use Jira,

1357
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:01,399
GitHub,

1358
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:02,060
Slack

1359
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:03,020
in the team's version,

1360
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:04,659
GitHub in the individual version

1361
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:06,739
to build a shared understanding of your work.

1362
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,939
So if you're part of a team,

1363
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,459
it's actually learning from Slack.

1364
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,439
It's learning

1365
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:11,699
from your GitHub interactions.

1366
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,159
It's learning from your backlog.

1367
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,120
And

1368
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,899
one of the coolest thing is,

1369
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,080
and I think this is

1370
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,600
probably my favorite part of autonomous agents.

1371
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,669
On day 30 it's going to be more effective than it was on day 1.

1372
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,530
On day 60,

1373
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,030
it's going to be more effective than it was on day

1374
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,419
30 because it continues to deepen its understanding of your code,

1375
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,149
your products,

1376
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,010
and the standards

1377
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:33,030
your team follows.

1378
00:46:33,149 --> 00:46:34,030
So let's see it in action.

1379
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:36,189
So

1380
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:37,729
you saw the Quiro Swag store.

1381
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,489
It's grown,

1382
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,520
and you want a simple way to save your favorite items.

1383
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,649
So if you want to add a wish list experience.

1384
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:44,800
So on GitHub,

1385
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:46,110
all you need to do

1386
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,989
is add the Quiro label

1387
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:49,070
to

1388
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,189
to your issue and hand this off.

1389
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,330
And the moment you do that,

1390
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,580
it hands it off to Quiro,

1391
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:54,969
and the agent takes over.

1392
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,530
It immediately creates the task,

1393
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,169
pulls the entire issue context,

1394
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,129
and starts preparing a sandbox.

1395
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:02,270
Everything you do runs in the sandbox,

1396
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,449
and after a quick analysis,

1397
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:05,050
it proposes a clear plan

1398
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:06,610
and a breakdown of this task.

1399
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:08,270
It already,

1400
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:09,389
you don't have to tell it anything.

1401
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:11,429
It already understands how this change should thread

1402
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,770
through the stack because it's built that understanding.

1403
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,050
And then the agent will go and validate the plan.

1404
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,290
It'll analyze the repo.

1405
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,639
It'll make sure there's enough context to proceed,

1406
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,750
otherwise they'll ask you for help.

1407
00:47:22,629 --> 00:47:24,060
It then explores the project.

1408
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:25,149
It maps the back end,

1409
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,149
maps the front end.

1410
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,899
It looks through your handlers.

1411
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:29,469
It looks through your API config,

1412
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,800
your data model,

1413
00:47:31,189 --> 00:47:33,320
and it aligns itself with the approach that,

1414
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:35,270
you know,
it knows how the system was built,

1415
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:38,330
so it's going to align its approach to the way the system was built,

1416
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,409
and it runs the change end to end.

1417
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,510
It updates data access for the wish list.

1418
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:44,149
It hooks it into the product page.

1419
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:46,639
It keeps the UI and backend logic consistent

1420
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,330
with the patterns that you're already using.

1421
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:49,429
It runs tests,

1422
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,610
validates behavior.

1423
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:52,149
Checks type safety.

1424
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:54,850
It ensures the agent integrates properly and cleanly,

1425
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:55,810
and then

1426
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,110
you get a clean pull request.

1427
00:47:57,169 --> 00:47:58,090
You get a diff

1428
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,070
and a clear summary of what changed.

1429
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,330
And since the agent is not session-based,

1430
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,050
it doesn't forget.

1431
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,370
So when you give it feedback on one pull request,

1432
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,030
it'll automatically apply the

1433
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,310
learning to the next 10.

1434
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:10,800
So back in the store,

1435
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,739
you have your wish list.

1436
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,189
Users can now tap the heart.

1437
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,689
You can save your favorite item,

1438
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,580
and we track how many people love each product

1439
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:18,379
and

1440
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,169
You can go

1441
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,949
even faster.

1442
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,790
You can parallellyze all of this.

1443
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,370
In fact,

1444
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
the agent itself will figure out how to paralyze all of it,

1445
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,060
each with its own context.

1446
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:29,709
So let's say you're implementing a new wish list feature.

1447
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,290
Kiro can also go fix a bug over here that you found last night

1448
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:34,510
or solve another,

1449
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,050
you know,
do a refactoring over here.

1450
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:37,429
All of this,

1451
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,300
we believe,

1452
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,949
is the next phase of AI development,

1453
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,929
increasing the velocity and scope of work that can get done by an individual

1454
00:48:44,149 --> 00:48:44,790
or a team.

1455
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:48,800
I've had the,

1456
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:50,939
you know,
we've seen how customers have been using

1457
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:53,919
AI assistance over the last couple of years.

1458
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:54,649
Um,

1459
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,780
they've gone from pilot to production,

1460
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:00,659
discovering ways that AI can fundamentally change how their teams work

1461
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,780
across the entire development life cycle.

1462
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:04,600
And one of the people I've,

1463
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,040
we've been lucky to see this with is Brittany Doncaster,

1464
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,459
who's the chief architect at Delta,

1465
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,520
and she's here to share their transformation story.

1466
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,520
Welcome,
Brittany.

1467
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,760
Thank you.

1468
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:19,699
Thank you,

1469
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:20,300
Deepak.

1470
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,699
I'm so excited to be here and I'm even more excited to share with

1471
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,949
you all Delta's journey and incorporating G

1472
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,659
Gen AI into our software development practices.

1473
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,899
We all know

1474
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,540
that Gen AI is transforming how we build

1475
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:36,310
and how we deliver software,

1476
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,320
and we all want to do it faster.

1477
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:40,280
At Delta,

1478
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:41,020
we

1479
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:42,469
delight in

1480
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,800
our customers experiencing delight,

1481
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,050
and we want to build software that delights our customers.

1482
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,590
And so we've been on a journey

1483
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:51,790
to do that

1484
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,449
quicker using Gen AI.

1485
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,250
But introducing

1486
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:57,709
coding assistants

1487
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:58,969
just isn't enough.

1488
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,379
And if we look at why that is.

1489
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,429
Everybody's been focusing on just developers

1490
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,110
and

1491
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,000
giving developers coding assistance and Gen AI coding tools

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,149
and agentic coding tools and all these things,

1493
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,409
but at the end of the day,

1494
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,709
developers are only one piece of the puzzle,

1495
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:21,870
and a lot of developers across the industry only spend about

1496
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,590
30% of their time

1497
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,000
actually developing.

1498
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,409
And so if you optimize that 30%,

1499
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:28,409
that's great,

1500
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:33,090
but you're not gonna see end to end improvements across the life cycle.

1501
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:37,229
And so we've started looking beyond the tools to our processes.

1502
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:40,879
And here at Delta,

1503
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,580
we have taken a dual path approach.

1504
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,139
On the first path,

1505
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:50,189
we're taking our existing product development life cycle or our PDLC as we call it,

1506
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,820
and we're infusing AI into that

1507
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,709
PDLC process.

1508
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,219
We're trying to do that in a way that makes it natural for folks

1509
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,080
across the activities that they already do today.

1510
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:05,500
And so we want to do that with as little change as possible

1511
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,320
and really just smoothing out the transitions,

1512
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,709
helping them have better data when they're making decisions,

1513
00:51:11,879 --> 00:51:14,560
and trying to automate the processes that exist today.

1514
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:16,439
But then,

1515
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,889
we know that's only gonna get us so far.

1516
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:21,709
To really get that next level of speed.

1517
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,310
We're gonna take that PDLC

1518
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,159
and we're gonna chuck it out the window

1519
00:51:26,979 --> 00:51:30,510
and we're gonna reimagine what a PDLC could look like

1520
00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:33,439
given the tools that we have at our disposal today

1521
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,060
given Quiro

1522
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:38,270
that we've been utilizing from AWS and Quiro CLI

1523
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:40,919
and we're gonna look and see

1524
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,360
what happens

1525
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,040
when we forget what we think we know

1526
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,500
about product delivery.

1527
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,909
The reason we've done that is because

1528
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,750
change is hard for an enterprise

1529
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:54,469
and change management's difficult.

1530
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:55,750
And so

1531
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,629
we know that we've got to introduce change.

1532
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,350
In a really methodical way.

1533
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:05,820
So let's dig a bit deeper into the first path and talk about

1534
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,899
how we started introducing the change into

1535
00:52:07,899 --> 00:52:10,040
the existing product development life cycle.

1536
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,389
The first thing we knew we had to do

1537
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,879
was that we had to get adoption up

1538
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,689
and we knew we weren't gonna see any changes or any

1539
00:52:17,689 --> 00:52:20,679
difference if we didn't have people actually utilizing the tools.

1540
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,340
So we focused on adoption.

1541
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:24,280
We held launch events,

1542
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,719
we held workshops,

1543
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:28,419
and we went in just a little over 4 months,

1544
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,540
from 6% of our user base

1545
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:33,479
to over 12020%.

1546
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,280
Now for those of you who are sitting there going,

1547
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,100
her math is not mathing.

1548
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:42,100
How do you get over 100% of your users?

1549
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,189
I will tell you.

1550
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:46,330
You get over 100% of your users

1551
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,489
by originally anticipating that only developers are going to utilize the tool.

1552
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,540
Because that's what we thought when we roll out a tool called Q Developer,

1553
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,459
you kind of think that only developers are gonna be the ones utilizing it.

1554
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,260
But as we started to do these trainings

1555
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,800
and workshops and all of the enablement sessions,

1556
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,870
what we ended up seeing was that our technical product owners,

1557
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,320
our business analysts,

1558
00:53:08,439 --> 00:53:10,500
all the people surrounding the developers

1559
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:13,040
actually wanted access to QCLI too.

1560
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:15,020
They also wanted to use it

1561
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:15,929
in

1562
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,560
their process.

1563
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,169
in support of building software

1564
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:22,229
and so we actually ended up partnering with AWS

1565
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:23,929
and bifurcating the training

1566
00:53:24,149 --> 00:53:25,750
and we created a

1567
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:30,850
specific non-developer training with AWS that we could give our non-developers

1568
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:34,350
so that they could utilize the same tool that our developers were utilizing.

1569
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:34,979
Because

1570
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:35,709
at the end of the day,

1571
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:37,149
QCLI and Quiro,

1572
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:39,030
a lot of it is about the context.

1573
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:41,649
And when you're giving the people around the developers

1574
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,020
the same context that the developers have,

1575
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,790
you end up unlocking some,

1576
00:53:46,149 --> 00:53:47,689
some additional savings and

1577
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:48,610
improvements.

1578
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,620
But we quickly had to pivot from adoption to impact.

1579
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:55,610
So

1580
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,790
once we started seeing we have people,

1581
00:53:57,919 --> 00:53:58,520
not just

1582
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,639
we have these users,

1583
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,600
but they're actively using it daily,

1584
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,659
weekly using

1585
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,020
this tool.

1586
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:08,080
We started to look at what the impact of the tool was

1587
00:54:08,439 --> 00:54:09,540
on our metrics.

1588
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,040
Like every other company,

1589
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,780
we have a ton of different metrics for developer productivity,

1590
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,800
and one of those is cycle time,

1591
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,139
but we break that cycle time down into

1592
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:20,080
development time and delivery time.

1593
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,189
And we define development time

1594
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,560
as branch creation to branch merge,

1595
00:54:24,709 --> 00:54:27,590
and delivery time is branch merge to code and production.

1596
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,590
And what we ended up seeing

1597
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,250
was as Q and QCLI adoption increased and became

1598
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,310
daily and weekly usage across our developer landscape,

1599
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,550
we saw our development time go down.

1600
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:42,169
But what we didn't see was our delivery time go down,

1601
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,100
and we didn't see our deployment frequency go up.

1602
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:48,520
And so we could see through our data and our metrics

1603
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,159
that we were coding faster,

1604
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,100
but we weren't delivering faster.

1605
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:54,909
And so we knew we had to go beyond development.

1606
00:54:58,929 --> 00:54:59,929
And so that's what we did.

1607
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:03,310
First we went to the right of development,

1608
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:05,929
and we started looking specifically at delivery

1609
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,949
time because we could tell from our metrics

1610
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,110
that that was our bottleneck.

1611
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,030
That was where we needed to

1612
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:12,850
invest and to optimize.

1613
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:15,469
And so we looked at how could we use

1614
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,530
QCLI

1615
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,709
to optimize and automate the processes that exist there.

1616
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:22,479
How could we utilize it to improve our test automation,

1617
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,810
our integration tests,

1618
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,989
improve some of the things that are

1619
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:29,250
just those paper cuts that hurt and make developers wanna say,

1620
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:29,929
you know what,

1621
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,570
instead of delivering each of these code changes,

1622
00:55:32,649 --> 00:55:34,120
I'm just gonna batch them up

1623
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:36,030
because the process is kind of

1624
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:38,629
maybe not as optimal as it could be

1625
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:41,979
and so we started working on ways to make that more optimal

1626
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:43,129
at the same time.

1627
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:45,820
We listened to our developers and we heard

1628
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,620
that sometimes when they were getting features and stories

1629
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,100
from their product owners

1630
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,439
it wasn't articulated as well as it might could have been

1631
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:57,739
or it wasn't as clear to them what they wanted out of it

1632
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:58,800
and so we started.

1633
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:02,070
Using these tools in order to help us standardize

1634
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:05,149
what is included in a feature in a story

1635
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,909
and what's articulated in those

1636
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:10,979
and then also to help drive more clarity so that there's less churn

1637
00:56:11,129 --> 00:56:13,310
going back and forth between the product owner

1638
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:14,330
and engineering.

1639
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,300
But in order to really change the game,

1640
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:21,149
we know we have to go down our 2nd path.

1641
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,399
And that is why

1642
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,840
we have started

1643
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:25,959
our 2nd path and our 2nd journey.

1644
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:30,719
And the way we're approaching this is we are taking pilot workshops

1645
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,080
and we are breaking down the walls

1646
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,060
of the traditional teams that are part of product delivery.

1647
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,879
We are bringing the product owner and the engineering

1648
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,219
into a workshop

1649
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,899
and we did this recently with one of our product owners and our senior developers

1650
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,300
in um in one of our business units

1651
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,820
and the feedback we got from that product owner

1652
00:56:49,979 --> 00:56:50,580
was that

1653
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,260
it

1654
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,260
took them

1655
00:56:52,439 --> 00:56:54,340
what normally would have taken them

1656
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,560
probably a couple months to do.

1657
00:56:56,899 --> 00:56:57,629
It took them

1658
00:56:58,139 --> 00:56:59,139
a couple days,

1659
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:00,370
really a little less,

1660
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:01,179
a day and a half

1661
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,770
in a workshop,

1662
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,399
and when we start

1663
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:06,719
looking at that kind of savings

1664
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,080
and that kind of speed,

1665
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,830
it really is transformational,

1666
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:11,719
and you have to start to think about

1667
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:13,580
a different kind of process,

1668
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:15,280
a different kind of team structure,

1669
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:17,879
what does product development look like in the future?

1670
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,459
And we don't quite know yet,

1671
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,330
but we know we're gonna keep experimenting,

1672
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,600
we know we're gonna keep collaborating.

1673
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,649
And we know that we're going to use Quiro

1674
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,729
as the enabler for both of these.

1675
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,719
So why does this matter?

1676
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,850
For Delta,

1677
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:41,050
we really want to deliver our products to our customers

1678
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,649
as quickly as we can

1679
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,050
and so we're taking

1680
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,649
on the left hand side

1681
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,290
what we know

1682
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:51,219
it works today and making it more scalable and optimizing it,

1683
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,060
but then we're also innovating.

1684
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,060
And we're doing this so that we can bring you

1685
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,659
the products you love

1686
00:57:57,969 --> 00:57:58,639
faster

1687
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,879
and get more speed.

1688
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,500
But this isn't just about technology.

1689
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,540
This is about positioning Delta for long term success.

1690
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,239
Our roadmap is clear.

1691
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,790
We'll improve today,

1692
00:58:10,169 --> 00:58:11,830
we'll experiment for tomorrow.

1693
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,949
And we'll scale what works.

1694
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,040
Thank you.

1695
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,219
I'll welcome Deepak back to the stage.

1696
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,870
Thank you,
Brittany.

1697
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,830
Delta is an amazing example of how quickly

1698
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,050
agents can help a business grow and thrive.

1699
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:31,540
It doesn't just help the developers build faster,

1700
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:34,530
it helps the builder builders of Delta think

1701
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,389
through entirely new ways of working across the development cycle,

1702
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,939
and they'll continue to evolve.

1703
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:41,590
What makes it possible is this ability of

1704
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,090
humans and agents to work seamlessly together.

1705
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:46,850
So where is all of this going to go?

1706
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:49,020
We have seen examples of the possibilities,

1707
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:51,340
but we've also seen some of the challenges.

1708
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,340
Humans working with agents can ship code 10 times faster than maybe you can do today,

1709
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:59,919
but that's only going to accelerate because of a couple of changes.

1710
00:59:00,149 --> 00:59:02,639
If we can orchestrate multiple agents working together

1711
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,959
and redesign the software delivery processes that we have

1712
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:09,840
from the ground up for a world where multi-agent systems are writing and operating

1713
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,379
a good chunk of our software.

1714
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,580
So

1715
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:15,219
one of the questions we often ask ourselves is,

1716
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:16,889
what is the value of code

1717
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,050
in

1718
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:21,000
as an artifact in a world where humans are working with agents

1719
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,179
and agents are doing most of the code analysis and writing.

1720
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,699
It is easy to imagine an expert

1721
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,120
expert planning agent managing context precisely,

1722
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,159
spinning up agents that implement features,

1723
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,360
review and deploy code,

1724
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,120
optimize performance and cost,

1725
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:36,820
manage operations.

1726
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:39,919
Humans in the loop will continue to be critical.

1727
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,120
Humans provide the level of judgment and intent that nobody else can.

1728
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:45,139
You are the only people who know what you want to build,

1729
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:46,590
but what they do,

1730
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,060
the processes they work within,

1731
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,229
the tools they use,

1732
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,739
the tools we all use,

1733
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,459
are going to look

1734
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,649
completely different

1735
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:53,639
from what we do,

1736
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,679
what we are doing today.

1737
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:57,399
I believe an IDE will evolve into

1738
00:59:57,399 --> 01:00:00,239
a context management and agent orchestration system.

1739
01:00:00,459 --> 01:00:03,639
The SDLC is going to be much more iterative and rapid fire

1740
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,620
than it is today.

1741
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:07,590
And

1742
01:00:07,889 --> 01:00:08,770
as all of that happens,

1743
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,969
we have many open questions.

1744
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,469
How do we make and communicate decisions faster?

1745
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,139
Humans are still involved.

1746
01:00:14,419 --> 01:00:16,600
How do we verify intent matches output?

1747
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,280
How do we make sure that the output

1748
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,419
is verifiable?

1749
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,610
How do we build that trust?

1750
01:00:20,729 --> 01:00:22,399
How do we reduce the blast radius

1751
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,459
of all of these changes,

1752
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,919
because things will continue to break.

1753
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:27,540
The solution looks more like conducting an orchestra

1754
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,520
and less like playing an individual instrument,

1755
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:30,479
or if you're like me,

1756
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,260
a good band.

1757
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:34,149
You still need to understand what good music sounds like,

1758
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:37,500
uh,
and as a band you're responsible for the overall output,

1759
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,479
but you don't have to play each individual instrument yourself.

1760
01:00:42,899 --> 01:00:44,909
And this transformation is not theoretical.

1761
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,020
It is happening right now.

1762
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:48,560
You have seen examples of this throughout this conference.

1763
01:00:49,419 --> 01:00:50,500
Over the next 12 months,

1764
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,639
it's going to dramatically evolve,

1765
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,399
and we are committed to being your partner

1766
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:55,760
throughout this evolution.

1767
01:00:56,379 --> 01:00:59,459
Thriving in this rapidly changing environment requires more than just tools.

1768
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,520
It requires support,

1769
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,639
it requires continuous learning activities.

1770
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,739
And learning is just not about formal training,

1771
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,459
it's about community and connections.

1772
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,330
Learn from the people in this room.

1773
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,280
Learn from the people you see in other talks who are actually doing what

1774
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:13,179
are practicing what they're talking,

1775
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,520
people like Brittany and Delta.

1776
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,010
And that's why we've built one of the

1777
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,540
technology's most vibrant and supportive developer ecosystems.

1778
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,879
And in the case of Quiro,

1779
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:21,889
we have a

1780
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,510
Discord community with more than 14,000 developers,

1781
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:25,969
including of developers of

1782
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,489
all backgrounds and skill sets.

1783
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:30,389
You can also join a local group within Discord.

1784
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:31,070
Ask questions,

1785
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:32,100
exchange ideas,

1786
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:35,360
learn about best practices through local community-led gatherings,

1787
01:01:35,669 --> 01:01:38,169
and I encourage you to join the AWS community,

1788
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:39,419
the Quiro community,

1789
01:01:39,709 --> 01:01:40,729
join a local user group,

1790
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:42,550
connect with community builders,

1791
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,989
discover new ways to learn,

1792
01:01:44,229 --> 01:01:44,590
grow,

1793
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,729
and innovate together,

1794
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,010
and.

1795
01:01:47,419 --> 01:01:48,209
Over the last hour,

1796
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,090
I hope we've shown you that we are the dawn of something extraordinary.

1797
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:51,919
It's not something

1798
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,620
to be afraid of,

1799
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:53,879
it's something to embrace.

1800
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:57,139
The possibilities that we have explored aren't incremental.

1801
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,879
They represent a fundamental shift

1802
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,620
in how all of us are going to imagine,

1803
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,080
create,
and deploy software,

1804
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,179
and we're going to be with you throughout this journey.

1805
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,639
We're going to provide the technology,

1806
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,570
the resources,

1807
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,560
and the support,

1808
01:02:07,899 --> 01:02:10,800
and I'm really excited about the future that's unfolding

1809
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,189
and what we'll achieve together.

1810
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,040
So.

1811
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:14,850
To help you get started,

1812
01:02:14,979 --> 01:02:18,320
we're offering every reinvent attendee 1000 kiro credits.

1813
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,139
And for the startups in this audience,

1814
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:23,239
we're giving away up to 1 year's worth of Quiro Pro tier,

1815
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,830
Kiro Pro Plus tier,

1816
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:27,000
up to 100 seats credits as well

1817
01:02:27,419 --> 01:02:28,340
through the end of the year.

1818
01:02:28,419 --> 01:02:30,179
You can go apply at kiro.gov.

1819
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:31,520
And

1820
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:32,179
thank you,
