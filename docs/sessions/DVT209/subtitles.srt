1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,674
- All right. Two, one.

2
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:04,650
Woo! All right, we can finally start.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,080
But even though you guys have
been here for like 15 minutes,

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,460
it feels like already,

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,280
so you must be really
excited about this session.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,356
But if you've already been using Kiro,

7
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:14,850
I don't know how much of this

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,849
is necessarily gonna be new information

9
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,590
because well, if you're a practitioner

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,700
and you're playing with it daily,

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,790
you're gonna get a lot
of information already.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,758
Also, I bought these
shoes today and if I fall,

13
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:28,504
I want my CSAT scores to
be like super high, okay.

14
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:31,743
I need the sympathy vote. Whoa.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,750
All right. So, my name is Rory Richardson.

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,710
I am joined by Vidhear from Delta Airlines

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,420
and Sam, who's a solution
architect focused on Kiro.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,790
And what we're gonna
do is we're gonna talk

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,220
a little bit about like,
the preface of the, where,

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,514
how we got here in the
evolution of agentic AI.

21
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:55,230
Then we're gonna talk about the importance

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,658
of spec-driven development
in relationship vibe coding.

23
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,070
We're gonna do a quick
introduction to Kiro,

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,814
and then we're gonna get some
real world tactical experience

25
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:08,220
by talking about how Delta Airlines

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,466
has been incorporating Kiro

27
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,320
into their software development lifecycle

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,210
and eventually their AI
development lifecycle.

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,663
And then lastly, we're
gonna wrap up with a demo.

30
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:26,034
The demo is coming in
pretty hot, as you know,

31
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,840
we've made a lot of announcements

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,820
yesterday morning in Garman's keynote.

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,950
Did y'all see Garman's keynote?

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,450
Raise your hand. Yeah.

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,955
Was it good? Yeah.

36
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:39,720
One of my favorite parts
is the autonomous agents

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,890
that we're introducing

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,473
because it greatly expands the context

39
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:48,473
and the ability of combining
multiple agents together

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,870
in order to do more
and more complex tests.

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,247
It's a very foundational concept

42
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,150
that I think is going to continue to grow

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,430
over the next six months, year.

44
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,050
I think more and more folks

45
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,850
are going to do more
and more complex things

46
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,390
with the agents themselves

47
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,330
and combining them for
the autonomous agents

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,296
to be able to orchestrate, monitor,

49
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,921
and even verify the work

50
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:15,033
of other agents to build them together.

51
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:19,500
So let's talk a little bit
about the agentic mindset,

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,913
because there are a few things
that we've learned like,

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,600
oh, probably the last
two years or 18 months,

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,376
when I would talk with a lot of customers,

55
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:32,880
usually they would come with an idea

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,650
or a business problem
that they wanted to solve.

57
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,569
But unfortunately a lot of
folks started with like really,

58
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,490
really hard problems and things
that were customer facing

59
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,870
and things that were about

60
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,580
the core competency of the business.

61
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,670
Like, great, we're gonna
get AI to do the very thing

62
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,443
that we sell to our customers.

63
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:55,260
Uh-huh. The problem is that's
taking on the most risk.

64
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,600
Right, and especially if
you haven't done one before,

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,628
why take on the most amount of risk?

66
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:02,460
Instead, the companies
that we've seen to be

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,460
the most agentic in nature
are starting with the muck.

68
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,560
I was talking to this business consultant

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,530
a year and a half ago from
Boston Consulting Group

70
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,960
and he said, "Rory,
generative AI is fabulous.

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,970
It can make music."

72
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,340
The problem is nobody wants it to.

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,320
What they want is for
it to go do the dishes

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,609
so that you can go off and make music.

75
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:28,882
So where we are seeing
the most exponential value

76
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:32,190
out of the application of generative AI

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,060
and agentic AI is removing toil and muck

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,120
to free humans up to be human.

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,180
Now, it means a lot of
developers are like, "Oh my god,

80
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,800
you know, AI's coming for my job."

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,390
How many thinks AI's coming for your job?

82
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,723
Raise your hands. Right, just you.

83
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:56,484
I don't, Gartner said it
best when they said that

84
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:01,260
AI is probably not coming
for your developers,

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,571
but a developer using AI is
probably coming for a developer

86
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,110
that is not using AI.

87
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,150
And I think that's kind of a true thing

88
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,200
because a lot of agents, I kind of view as

89
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,690
various ages of children, right?

90
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,077
You know, they have
really great ideas like,

91
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:17,910
"Oh, let me tell you, let me help you,

92
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,110
let me help you, let me help you."

93
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,210
And I was like, "No, I don't
trust you to touch the dishes.

94
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,560
You're too young."

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,450
So how we are dealing with the agents

96
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,190
depends on the level of sophistication

97
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,260
and how much we trust the information

98
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,830
that we're getting back from them

99
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,900
before we incorporate it
into what we're doing.

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,039
Because you're not gonna fire AI,

101
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,970
but I will fire a developer
if they, you know,

102
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,620
write bad code or malicious code

103
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,440
or introduce risk into the application.

104
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,730
Yeah, these are all things,

105
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,650
the humans are still responsible, y'all,

106
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,555
this is super important.

107
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:49,095
But can a developer be augmented?

108
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,730
I mean, think about all
the muck that you do

109
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,570
in your software development
lifecycle, right?

110
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,370
Who loves Jira?

111
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,083
Raise your hand. Yeah.

112
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,003
(Rory exhaling)

113
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,268
Jira something, (imitating buzzing)

114
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:10,710
but being able to search through
Jira, automate, you know,

115
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,260
Jira tickets and being able
to optimize that experiment

116
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,631
and will give everybody
else here a better day.

117
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:19,260
Because it's not, when
you're messing with Jira,

118
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,330
you're not creating that new application.

119
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,340
Because you know, when you
first started being a developer

120
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,670
you wanted to do, you wanted
to make cool stuff, right?

121
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,963
So everything that is not helping
you make cool stuff, muck.

122
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,810
So, quick history lesson,

123
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,636
I know you're all on this journey with us,

124
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:43,380
but we started off with plugins
into the existing IADEs,

125
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,540
vs code and you know,
JetBrains, intelligent.

126
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,130
And that seemed like a really great idea.

127
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,420
And then we got this idea like,

128
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,980
wouldn't it be cool if we made agents

129
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,544
that go off and do bespoke tasks

130
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:54,300
within the software development lifecycle,

131
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,240
like slash review or slash doc?

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,130
This was great, except we were
teaching a bunch of people

133
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,525
how to work with agents

134
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:03,693
and not teaching the agents
to work with the people.

135
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:07,260
How many of you have a smartphone,

136
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,290
like an iPhone or something?

137
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,419
Yeah, and do you remember
that you, you know,

138
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,399
were told specifically you
had to use that device,

139
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,370
how to optimize it, and then
you had to take a, you know,

140
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,623
an enablement session to fully use it.

141
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,290
Of course not.

142
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,000
It's just, you just get started

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,967
and you get to choose
whatever device that you want.

144
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,750
That's the developer experience, right?

145
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,330
So instead of teaching developers

146
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,030
or anyone how to interact the technology,

147
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,380
we should have the opposite approach.

148
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
And one of the ways we're able to do that

149
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,085
is to have an agentic AI
approach to software development.

150
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:44,790
So now, instead of having
just plugins into the IDE,

151
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,790
we've seen the rise of agentic
IDs and this was great.

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,040
I mean vibe coding school,
right? You just get started.

153
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,210
How many's had to debug

154
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,031
one of your colleague's
vibe coding projects?

155
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:59,095
Yeah, super fun, right?

156
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:00,660
(Rory laughing)

157
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,293
But it's also kind of an anti-pattern.

158
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:05,386
I mean, first of all, the democratization

159
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:07,903
of people being able to create something

160
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:10,410
just through natural language is,

161
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,780
it was the dream of low-code, no-code.

162
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,830
It's always been the dream.

163
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,720
Like, how do I, can I just prototype this?

164
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,798
How do I just get started? It was great.

165
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,790
But then how do to work
with other developers

166
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,290
to do more and more complex things?

167
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,100
And that's combining
spec-driven development

168
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,270
with vibe coding to accelerate.

169
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,897
How are you getting something, you know,

170
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:34,893
from prototype into production?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,144
The other change that we've seen this year

172
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:41,940
is the rise of protocols for
agent to agent communication.

173
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,842
How many of you people are
using MCP servers? Right?

174
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,210
Wasn't that way last year.

175
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,792
I mean, this is a radical change

176
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,684
in how we're thinking
about the very architecture

177
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:55,470
of agents themselves.

178
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,770
So, earlier this year I was like, well,

179
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,210
what is the definition of an agent?

180
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,157
Because if you look on the
internet, no one could agree.

181
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,100
Like you get, you know,
three people together,

182
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,049
they would have all different definitions

183
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,190
of what an agent was.

184
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,450
So we're gonna go with my definition

185
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,100
because I'm the one with the mic.

186
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:13,830
I started out with, well,

187
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,320
it has to be able to form
tasks asynchronously.

188
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,660
It has to go off and come back.

189
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,447
It has to have some degree of autonomy.

190
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,800
It has to have agency.

191
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
And I mean that in a very pride
and prejudice sense, right?

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,193
It has to be able to make
some decisions on its own.

193
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,303
But this last idea, this last idea

194
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,530
of adding the word atomic is fairly new

195
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,660
and the most controversial.

196
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,860
And yeah, they all start
with a, I did that.

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,876
Atomic is meaning that you're able

198
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,740
to make more bespoke agents

199
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,410
and then combine these
bespoke smaller agents

200
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,560
in different ways to do more
and more complex things.

201
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,225
So instead of using a
really, really large model

202
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,651
that has been trained on a
really, really large data set,

203
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:02,910
what if you could do something
that was more bespoke?

204
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,280
So instead of being good at everything,

205
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,891
what if you could be
great at a few things?

206
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,464
The idea of making atomic agents

207
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:13,866
kind of brings me back
to my microservices days.

208
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:17,283
And the idea that you can
combine microservices together

209
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:19,710
to do more and more complex applications

210
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,239
and also reuse those agents.

211
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:25,529
This was sort of the
foundational concept behind

212
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,691
what we're trying to do
with autonomous agents.

213
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:32,880
Being able to use the
right agent for the job,

214
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,900
but not necessarily having to
teach you which agent that is

215
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,310
and when to call it.

216
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,680
These autonomous agents have the ability

217
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,470
to help make those decisions for you.

218
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,390
Now, this kind of feel,
I love a lot of sci-fi.

219
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,005
I'm a huge sci-fi fan,
and it feels almost like

220
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,630
what we really want is Jarvis, right?

221
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,112
Now don't go full ultron, right?

222
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:58,959
But in "Ironman" one,

223
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,170
Jarvis was a natural language interface

224
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,227
for IoT devices in Tony's house.

225
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:06,180
By the time you get to "Ironman" three,

226
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,500
Tony is able to go to the holodeck

227
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,949
and go directly into the most humanistic

228
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,027
areas of innovation.

229
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:13,838
He's able to just start

230
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:18,180
to vibe code the next Ironman suit.

231
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,520
And then when he's done, he's
able to look over at Jarvis

232
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,680
and said, "All right, now go
off and build the Iron Legion."

233
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,092
Because Jarvis is handling all
the supply chain management

234
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,893
of all of the resources in the house,

235
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,923
managing all the design specs,

236
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:35,693
managing search within the
libraries of Tony's work.

237
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,223
I mean, can you imagine what the world

238
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:40,237
is going to be like when
your kids have access

239
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:43,025
to that level of assistance

240
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:46,200
for anything that they want to make?

241
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,813
That's the world that we're living in.

242
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,010
I mean, I have a 15-year-old

243
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,120
and I've been trying to teach this kid

244
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,952
to code since he was four.

245
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,720
I can't get those 10 years back

246
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,846
because what is the role of Python

247
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:59,130
by the time that kid hits the job market?

248
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,660
I mean the syntax is
kind of taken care of.

249
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,980
I'm not saying computer science is dead

250
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,450
by any stretch of the imagination,

251
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,340
but the world has dramatically changed

252
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,530
for how our children
are going to interface

253
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,060
with solutions and innovation.

254
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,220
And it's not about agents per se,

255
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,960
it's about how fast and
how hard can they dream

256
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,412
because they're gonna be able to create it

257
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,523
with the assistance of these tools.

258
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:29,910
So we created an agentic IDE like hero

259
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,789
that married the idea of vibe coding

260
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:35,975
with traditional spec-driven development.

261
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,408
This also changed a lot of the roles

262
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:41,220
within our two pizza teams at AWS,

263
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,960
it's been highly disruptive

264
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,220
because now we move much
faster when we embed our PMs

265
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,110
into those teams because we're able

266
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,583
to iterate on the specs much, much faster.

267
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,970
So, engineering reaches a problem.

268
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,130
They were like, "Hey,
this isn't gonna work."

269
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,500
PM takes it and goes, "Yep,
let's rewrite, you know,

270
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,670
the direction of what we're going."

271
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,410
And that entire process is, hey,

272
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,560
it takes a matter of hours and not weeks.

273
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,113
This level of speed has
created other problems

274
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:12,163
because the number of code
commits that we're able to do,

275
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,866
test wasn't ready for it.

276
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,330
QA, wasn't ready for it.

277
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,220
There's downstream impacts to the speed

278
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,203
that we're able to get things done now.

279
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,616
So having an AI IDE
has greatly accelerated

280
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:29,248
well, everything that we touch at AWS

281
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,641
because, and at Amazon.

282
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:35,340
You can view Amazon as like
our first best worst customer,

283
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,086
'cause they know where we sit

284
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,029
and they come and they
give us direct feedback

285
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,957
and we have to compete for
their developer time as well

286
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:44,730
in order to figure out like,

287
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,700
what is the tools that we
should be creating internally.

288
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,344
And so, that's our own internal test bed

289
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,920
in order to refine like,
some of our thinking

290
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,633
and what we decided to build.

291
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,990
Also, we found tremendous uptick

292
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,151
of the command line interface.

293
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,030
The command line interface,

294
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,150
we found a lot of people were using it

295
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,478
or weren't necessarily having an IDE

296
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:15,011
already installed on their computer.

297
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,670
That means this is a
different type of user

298
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,350
that is using the command line interface

299
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,940
to do different tasks,

300
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,238
but also these tasks are associated with

301
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,254
the software development lifecycle.

302
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:28,110
So we incorporated the
command line interface

303
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,100
also into Kiro.

304
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,403
And so now Kiro is also
available in the terminal.

305
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:40,255
This evolution of agentic AI

306
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:45,255
has changed everything
about what we're doing,

307
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:49,409
and it continues to accelerate

308
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:53,040
exactly how we're creating software,

309
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,697
not only from just a traditional
application development,

310
00:13:56,697 --> 00:14:00,241
but also how we're creating
the agents themselves.

311
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,580
Now, I got my roots in microservices

312
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,493
and breaking up monolithic
architectures into microservices.

313
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,280
I've been talking with customers lately

314
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,113
that aren't doing that anymore,
because that's so 2022.

315
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,730
Now they're thinking
about breaking up monolith

316
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,015
into true agentic architecture
and bypassing that step.

317
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:22,590
So the foundation of these
applications are agentic.

318
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,320
And so the process of creating agents

319
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,080
has fundamentally changed and accelerated.

320
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,580
You'll hear a lot about the tools

321
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,370
that we are developing to enable that,

322
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,070
whether it's a framework like Strands SDK

323
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,590
or an agentic platform like Agent Core

324
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,750
that gives you the building blocks for,

325
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,471
you know, runtime and memory,

326
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:46,471
but also choosing the right
inference for your job.

327
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:50,645
But the thing that I think is
the most interesting is data.

328
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:53,535
Because now if you're
able to create an agent

329
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:58,410
that is directly
responsible for your data,

330
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,030
the responses that you're going to get

331
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,460
are more bespoke to your environment.

332
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,687
So the ability to create these agents

333
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,685
in combination with the full tool chain,

334
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:10,436
well, I'm really excited
to see what's next

335
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,994
and what people are going to create.

336
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:15,150
I've been working really
closely with Delta

337
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,801
because Delta has a mindset

338
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,603
that is agentic architecture in nature.

339
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,363
When they started sharing

340
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:25,050
some of their architecture diagrams,

341
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,928
I was super impressed with
how they were thinking about

342
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,913
those autonomous agents
and what do you call 'em?

343
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,807
Nano agents or sub-agents?

344
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,553
- Sub-agents.
- Sub-agents.

345
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,200
And that made me feel really old

346
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,060
because in my architecture diagram

347
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,290
there was a load balancer,

348
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,640
there was EC2 and theirs is different.

349
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,698
So they're trying to push the
envelope of what's possible

350
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,462
in the safest possible way

351
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:57,210
that scales within an
enterprise organization.

352
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,000
So with that, I'd like to invite Vidhear

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,530
to talk about their experience

354
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,553
and how they've applied it
directly to Delta Airlines.

355
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:07,139
Come on up. You are not gonna catch me.

356
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,891
I swear, we're not gonna
trust fall. I'm gonna be fine.

357
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,849
- I'm gonna be (indistinct).

358
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:12,327
- I'm gonna live up to my word.

359
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm here to catch you.

360
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
- No, it's gonna be fine.

361
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,143
No, no.
- Okay.

362
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,670
(Vidhear laughs)

363
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,670
Before I begin, how many of you
flew on Delta to reach here,

364
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,506
this amazing conference?

365
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:32,613
That's good. Thank you for
your business, genuinely.

366
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:38,451
And for those who use the
free wifi in our flights

367
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,733
to finish the last minute work

368
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,743
or prepare flights like
me, you are welcome.

369
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,140
Delta is the first airline in the US

370
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,413
that introduced free
wifi across our flights.

371
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:57,750
We are the pioneers of
innovation and technology

372
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,190
in entire airline industry.

373
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,963
Hundred years of legacy and
history that we created.

374
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,490
Now, decisions like this are
made behind a philosophy that,

375
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,900
which I would like to share with you all,

376
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,900
is we'd like to create
experience for our customers,

377
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,999
the best experience
possible for our customers,

378
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:25,999
and make it as the new standard
and execute it every day.

379
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,480
And that is the philosophy
that we follow in every domain

380
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,350
and every group in Delta,
even in developer experience,

381
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,760
which we lead and serve
for our Delta developers,

382
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,260
we follow the same philosophy.

383
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,210
We would like to provide the best tools

384
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,160
and technology for our developers

385
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,990
so that we can reduce their friction

386
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,453
and improve their innovation every day.

387
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,030
Rory shared great vision
on the agentic roadmap

388
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,340
that AWS is getting into,

389
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,330
and it aligns very much with our vision

390
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,580
and the roadmap that we
are planning as well.

391
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,980
How many of you had seen slides like this

392
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,850
and started preparing mental mapping of

393
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,770
how to adjust my roadmap?

394
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,860
Which things I need to
prioritize and deprioritize?

395
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,870
I'll raise my both hands

396
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,000
because every tech
conference that I visited,

397
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,720
every exec we reached out to,
whenever they share something,

398
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,510
immediately we started
mapping how to adjust,

399
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,223
which changes we need to make.

400
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,830
But here is what we learned that

401
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:38,340
we can achieve this autonomy

402
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,406
agentic architecture by building on trust,

403
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:45,213
the trust from our developer community.

404
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,830
With the rollout of Q Developer
on the left hand side,

405
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,480
the coding assistance,

406
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,390
Q Developer is fully
adopted in entire Delta.

407
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,087
Almost every developer uses Q Developer

408
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,250
and they are giving great feedback.

409
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,440
It laid that foundation.

410
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,198
In the middle, what we have
Kiro, IDE, the agentic IDE,

411
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:10,020
which we are scaling now
across the Delta enterprise,

412
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,000
and we are marching towards
the autonomous agentic systems,

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,410
which are going to be integrated

414
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,093
into our developer workflows.

415
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,710
And with the help of Q Developers so far,

416
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,140
what we gained was we were able to capture

417
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,870
the major wins that Q Developer provided

418
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,880
and also helped us to understand,

419
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,650
what are the areas of improvement?

420
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,306
What are the automations that we can build

421
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,923
for our developers?

422
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,430
So, to increase this adoption

423
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,950
and get to the stage that we want,

424
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,781
we created a model, right?

425
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:49,827
One thing that we didn't try was,

426
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:51,660
we didn't try to convince

427
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,090
all of our thousands of
developers in one session,

428
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,702
not at the goal, right?

429
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:57,780
It is not possible.

430
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,890
At the same time, we are not staffed up

431
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,050
to reach out and talk to
each and every developer.

432
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,792
So what we did was, with the
support of our leadership,

433
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,350
we reached out to all
of our domain leaders

434
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,640
and asked them, nominate
some of the champions

435
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,531
who are technically and
technologically very sound

436
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,610
and very trustworthy

437
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,320
and they can influence
the developer community

438
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:26,970
without any title and authority, right?

439
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,816
With the trust.

440
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,220
So with the help of these dev champions,

441
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,940
we are able to scale this model.

442
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,960
We went domain by domain,
we trained each domain

443
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,251
and also we build the trainer model.

444
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:46,203
Because these days
everyone knows AI, right?

445
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,020
When Rory was sharing that

446
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,880
the technology is always like technology,

447
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,900
how it's gonna help for
our children in future,

448
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,817
that immediately reminded me

449
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:59,970
a personal experience at my home as well.

450
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,180
Few weeks back I was, I
have a 7-year-old daughter.

451
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,820
So I asked her just casually,

452
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,430
two simple math problems, multiplication.

453
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:13,430
I gave her try these out. So
she took, "Okay, I'll try."

454
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,233
Five minutes back, she came back

455
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,627
and asked, "Can I use chat GPT?"

456
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,364
I'm not making this up.
It's really happened.

457
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,170
I was really shocked.

458
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,320
I was like, "I'm really surprised.

459
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,840
Where did you heard about Chat GPT?"

460
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,910
I was expecting maybe you're gonna ask me

461
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,058
can I use calculator to do this?

462
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:37,977
And she was like, "What is a calculator?"

463
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,260
See, the AI advancements
are happening very fast

464
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,040
that everyone knows how to
use AI, how to adopt them.

465
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,218
But the most important
thing is inputs to this AI,

466
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:54,480
the inference that we are
gonna provide to this AI.

467
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,570
Because everyone knows, like I said,

468
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,543
everything, AI is an amplifier.

469
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:05,543
So the more structured prompts,
the more context we provide,

470
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,010
the more guardrails we introduce,

471
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,840
we are gonna get the best output

472
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,290
that everyone is looking for.

473
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,239
At the same time, if we have chaos,

474
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:17,460
it's gonna amplify that chaos.

475
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,170
So that's why we focus a lot
on setting those inputs right.

476
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,133
Getting our community ready so
that we can scale this model.

477
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:32,790
Now these dev champions, this
is not their primary job.

478
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,560
They have their their day jobs.

479
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,260
They need to work in their
sprints and scrum models.

480
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,050
So when we reached out
and formed this community,

481
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,320
we clearly said we wanted to
clearly set the expectations

482
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,970
because we want to approach
this outcome based, right?

483
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,810
So we clearly said that this
is what we expect from you.

484
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,605
We want you to participate
in the initial session

485
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,770
so that you can know, learn how to train,

486
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,080
how to train your teams.

487
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,080
We need you to participate
in our office hours

488
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
so that you can help others

489
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,890
and also listen to their questions.

490
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,200
And we need you to
contribute your prompts,

491
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,050
any prompts that you
worked and we need you

492
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,230
to bring along your entire
team, not just developers,

493
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,493
your product owners, scrum
masters, how to use Q Developer.

494
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:24,840
They helped us to reach
almost every developer

495
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,233
in entire Delta IT, which is the best part

496
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:32,370
that any email campaign or
marketing campaign could do

497
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,670
because nobody reads emails.

498
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,110
That's the fact, right?

499
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,555
So using the dev champions, we were able

500
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:44,250
to establish that community
and able to scale this model

501
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,713
and increase the Q Developer adoption.

502
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,480
But we started seeing that
developers are writing code.

503
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
We started seeing that more,

504
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,349
we're writing more code much faster,

505
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:02,250
but still we're not
able to see the result.

506
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,210
What is the end result?

507
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,130
What is the outcome that is aligning

508
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,890
with our business expectations?

509
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,510
So this is the pivotal moment,

510
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,520
which is the very important part.

511
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,073
The feedback that we got
from our developers is,

512
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,684
it is very important to understand

513
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:22,199
that moving from help
me write this function,

514
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,557
to help me build this feature.

515
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:29,259
We need AI that understands
the business context,

516
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,428
our governance, our compliance
rules, our integrations.

517
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,631
It needs to understand all of those.

518
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,342
Then only we can get to the stage of

519
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,823
delivering the feature level output.

520
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,513
That is when Kiro entered into our story.

521
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,895
So we partnered with our AWS team

522
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:53,070
and we are one of the
early pilot users of Kiro.

523
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,810
We introduced it to our, again,
our same champions community

524
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,144
and also some power users of Q Developer.

525
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:03,990
And we asked them, go ahead and use Kiro

526
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,180
and start giving us your feedback.

527
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,340
Because we already built
their trust, right?

528
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,092
When we rolled out the Q Developer,

529
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,720
we started to gain their trust

530
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,660
and they started giving
us responding feedback

531
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,520
in the form of feedback.

532
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,108
Four main themes that
evolved from their feedback.

533
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:27,108
They clearly said that using
Kiro versus any other tool,

534
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,430
we are able to see that it can understand

535
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,841
our complex code base, our business rules,

536
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,305
our existing logic and extract it

537
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:38,739
and build the context
that it is expecting.

538
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,420
At the same time, they clearly
said that it was able to

539
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,476
break down the given requirement

540
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:48,483
to easily implement a
design and executable task.

541
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,880
And most important thing,
we started seeing that Kiro,

542
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,713
with the help of Kiro,

543
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:58,143
we are able to build
production ready code.

544
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,292
I want to underline that,
production ready code.

545
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,442
No two enterprises will have
the same set of governance

546
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:09,090
and compliance rules to
build their products.

547
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,940
So it is very important
a tool to understand,

548
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,810
establish the context and
adjust and deliver the code

549
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,280
that is production ready

550
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,430
and ready to deploy into
the higher environments,

551
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,503
which we are able to see using Kiro.

552
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,370
We also heard feedback from our architects

553
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,691
and some of the developers
that they were able to use Kiro

554
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:34,500
to be a critic in their
architecture decisions.

555
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,690
They use, some of them
use that as a soundboard

556
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,900
to validate that is my
design and approach,

557
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,810
is it correct or not?

558
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,691
That is the most exciting part.

559
00:26:44,691 --> 00:26:47,659
So we started seeing that Kiro becoming

560
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:52,650
one of the team member who
has this beautiful memory

561
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,720
of memorizing the thousand lines of code,

562
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,795
establishing the context,

563
00:26:57,795 --> 00:27:01,530
at the same time, giving
you advices and suggestions,

564
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,300
which direction you need to go

565
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,277
for your next product
and next implementation.

566
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:09,420
That is the most exciting
part we started seeing

567
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,943
and we started realizing
with the help of Kiro.

568
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:18,794
And the spec-driven
development is the most unique

569
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:22,533
and innovative feature that
we came across in Kiro.

570
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,480
Simple. It's not that complex.

571
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,260
Three simple step, step
one, lock your requirements,

572
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,301
to give you a detailed requirements.

573
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:37,140
Step two, Kiro automatically
breaks down your requirements

574
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,393
and start building the
design, generating the design.

575
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:44,250
And step three, it will
also give you the tasks,

576
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,710
giving power to the developers.

577
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,260
That is the most important
part, human in the loop.

578
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,078
Ultimately, developers has the power,

579
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,350
whether they accept the design

580
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,240
or they're gonna execute those tasks

581
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,029
or they're gonna give refine
or alter any direction

582
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,554
that Kiro needs to implement those.

583
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:06,270
So we started seeing that
level of flexibility,

584
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,330
at the same time, context awareness.

585
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,330
And the most important
part, the backlog grooming.

586
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,250
How many of you familiar with
this? I see a lot of nods.

587
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,650
Everyone, right? Backlog, grooming.

588
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,630
Several hours of backlog grooming,

589
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,173
lot of debates about story points,

590
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:30,365
definition of done, acceptance criteria

591
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:32,820
and lot of feelings get hurt.

592
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,560
And so much, so much drama, right?

593
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,740
So what we started to, this is the thing

594
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,260
that we'd never expected
when we introduced Kiro

595
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,857
to our pilot users.

596
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:48,840
They start, they transformed
this backlog grooming days

597
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,050
into Kiro spec design days.

598
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,120
Kiro spec design sessions.

599
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,940
So they used that time to
refine the requirements.

600
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,090
They started with Kiro
instead of backlog grooming,

601
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,430
they started with Kiro
with their requirements

602
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,280
and gave Kiro the prompt in a way

603
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,260
that this is the format we create

604
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,270
our features and use the stories.

605
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,700
And this is the, this is our model

606
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,370
we would like you to create accordingly.

607
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,650
They started seeing those results.

608
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:21,083
And those sessions, because
Kiro can remember the context

609
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:25,609
and it can automatically
adjust based on your code base.

610
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:30,300
The amount of time even
to do the spec refinement

611
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,100
is also getting shorter and shorter.

612
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,852
And surprisingly no one
complained that petition

613
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:40,383
to bring back those
backlog rooming session.

614
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,573
We'll take that win.

615
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,540
So, with the pilot, right,

616
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,490
I'm not talking about scaling the Kiro,

617
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,360
we didn't scale the Kiro.

618
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,610
We're getting ready to scale the Kiro.

619
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,821
With just the pilot users, right,

620
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:59,730
we're able to deliver the first ever

621
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,100
most intelligent developer portal,

622
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,185
end-to-end production ready

623
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:07,833
meeting all of our compliance
and governance rules.

624
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:13,327
So, I'm sure many of you are familiar

625
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:17,970
whenever there is a business
group with the product owners

626
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,923
and there is a technology counterparts,

627
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,920
how much our handoff happens,

628
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,836
how many our meetings we go through,

629
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,670
our business product owners,

630
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,816
they'll create the
mockups, the requirements,

631
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,640
Word document, detailed Word documents,

632
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,920
and God help us some Excel sheets

633
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,503
with all of the requirements, right?

634
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,401
But still, even after all
of this back and forth,

635
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:43,149
there will be some gaps still

636
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:46,833
whenever the end result on
the end product is delivered.

637
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:52,050
So, what we wanted to try out was recently

638
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,050
we trained our business
product owners how to use Kiro.

639
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,596
These are the people who never coded

640
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:03,780
a single line in their life.

641
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,570
All they did was Word documents, mockups.

642
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,493
So we trained them how to use Kiro.

643
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,470
The end result, they were able to provide

644
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,470
or generate working prototypes,
aligning with the roadmap,

645
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,370
aligning with the new
feature that they wanted.

646
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,950
And they were able to easily
hand off that working prototype

647
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,374
with their technology
counterparts who are easily in,

648
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:34,803
ours actually integrate with
their working application.

649
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,700
Again, I'm not making this up.

650
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,794
These business product owners said that

651
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:46,794
the prototype or the design
usually takes us a quarter,

652
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,180
one increment to get that,

653
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,670
and we are able to complete it

654
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,193
in a matter of days and weeks.

655
00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:00,451
It's not only about
the time we are saving,

656
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:05,451
it is also about fixing those gaps, right?

657
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,892
We started to see that the gap
between the technology team

658
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:12,180
and the business product
teams getting disappeared

659
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,670
because now everyone started to see

660
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,040
and talk everything in the same language.

661
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,328
No more assumptions, no more imaginations.

662
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:23,340
Product owners are able to
give the working prototypes

663
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,480
and technology counterparts

664
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,820
are able to immediately visualize

665
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,463
and integrate the actual application.

666
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,030
And like I said, production ready code

667
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,673
is getting delivered every, every time.

668
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,440
And I share with you what we delivered.

669
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,450
At the same time, I
would also like to share

670
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,690
what our developers were saying, right?

671
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,880
Highlighting here three quotes

672
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,270
from the feedback that we
got from our pilot users.

673
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,110
One of the engineering
leader, right, who said that

674
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,220
I forgot my coding practice several years,

675
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,230
but I gave it a try using Kiro.

676
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,761
He said that now I can give tasks to Kiro

677
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,740
and I can go back to my meetings.

678
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,573
In the background,

679
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:11,430
Kiro is able to continue
to executing those tasks.

680
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,710
And once I'm done with the
meetings and I'm coming back

681
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,773
and refining and reviewing
the code that it generated.

682
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,433
And one of the developers, she said that

683
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,590
spec-driven development stopped me

684
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,423
going circles with vibe coding.

685
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,594
Anyone heard about vibe coding?

686
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:28,783
Anyone? No.

687
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:29,940
(Vidhear laughs)

688
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,240
So it is the, I think it's
the official word of the year

689
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,390
for 2025, vibe coding, isn't it?

690
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,640
Lot of prompting, iteration,

691
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,238
prompting, screaming, lot of tears.

692
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,600
We think that there is
a progress being made,

693
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,260
but our committee history will
tell the actual story, right?

694
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,260
So, using Kiro with the
spec-driven development,

695
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:59,392
what she shared was, it is
remembering the context.

696
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,646
It is giving me the destination,

697
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:07,585
at the same time the path
to get to that destination,

698
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:12,585
it is not building code out of vacuum.

699
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,370
The code is getting generated
based on the context.

700
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,110
And one of the senior developers said that

701
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,898
breaking down technical
design into stories

702
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:24,993
with full repo context.

703
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,570
This is very important, right?

704
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,313
Because there's a lot of,

705
00:34:29,313 --> 00:34:33,000
there will be a lot of freedom
in greenfield development.

706
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,700
If you're starting from
scratch, sky is the limit.

707
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,980
Blue skies, we can make
a lot of assumptions,

708
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,500
a lot of imaginations,
prototyping, all of that.

709
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,330
But if we are implementing

710
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,370
or doing a Brownfield application,

711
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,190
if you have a code that is
written several years back

712
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,238
and it's the most important application,

713
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:53,640
it's very challenging to plan any changes.

714
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,060
But with the help of Kiro,
they're able to create the work

715
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,241
that needs to be done aligning
with the context of the code.

716
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:03,820
And 94% of the pilot participants reported

717
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,413
four and greater than four
out of five the feedback.

718
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:14,387
IDEs are like rifles to the
Marines, to the developers.

719
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,070
There's so much attached.

720
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,728
It is not a simple task asking developers

721
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:22,350
to try out this new IDE,

722
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,320
but yet all of our
pilot participants were,

723
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,180
because of the trust we built,

724
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,760
they were very open and
flexible and used this

725
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,223
and started giving this great feedback.

726
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,230
And I also shared that Q
Developer the success, right,

727
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,133
that we achieved.

728
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,080
And this is what the trust looks like.

729
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,140
So we launched Q Developer end of March

730
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,300
and the first week of April

731
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,300
and in six months we're able
to achieve 1,948% growth.

732
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,493
That's not a typo,
that's a real percentage.

733
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,323
And I really wish my stock portfolio

734
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:07,623
gave me this kind of
returns in six months.

735
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,680
Because of the trust that we built

736
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,500
the developers are embracing

737
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,240
any technology that we are building.

738
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,590
And the Q Developer laid that foundations

739
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,290
on those foundations who are getting ready

740
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,143
to scale Kiro across the enterprise.

741
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,700
Of course you need to measure
any of your, any rollout,

742
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,760
any technology enhancements
that you're doing.

743
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
Always metrics are very important.

744
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,193
So we created our own dashboard
which helped us to measure

745
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:44,700
what is the user adoption is looking like,

746
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,740
what is the engagement is looking like.

747
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,172
At the same time, what is
the Q Developer impact?

748
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:52,380
Which is clearly showed
us that we are able

749
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,653
to produce more code in
the less amount of time.

750
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,460
And again, like I said, the developers,

751
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,450
what they're saying was
primarily it's coming down to,

752
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,290
they're seeing a fundamental
shift in our ways of working.

753
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,630
They're no longer bogged down

754
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,490
or tied to the implementation details

755
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,253
because they were able to give
those implementation details

756
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,020
to Kiro and let it work.

757
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,000
And they are primarily focusing

758
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,063
and a lot of focus on
architecture and design thinking.

759
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:24,280
And also they're focusing now

760
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,800
to get rid of technical debt, right?

761
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,560
Everyone's favorite word, isn't that?

762
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,840
So they're taking advantage of Kiro

763
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,760
and getting rid of technical debt.

764
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,335
And a lot of use cases we implemented

765
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:42,363
within this short span
using pilot, pilot group.

766
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:50,339
So, the takeaway that I would
like to share with you all is

767
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,280
from this pilot experience

768
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,830
and from the adoption of Q Developer

769
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,052
with this agentic AI
tools, developer tools,

770
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:02,643
we are able to say yes more, now.

771
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:06,090
I know many of people, leaders here,

772
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,390
you might have read the book,
saying no is very important,

773
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,107
but no, these agentic tools
are helping us to say yes more.

774
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:17,610
Years worth of backlog, which
got competed and deprioritized

775
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,080
because of competing priorities.

776
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,070
Now we are able to say yes and
start solving those problems.

777
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,510
We are able to bridge the gap

778
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,190
between our business counterparts

779
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,870
and technology counterparts.

780
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,260
And everyone is trying to,
now is able to see the same,

781
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,143
speak the same language,
and see the same outcome.

782
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:38,490
Now the deliverables are no longer

783
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,623
tied to the size of the team.

784
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,520
They're no longer proportionate.

785
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,240
Smaller teams are starting to
deliver the biggest outcome

786
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,270
with the leveraging tools like Kiro.

787
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,130
And what's next for Delta?

788
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,480
Like I said, we are ready,

789
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,337
we are getting ready to scale
Kiro across our enterprise

790
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:00,060
and a lot of exciting announcements,

791
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,822
Kiro agents that were announced,

792
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:04,917
and we're going to integrate
all of the Kiro agents

793
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,773
into our developer
workflows and life cycle.

794
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,930
See, in all of this,
with all this journey,

795
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,520
one thing that our
personal observation is,

796
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,462
the companies in near
future, like a decade or so,

797
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:25,201
they're gonna win, not just with AI tools,

798
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:30,201
but when these AI tools are
people are woven together

799
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,810
starting from the build design deployment

800
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,460
from product owners all the
way to production, right?

801
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,990
We need to focus on introducing AI

802
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,810
across the product development life cycle,

803
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:49,050
which we also call as PDLC.

804
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,363
Because we are Delta,
we allow our acronyms.

805
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,880
So, introducing AI tools and automation

806
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
across entire product
development lifecycle

807
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,450
is very important.

808
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,520
Q Developer laid that foundation

809
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,360
and helped to build the trust
among our developer community.

810
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,090
Now we are taking the advantage

811
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,093
and rolling out Kiro for our future.

812
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,380
Now I'm gonna ask Sam to
come up and show some magic

813
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,680
how the Kiro is going
to look like in the IDE.

814
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,680
- Thanks Vidhear. It
was really good to hear.

815
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,486
- [Rory] You're supposed
to clap, his boss is here.

816
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:25,804
(all laughing)

817
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:28,804
(audience applauds)

818
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,440
- Nice to hear a practical
experience with the tool here.

819
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,300
So I'm Sam, I'm gonna show
you a quick tour of Kiro here

820
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,070
with a demo that I put together as a video

821
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,213
because there's a lot to show

822
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:46,560
and it will go pretty quick here.

823
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,285
And so, there'll be some
time lapse that I'll include.

824
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:53,641
So Kiro is a full featured IDE.

825
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,230
So you'll see a lot of the stuff

826
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,480
that you're kind of used
to seeing in your IDE,

827
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,740
but it's purpose built
for AI agent development.

828
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,906
And as you open it up, you'll see the

829
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:08,906
spec versus vibe kind of options
here, which is kind of new.

830
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,320
And I'll talk a little bit more about

831
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,313
the spec version of this or features.

832
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:17,370
But we have some tools included in here

833
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,900
to help you manage your context,

834
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,971
like being able to load files if you want,

835
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:25,353
grabbing output from your
terminal as you're debugging,

836
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:29,130
pointing to particular
URLs if you need that.

837
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,675
You can even include images

838
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:36,180
so that if you have UI
designs or sequence diagrams

839
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,070
or something like that
you want to include,

840
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,481
you can add those.

841
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:44,010
And you can select the different
agents models you want,

842
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,234
including the latest,
like the Sonic four, five,

843
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:53,234
we have Opus and there's
this option for auto mode.

844
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:58,470
The auto mode will let
Kiro automatically pick

845
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,247
which model it's gonna
use, optimal for that.

846
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,210
And it allows you to save a little bit

847
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,280
on the credits as you're
doing it that way.

848
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,900
So it'll pick maybe a model

849
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,370
that might be a little bit cheaper to use

850
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,460
for the particular use
case that it's going after.

851
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,380
On this panel on the left over here

852
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,740
you'll see all the Kiro tools
and these are the things

853
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,860
that are gonna really help
you with your project,

854
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,837
manage the AI agents.

855
00:42:21,837 --> 00:42:25,290
Particularly, we'll start with this,

856
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,850
the steering files component here.

857
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,300
So steering files are a way to give rules

858
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,250
and guidance to the AI.

859
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,100
You can have prompts that
you share amongst your teams

860
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,680
that you might put in there,

861
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,349
coding standards, those kinds of things.

862
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,239
And it'll give Kiro a map
of your code base as well.

863
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,050
So you can click this button here

864
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:50,400
and Kiro will just automatically
examine your project

865
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,740
if you have a project
that you've already built

866
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,230
and kind of creates these three like,

867
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,750
foundational steering files for it.

868
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,150
One that's just a product file

869
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,757
that describes what the
product is supposed to do,

870
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:04,377
the features and functions.

871
00:43:04,377 --> 00:43:08,730
It'll create a tech file
that outlines what all

872
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:13,455
the tech stack that you're
using and a structure file.

873
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:16,890
So the structure gives it kind
of a map of where files are,

874
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,603
what kind of data you have,

875
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:22,230
anything that the agent might need to know

876
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,220
so it doesn't have to load

877
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,780
the whole entire code base all the time,

878
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,863
it'll use this to navigate
through your environment.

879
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,780
It also has this feature

880
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,390
with a file match pattern
that you can give it.

881
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,024
So this particular
steering file I have here

882
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:37,763
is for my UX guidelines

883
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:40,020
and I'm telling it to only load this

884
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,174
when it's working on HTML or CSS files.

885
00:43:42,174 --> 00:43:45,605
And that way this doesn't get
into my context all the time

886
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:50,043
because too much context can
confuse the AI agent here.

887
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,580
These are just MD files,

888
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,830
so you can source them with your project,

889
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,480
you can share them.

890
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,617
Of course with Kiro we can manage MCP,

891
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:08,670
but if you go to kiro.dev

892
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,880
you'll find that we
have a directory of MCPs

893
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,820
that we recommend that are
easy to just with a click

894
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,824
you get them added to your project.

895
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:20,241
And we'll take that a step
further with something that

896
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,960
I think today is probably the first

897
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,650
that we've ever really talked
about this yet is powers.

898
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,042
So Kiro Powers is a little bit,

899
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:31,707
they're like MCP on steroids if you will.

900
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:34,050
You get a little bit more than just an MCP

901
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,240
when you're trying to,
like you have an MCP file,

902
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,530
you have several of them,

903
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,700
you're not sure when you need them,

904
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,440
when you don't need them.

905
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,720
You'll maybe want to augment that

906
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,180
with some rules and steering files.

907
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,100
But with Powers it combines
those all into basically one.

908
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,260
So you'll get, and we have some

909
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,026
recommended ones here as well,
but you can create your own,

910
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,350
you'll see a bigger list in
the actual released version

911
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,940
that will come out.

912
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,910
I think it actually was
available this morning.

913
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,070
But for this particular project,

914
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,190
I'm gonna build something that
I'm gonna use Strands for.

915
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,217
So I can just go to the directory,

916
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:14,676
include the Strands Power,
and now I've enabled Kiro

917
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:16,642
with the information it needs

918
00:45:16,642 --> 00:45:20,917
in order to help me build
this Strands driven power.

919
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,980
So I'm gonna build a project
here, I'm gonna show you,

920
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,178
this is Kiros on, this
is my fake retail site

921
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:30,880
that I built for my demo

922
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,740
and I want to add a customer
support agent to this

923
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:40,944
using Bedrock and Strands.

924
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:45,420
So, I'll just jump into Kiro
here, I'll give it a prompt.

925
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,670
In the past I might have
to be very, very careful

926
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,910
about the prompt that
I'm giving my AI agent,

927
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,620
but here I'm gonna do fairly simple

928
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,020
because I'll get a chance to refine this

929
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,313
and work through this.

930
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:04,947
And I wish my play dude
would disappear, but okay.

931
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:10,974
So Kiro will go off, examine this prompt

932
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:15,974
and create a requirements document for me.

933
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,030
This is an MD file. I'll be
able to share this with my team.

934
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,570
So a chance to review
this with stakeholders,

935
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,564
go back and forth a little bit

936
00:46:25,564 --> 00:46:28,714
and iterate on the requirements for this.

937
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:32,040
And then if I need to
make some updates to it,

938
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,183
I can do that.

939
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,993
And so, I'm reviewing these requirements

940
00:46:36,993 --> 00:46:39,090
and just kind of for the sake of demo,

941
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,994
I'm noticing something missing.

942
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:44,220
I wanna make the window
movable and resizable.

943
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,340
So I could do this with just
adding the text in there,

944
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,561
but in this case I'm gonna ask Kiro

945
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:51,952
to add this to the requirements

946
00:46:51,952 --> 00:46:55,712
so that I can then go ahead
and when it builds it,

947
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,470
the window will be movable and resizable.

948
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,002
And when I'm happy with
those requirements,

949
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:01,950
I can just click this button here

950
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,207
and we're gonna move
on to the design phase.

951
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:08,130
So Kiro's gonna analyze what it saw there.

952
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,420
It's kind of figuring out

953
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,725
that I wanted to do
something with Strands.

954
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:16,680
And so, it's gonna do a little
research in the background

955
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,260
and here it activated the Kiro Power.

956
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,660
And what the cool thing
about these powers,

957
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,890
if you're using an MCP server,

958
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,090
it might get loaded all the time,

959
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,420
but here, this is on when it's needed,

960
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,160
it will load this power

961
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,860
because it knows from what
it's working on the context

962
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,353
that it's gonna do something with Strands.

963
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:39,270
It'll deliver this requirement
design document for me.

964
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,421
I'll get some diagrams,
I'll get pseudo code in here

965
00:47:42,421 --> 00:47:44,970
and then it does this other neat thing

966
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,940
that's these correctness properties.

967
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,880
So this is a set of properties

968
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,770
that it derived from the
requirements to kind of validate

969
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,230
and tie everything together
to help us get back

970
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,856
to make sure that the
requirements that we're building

971
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:05,010
match what we asked it to.

972
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,770
So it's another way for
it to do some testing

973
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,320
and reasoning to make sure
that it's getting things right

974
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,540
and it's also really useful for you

975
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,360
when you're reviewing the design

976
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,485
to make sure that it covered everything.

977
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:19,560
And I noticed that when
I was covering this

978
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,190
that I would like a
little bit more robust.

979
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,980
I talked about input validation,

980
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,160
but I wanted some more robust validation

981
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,960
to make sure that there
was no toxic content

982
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,367
getting into my agent,

983
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:38,168
so I went ahead and
asked Kiro to add that.

984
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:42,346
And then once I'm
comfortable with the design,

985
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:44,130
we move to the next phase

986
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,253
which is creating the
tasks for the project.

987
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,866
And it gave me this option
for if I want those tasks

988
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:55,680
to be all included or do
I want just some of them

989
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,030
to be optional or not?

990
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,366
And I chose optional for making
the demo a little quicker.

991
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:04,244
But you can see these things that are gray

992
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:07,740
are optional tasks and I will get an,

993
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,940
I can turn them on if I want to.

994
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,838
I can review this and decide,
okay, some of these I want

995
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:15,393
and some of them I don't.

996
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:21,060
For the demo that I'm gonna do here too

997
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,440
I also have all these tasks

998
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,966
and I wanna make sure that
they get synced up in Jira.

999
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,870
I know not everybody loved Jira

1000
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,206
but it's a good way to
illustrate what we're doing.

1001
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,850
(Sam chuckling)

1002
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:33,870
It's a good way to illustrate

1003
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,130
the work that we're going through here.

1004
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,770
So, and also the power of the MCP,

1005
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,600
which I think a lot of
you're already familiar with.

1006
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,914
But within the IDE here I
can add this Jira MCP server

1007
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:47,430
and we have, you know, authentication

1008
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,800
so it logs into my credentials

1009
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,987
and now I'm wired up to my Jira account

1010
00:49:52,987 --> 00:49:56,115
and I can go in here and just ask Kiro

1011
00:49:56,115 --> 00:49:59,160
to take all those stories and tasks

1012
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,230
that it created in those files

1013
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,753
and create stories and
tasks for me in Jira.

1014
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,780
So this is a spot where I definitely

1015
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,830
needed to speed up the video.

1016
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,570
It took a little bit but we can go through

1017
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,922
and it created eight user stories

1018
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:16,922
and 19 sub-tasks for me all in Jira.

1019
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,230
And so, now I can track these,

1020
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,200
I can distribute this throughout
my team if I wanted to.

1021
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,768
This is a pretty small
example for this demo,

1022
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:27,630
but if you had a bigger project

1023
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,130
and you maybe wanted to parallelize

1024
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,730
some of this work throughout
your team, you can,

1025
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,310
'cause here you can see everything in Jira

1026
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,800
with the descriptions and
the details and all that

1027
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,753
of what the project was doing.

1028
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:46,380
But I might want to sync
this up a little bit

1029
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,465
with the work that I'm doing locally.

1030
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:53,130
So, Kiro has agent hooks

1031
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,635
and so the agent hooks are a way for Kiro

1032
00:50:56,635 --> 00:51:00,120
to respond to events that
happen in your environment

1033
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,232
and then call the agent and
take some action on your behalf.

1034
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:05,400
So what I've done for the demo here

1035
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,392
is I'm gonna set up a hook that will,

1036
00:51:08,392 --> 00:51:13,392
if anything changes in my
task file to check that

1037
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,982
and then do the right thing
to update my Jira for me.

1038
00:51:18,982 --> 00:51:21,750
So I can describe this
in natural language.

1039
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,150
I don't have like a whole
bunch of configuration clickies

1040
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,370
that I have to do and it figured out

1041
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,670
that it needs to monitor the task MD file.

1042
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,040
It kind of broke down to
make sure that I'm clear,

1043
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,040
I can iterate back and forth
with it about what I want

1044
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,440
and I want it to like,
if I mark a task done,

1045
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,650
make check to see is that
the last task in the story,

1046
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,080
can I mark the story done?

1047
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,580
And then it kind of updated

1048
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,329
and kept track of that
for me in my task file.

1049
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:49,860
And now that I'm ready to get working,

1050
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,360
these MD files are embedded in Kiro

1051
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,120
in a way that I can just click
on that little button there

1052
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,870
that says "Start the task,"
gives me a little indicator

1053
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,150
that tells me the progress of the task.

1054
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,090
I can watch it in the chat
dialogue and see what it's doing.

1055
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,293
If it needs permissions for
something it might ask me.

1056
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:14,550
It kind of, I probably noticed
it was a little red there,

1057
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,490
it found a, it kind ran into
an error but it figured it out

1058
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:21,242
and moved on and kind
of built that first task

1059
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:24,150
and gave me a summary of what it did.

1060
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,090
Now as I mentioned,
there's 19 tasks in here

1061
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,100
and I don't want to handhold them all.

1062
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,570
I want to go get coffee.

1063
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,635
I just told it to go ahead

1064
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:34,620
and power through the
rest of 'em and I did.

1065
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,443
I went and got a coffee and came back

1066
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:39,660
about 15, 20 minutes later and here we go.

1067
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,170
We've got all our tasks
completed with a summary,

1068
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,660
a wrap up of them, it went to Jira,

1069
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,744
it updated the status of those.

1070
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:51,863
And just for fun, I'd like,

1071
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:53,790
let me check the burn down chart.

1072
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,770
There isn't granularity in Jira

1073
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,900
that can show you what actually happened

1074
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,840
because I got all those tasks
done in less than an hour

1075
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,651
and that's the smallest granularity

1076
00:53:02,651 --> 00:53:04,293
in their burn down chart.

1077
00:53:06,857 --> 00:53:11,010
But I can go in and just in
like, look in my terminal here

1078
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,510
and kind of show you that
we can see the code here.

1079
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,050
It added initializing the Bedrock agent,

1080
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:23,370
added the agent for us,
it 2,245 lines of code

1081
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,820
and 18, over 1800 lines
of just documentation.

1082
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,537
So it also updated all my docs for me

1083
00:53:33,537 --> 00:53:37,890
and here's my app and I
got a new button on my app.

1084
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,549
I can ask it questions about my catalog

1085
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:45,510
so it knows about my,
the API for my catalog

1086
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,920
and is able to have searched
that and found what I had.

1087
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,820
But it's not perfect.

1088
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,212
The font is not in the color
that I can really read here.

1089
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:58,020
It did a fairly decent
job picking up my styles,

1090
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,295
but I don't think we had anything in there

1091
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:03,499
for this particular issue which,

1092
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:05,490
but let's just go back into Kiro

1093
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,752
and see what we can do to fix it.

1094
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:10,680
And this is where, like we can
just vibe code this one here.

1095
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,522
We can click the vibe code button.

1096
00:54:12,522 --> 00:54:14,819
I'll describe the problem that I ran into.

1097
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:19,200
Also the output from the
LOM there at the end.

1098
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,390
That big block was just
a big block of text

1099
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,030
but it's markdown so I'm asking it,

1100
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,890
can you please format the markdown

1101
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,540
so that we can get bullets and headers

1102
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,953
and all that kind of stuff?

1103
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:33,659
So it runs off and does that for me.

1104
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:36,840
We can just refresh
the app here real quick

1105
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,520
and see what it did.

1106
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,720
I don't even have to really load it.

1107
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,670
And there we go, now I can read it.

1108
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,670
I got bullets and headers
and it looks pretty good.

1109
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:49,693
But you probably noticed
I was talking over it,

1110
00:54:49,693 --> 00:54:51,423
it was very slow.

1111
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:54,960
That was not right.

1112
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,568
But that gives me a chance
to show you the CLI.

1113
00:54:57,568 --> 00:55:00,561
The CLI is, you know,
just in the terminal,

1114
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,430
there's a ton of tools in it.

1115
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,810
It's a little bit more hands held,

1116
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,790
manual kind of environment

1117
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,870
if you want to be a little bit more

1118
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,210
interactive and involved, you know,

1119
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,310
different tools for different folks.

1120
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,540
I like driving a stick shift.

1121
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,510
So for me, this is really
the world I like to be in.

1122
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,162
I really like, I use this daily

1123
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:21,660
for pretty much everything I do.

1124
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,190
You can see the list of features

1125
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,100
and a lot of experimental
stuff that's coming out.

1126
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,940
If you're using this,

1127
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,650
you should be checking the release notes

1128
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,350
pretty much every other day or so,

1129
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,940
they're using Kiro to build Kiro,

1130
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,734
so it's just, it's just fast.

1131
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:37,860
My job is to describe Kiro to you

1132
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,540
and I'm learning things from people

1133
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,670
'cause it's just so fast
that it's coming out.

1134
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,810
One of the features is
this ability to do agents

1135
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:50,178
and you can kind of bundle MCP files

1136
00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:52,680
and steering files and stuff like that

1137
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,090
and you can switch those back and forth

1138
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,950
depending on what you're working on.

1139
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,510
So maybe you can say like,

1140
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,220
you can bounce back and forth.

1141
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,530
We're doing some kind of
agent core related stuff here,

1142
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,033
so I'm using my agent core.

1143
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,411
And I told it what I was experiencing

1144
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:10,168
and it noticed that I didn't,

1145
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,180
we didn't use the streaming interface

1146
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,210
that we're blocking on
the calls from Bedrock.

1147
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,090
So it went ahead and is making the update.

1148
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,160
It's asking me if I want this showing me

1149
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,280
the coding changes that it's about to do,

1150
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,720
and I just went ahead

1151
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,730
and approved them for the sake of this.

1152
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,050
And then we'll come back in here

1153
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,080
and I'm gonna ask it a
question again about my catalog

1154
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,190
if it can go out there,

1155
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,790
and you can see this time
it was a whole lot faster.

1156
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,520
So there, that's a lot of stuff.

1157
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,870
I went through a lot really quick

1158
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,330
and I really could talk
about this all day.

1159
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,720
There's a lot of really
cool features within Kiro

1160
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,321
that you'll see if you play
with it and experiment with it.

1161
00:56:49,321 --> 00:56:52,260
Just neat little stuff like being able to

1162
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,833
automatically generate
your comments for a commit.

1163
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,290
You know, you click the button here,

1164
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,200
it knows what the context
is, what the chat has been

1165
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,930
and can create that message for you.

1166
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:07,200
We recently added check pointing as well

1167
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,840
so that if the agent just did something

1168
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,300
that you kind of don't
like and want to go back,

1169
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,473
you can revert that
checkpoint and take it back.

1170
00:57:18,114 --> 00:57:19,560
And things, like I said,

1171
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,530
things are coming out pretty
much on a daily basis.

1172
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,470
So to get a real deep dive into this,

1173
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,550
there's some other sessions

1174
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,990
at re:Invent that I would recommend.

1175
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:31,200
Just go find those, come
see us at the kiosk,

1176
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,984
but more importantly
download it, play with it.

1177
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,480
Let me know what you think.

1178
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,300
And I'm gonna give this back to Rory here.

1179
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,880
She's gonna close it out
with some more information

1180
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,060
on how you can learn more
about Kiro and get started.

1181
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,566
- Awesome!
- Thanks.

1182
00:57:46,566 --> 00:57:47,399
- Thank you.

1183
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:50,399
(audience applauds)

1184
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:55,570
How do I switch it back to
presenter mode? This one?

1185
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,960
Oh nice. All right.

1186
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,600
So getting started with
Kiro is pretty darn easy

1187
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,370
as far as you know, downloading it.

1188
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:05,010
There was an Easter egg in that demo

1189
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,900
that I don't know if you
were paying attention,

1190
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,289
but it was Kiro Powers.

1191
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:11,518
Kiro Powers is available today.

1192
00:58:11,518 --> 00:58:13,830
It was an embargoed session,

1193
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,420
so if you wanna learn
more about Kiro Powers,

1194
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,420
I would recommend going to
Kiehl's session DVT 228 tomorrow

1195
00:58:22,662 --> 00:58:26,040
to learn more how to get,
what did you call it?

1196
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,197
MCP servers on steroids.

1197
00:58:29,197 --> 00:58:30,930
Yeah, well, I don't think

1198
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,490
that's our official marketing line,

1199
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:36,150
but it is a way that we can accelerate

1200
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,920
the sort of connective tissue,

1201
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,213
especially with other AWS
services like Agent Core.

1202
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,261
So thank you very much for
attending this session.

1203
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:50,370
We would love to hear
more about what you like,

1204
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,800
what you don't like, because like I said,

1205
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,530
our development cycle has
been greatly disrupted.

1206
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,270
Take Kiro Powers.

1207
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:00,798
I don't think we had anything

1208
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,240
planned for Kiro Powers a month ago

1209
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,390
and we went from inception
all the way into production

1210
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,930
to launching it at re-Invent
in under four weeks.

1211
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,360
And that's actually
pretty slow for us now.

1212
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,360
So, these technologies
are massively disruptive,

1213
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,302
not only to our own internal processes,

1214
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:24,660
but I hope they get to
disrupt your processes as well

1215
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,690
and give you the opportunity
to do more faster

1216
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,049
and put more human in your projects.

1217
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:31,170
Thank you.
