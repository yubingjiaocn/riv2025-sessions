1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,930
- And good morning,

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,420
and we are really excited
for you to be here.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,080
We're gonna deep dive into
the Database Savings Plan

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,980
that was just announced
yesterday during Matt's keynote.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,480
Hopefully you had a chance to hear that.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,910
It was the actual last item

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,830
before the buzzer beater, right?

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,890
So we are really excited
to dive deep with that

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,850
with you today.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,260
It was one of the number one
requested features since,

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,880
for quite some time,

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
and the Compute Savings Plan
went live about six years ago.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
We've added SageMaker,

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,410
but the demand for this
Database Savings Plan

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,820
has been extraordinary.

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,060
And that's because customers
see a lot of value in it

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,400
and also want flexibility.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,500
My name is Adam Driver,
by way of introduction.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,450
Not the actor Adam Driver,

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,420
but the Adam Driver that works at AWS.

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,310
I've been here for five years.

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,000
My role is a leader in our
solution architecture team,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,340
primarily focused on databases.

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,260
So I've been living
and breathing databases

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,670
for quite some time

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,370
and have been doing it here at AWS

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,930
for the last five plus years.

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,610
And with me on stage today,

29
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,930
I've got Rick Ochs,

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,520
and I'll let him introduce himself.

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,020
- Hi, everyone, my name is Rick.

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,450
I lead the optimization product team.

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,180
So that includes products
like compute optimizer,

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,980
right sizing recommendations,

35
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,510
savings plan recommendations,

36
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,950
Cost Optimization Hub,

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,850
Savings Plan Analyzer, RI recommendations.

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,690
And I also sit on

39
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,640
the FinOps Technical Advisory Council,

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,950
representing AWS's perspective

41
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,320
and our customer's perspective

42
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,490
on the FinOps framework

43
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,260
and how it evolves over time.

44
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,130
- Great.

45
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,300
So we're gonna be your host
for the next 45, 50 minutes.

46
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,860
I love audience participation.

47
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,960
And we were talking to
some people earlier,

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,090
it'd be great to get a show of hands,

49
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,010
and I'm just a hand wavy person,

50
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,690
but to kind of understand who in the room

51
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,760
is with a FinOps group

52
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
by show of hands just to see...

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,020
Okay, there's a good quantity there.

54
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,850
And then how about DBAs?

55
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,160
Or people that are supporting databases,

56
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,870
maybe doing some Reserved Instances.

57
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,703
Okay.

58
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:03,750
And then a couple, no hands went up.

59
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,490
So I'm assuming you do both?

60
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,530
Or is there some combination there?

61
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,170
But let's just continue
the audience participation.

62
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,470
How many people, is this
your first re:Invent?

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,930
It's almost, oh, that's almost half

64
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,310
from what I can see.

65
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,010
Alright, so I don't want
everyone else to feel left out.

66
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,040
So if everybody who is
not their first re:Invent

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,830
can put their hand up, please,

68
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,770
and then put it down if it's your second.

69
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,270
Or your third.

70
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,410
You can start putting it down.

71
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,293
Fourth? Fifth?

72
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,110
We were going to see who's the longest.

73
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,110
Let's go to sixth, seventh, eighth.

74
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,273
I see two hands remaining. Ninth.

75
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,390
Oh, they both went down. Congratulations.

76
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,590
So if you have other questions,

77
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,730
we've got two people

78
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,040
that have been doing this
for nine years with us,

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,873
so thank you.

80
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,890
They can hopefully help
answer some questions.

81
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,000
But let's dive into the agenda.

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,090
We're here to talk about
how this is gonna work,

83
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,320
what it covers,

84
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,850
and more importantly,

85
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,000
some tools and technologies
and best practices

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,670
to actually make this work for you

87
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,310
and really maximize your savings.

88
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,080
So on the left, on the agenda,

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,600
is where we're gonna cover
Database Savings Plans.

90
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,070
A lot of excitement here

91
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,330
because the coverage will
really drive the engines,

92
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,950
the instance types,

93
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,160
as well as the the
provisions versus serverless.

94
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,950
So really cool capabilities

95
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,810
that the Database
Savings Plans will cover.

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,100
And most importantly,

97
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,110
the portability and flexibility.

98
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,580
If you leave here with nothing,

99
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,400
think about having flexibility

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,830
to turn new database engines on,

101
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,060
change the usage,

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,530
change how they're deployed,

103
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,410
and having that savings plan cover that

104
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,560
as you make choices in
architectural decisions.

105
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,530
We know that changes across regions,

106
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,000
the instance types,

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,620
as well as the deployment model

108
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,200
across dev test and
production are critical

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
for you to maximize that.

110
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,830
And then we wanna make sure we cover

111
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,100
the distant differences
between Reserved Instances.

112
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,800
A lot of the database
customers that I speak to

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,830
are buying specific Reserved Instances

114
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,230
for an engine type, for a workload

115
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,600
and really locking in
that three-year commitment

116
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,100
to maximize the savings.

117
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,980
We think there's some
additional flexibility

118
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,910
to go with that.

119
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,890
And Rick is actually gonna cover,

120
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,200
if you're heavy on Reserved Instances,

121
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,700
how do you migrate

122
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,880
or what is your plan to move
to a Database Savings Plan

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,560
if that's the path you choose.

124
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,600
And I think on the right side,

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,100
you will learn and hear,

126
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,690
you probably already know
a lot of these things,

127
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,910
but you'll see it in the technology.

128
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,800
We're gonna show you some live demos

129
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,010
that actually walk through
the recommendation part,

130
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,230
talk about the math behind the scenes,

131
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,980
and allow you to see some
scenarios that we've prepared

132
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,300
to kind walk through things

133
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,090
to maximize that utilization and coverage.

134
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,050
And last but not least,

135
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,940
we definitely wanna make sure you leave

136
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,503
with some best practices.

137
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,810
So why did we create the
Database Savings Plan?

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,193
Anybody?

139
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:08,505
- [Audience Member] Got
tired of us asking for it?

140
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:10,440
- (laughs) The nine-year person says

141
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,423
I'm tired of hearing us ask for it.

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,140
That's definitely customer feedback.

143
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,960
But we wanted to have that
portability and flexibility.

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,500
We wanted to make sure that
you had a pricing savings model

145
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,930
that would automatically drive savings.

146
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,900
Not that you would have to
recalculate it and figure it out,

147
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,230
but provide trustworthy recommendations

148
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,050
to allow you to drive
a one-year commitment.

149
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,720
So again, flexible,
automatic, and consistent,

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
that pricing model will drive savings.

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,250
It's different than the Reserved Instance

152
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,570
of a three-year commitment.

153
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,400
This is a one-year commitment

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,250
and there is no upfront payment.

155
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,350
And lastly, there's no waste

156
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,600
because everything that isn't covered

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,640
is billed at on-demand rates.

158
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,962
So you're really removing your waste

159
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:59,490
and maximizing your investment.

160
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,780
So let's talk coverage.

161
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,000
Everybody always wants to
know what does it cover,

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,740
what are the things it may not cover

163
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,510
in terms of corner case?

164
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,800
The Database Savings Plan

165
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,760
supports both Intel and Graviton instances

166
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,340
across Generation 7 and 8.

167
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,470
It covers both serverless,

168
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,580
kind of managed services

169
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,430
as well as your provision
deployment models.

170
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,320
And this broad coverage ensures,

171
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,870
regardless of your current architecture,

172
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,800
or as I touched on,

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,400
changes to the architecture
and future choices,

174
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
it can benefit these across
this Database Savings Plan.

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,340
So super excited about the coverage.

176
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,250
Here's a good shot to
maybe take a picture of.

177
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,970
This is the one that is
good to keep a record of.

178
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,610
This is details by database services.

179
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,710
There were a lot of data DBAs in the room.

180
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,230
I hope you're using the
right database engine

181
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,390
and maybe multiple database engines.

182
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,223
But on the left,

183
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,880
just to orient you on this slide,

184
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,130
the left covers the database services

185
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,040
that we currently support with
this Database Savings Plan.

186
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,930
There's two columns for discount.

187
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,290
One is if it's deployed
by specific instance type

188
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,270
and the other one is
if it's in a serverless

189
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,550
or more of a managed capability.

190
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,550
And then there's specific
details that talk about

191
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,790
which Generation of 7 or 8

192
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,410
and how it's covered
and what that maximum.

193
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,120
So just to walk through this.

194
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,070
Aurora, PostgreSQL at the top,

195
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,270
has a 20% discount for
instance deployments

196
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,240
and 35% for serverless.

197
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,800
So that is the highest
discount on the chart at 35%.

198
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,270
And then it calls out the details.

199
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,490
We wanna make sure that RDS SQL server,

200
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,930
we wanna make sure that the license,

201
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,010
bring your own license.

202
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,600
All of that is kind of covered

203
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,700
to the database instance usage.

204
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,740
Aurora DSQL, a little easier.

205
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,100
It's serverless only, and it's 18%.

206
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,170
And as we walk down, DynamoDB,

207
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,120
a very popular database,

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,860
is between 18 and 12,

209
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,940
and it's on-demand.

210
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,710
Throughput is 18%

211
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,460
whereas the actual
provision throughput is 12%.

212
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,910
So that's why you have two
numbers in some of those columns.

213
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,500
Again, I won't go through all of these,

214
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,790
but we're really excited

215
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,470
because the savings plan

216
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,990
covers all of those database services

217
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,520
that are listed on the slide.

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,083
Very, very powerful.

219
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,070
We think this will definitely
move the flexibility

220
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,153
and maximize savings for customers.

221
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,160
I'm gonna keep going.

222
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,100
So why is this flexibility and portability

223
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,680
that I've mentioned a few times important?

224
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,670
It's important because it
allows you to make a commitment

225
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,700
and then make changes and
choices along the way.

226
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,650
Your requirements are changing,

227
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,470
your demand and your capacity's changing,

228
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,810
and you don't have to
manage multiple commitments

229
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,470
or a particular workload
with a Reserved Instance.

230
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,720
You've got flexibility on how you do that.

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,680
So we really believe

232
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,410
the move usage between database services,

233
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,210
switch your engines,

234
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,190
as well as allowing you to bounce

235
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,050
between serverless and provisioned,

236
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,383
again, across your dev test
and production environments.

237
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,080
The change is really important

238
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,470
because we're constantly
becoming more resilient,

239
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,640
we're allowing you to move

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
across availability zones within regions,

241
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,840
stuff that you're doing today.

242
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,840
But the savings plans,
again, will allow you to have

243
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,120
that coverage and that flexibility.

244
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,110
The Reserved Instances
require specific reservations,

245
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,130
as you probably know,

246
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,840
the people that utilize those,

247
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,030
in particular instance types.

248
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,220
And this will allow you also

249
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,680
to allow you to be more dynamic.

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,650
And when it comes down in
having evolving architecture

251
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,150
that maximizes and meets

252
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,370
the business requirements you have today

253
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,410
and will allow you to adopt
to those in the future.

254
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,440
So again, flexibility, portability,

255
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,690
and this move switch, change, and adopt

256
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,620
allows you some really
good choices going forward

257
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,170
with the Database Savings Plan.

258
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,980
The next slide.

259
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,920
Again, the maximum saving? 35%.

260
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,050
Which service was that?

261
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,980
Yeah, from the last slide.

262
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,450
Thank you. Aurora.

263
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,700
So we're really excited about that.

264
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,110
It's a one-year commitment,

265
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,780
which is different than
the Reserved Instances,

266
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,430
which are three-year commitment.

267
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,353
And then there's no upfront payment.

268
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,240
There's some advanced pay options.

269
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,570
But again, the tagline I want
you to take away from this

270
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,780
is the savings and then
there's on-demand pricing

271
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,760
for anything else that is not covered

272
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
with the Database Savings Plan.

273
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,810
So really, really excited about that,

274
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,660
and, again, driving that flexibility.

275
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,150
How does it work compared
to Reserved Instances?

276
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,100
And I've talked about this a little bit,

277
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,450
and I don't know how many people

278
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,880
are really comfortable
with Reserved Instances,

279
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,690
but I wanted to just call
out just the big differences.

280
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,990
The first one is that the
Database Savings Plans

281
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,640
work with your existing,

282
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,360
your specific pricing programs
that you have in place.

283
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,610
They can be utilized with your discount

284
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,370
and your pricing agreements
for additional savings.

285
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,560
However, the Database Savings Plans

286
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,420
and the database Reserved Instances

287
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,580
cannot be combined on the same workload.

288
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,490
So there does have to be a
choice based on the workload

289
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,290
in terms of how you're actually
providing that discount.

290
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
Across dev test and
prod is a good example.

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,590
but let's talk a little bit more detail

292
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,690
on when should I use one or the other.

293
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,150
And then, again, the
common question we get

294
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,340
is if I'm using a lot
of Reserved Instances,

295
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
how do I migrate?

296
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,810
What is my strategy to get
to the Database Savings Plan

297
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,520
if that's where I want to end up?

298
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,930
So on the left here,

299
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,510
we think we've netted it out very clear

300
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,880
that you should use the savings plan

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,500
if you want to be able to move

302
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,650
between database services
and instance types

303
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,960
and we also want the ability

304
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,360
to adopt new technology really quickly

305
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,610
and try a new database service

306
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,740
without managing separate commitments

307
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,650
is a classic reason to use
the Database Savings Plan.

308
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,220
And then the goal is to
simplify your cost management

309
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,740
across all these database services.

310
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,250
However, there makes sense
to use Reserved Instances

311
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,430
for those of you that have
a stable, predictable,

312
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,300
known workload on specific instance types

313
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,970
that you've already implemented

314
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,280
and is not very spiky and just as,

315
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,990
and you know exactly what it is,

316
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,290
it makes sense to have a
three-year longer commitment

317
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,510
that maximizes even further discounts.

318
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,830
As I talked about,

319
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,860
you do need a reservation
for those Reserved Instances,

320
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,203
whereas the Database
Savings Plan, you don't.

321
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,980
At this point, I'm gonna
turn it over to Rick.

322
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,110
I think we've covered
just kind of what it is

323
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,400
and what the coverage is

324
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,080
and some of the flexibility,

325
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,370
and now I'll turn it over to Rick

326
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,840
to kind of dive a little deeper.

327
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,953
Thanks, Adam.
- Sure.

328
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,800
- So, as we were building
Database Savings Plans,

329
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,390
we talked to a lot of customers

330
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,730
about how they do their
purchasing strategies

331
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,620
and planning for compute savings plans

332
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,480
and instant savings plans as well

333
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,020
to learn about the pipeline and workflow

334
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,870
and the process of how do you
make the purchase decision,

335
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,520
how do you do your purchase analysis,

336
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,550
and then how do you track the
success of these purchases

337
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,650
after you've made that purchase.

338
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,140
So we have a little bit
of a lifecycle slide here

339
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,703
that shows the process.

340
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,210
First, determining what savings plan

341
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,200
you're going to purchase.

342
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,970
How much...

343
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,620
In this specific case,

344
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,380
there's less decisions you have to make

345
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,770
because it's already one-year, no upfront,

346
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,780
but how much you purchase

347
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,750
is still a really big part
of the puzzle to solve.

348
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,510
And once you add that to
cart and make the purchase,

349
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,910
then it becomes a bit of a tracking game

350
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,000
where you need to track
coverage, utilization,

351
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,130
and the discount you're
receiving from that savings plan

352
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,200
to make sure it's meeting the needs

353
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,520
and the expectations you had

354
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,350
when you made your purchase.

355
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,040
And then as you track your
coverage and utilization,

356
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,920
which we'll get into in
more details and depth

357
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,450
in a few slides,

358
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,720
you may find that you want
additional savings plans.

359
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,270
Say, there's more on-demand
spend to go cover,

360
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,983
there's more savings to go cover.

361
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,620
Tracking the coverage and utilization

362
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,350
will help you decide
when it's time to go back

363
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,300
to the beginning of this pipeline

364
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,940
and make some new purchase decisions

365
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,863
for your savings plan opportunities.

366
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,690
So we have a couple of
different options or methods

367
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,520
for purchasing new savings plans.

368
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,070
We have a recommendation product.

369
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,480
This is the same product that

370
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,610
if you're used to compute
savings plans today,

371
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,100
it's the same product, same experience,

372
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,840
same console location.

373
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,170
So hopefully for those of you
experienced and comfortable

374
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,320
with the savings plan product experience,

375
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,620
this won't be a new thing for you.

376
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,290
The idea is to make this
easy and comfortable

377
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,360
so there's not a lot of overhead

378
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,490
with managing and purchasing commitments.

379
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,330
So those recommendations are a
great starting point for you.

380
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,580
Those recommendations will look at

381
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,520
all of your historical on-demand usage

382
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,380
and find the most optimal

383
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,200
highest discount purchase amount for you

384
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,910
based on that historical usage.

385
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
And you can just click add to cart

386
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,350
and you're off to the
race in saving money.

387
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,910
For more advanced users,

388
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,390
you probably want to test out
different purchase amounts,

389
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,250
maybe look at different specific

390
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,230
periods of time in your history.

391
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,810
And we have a new product we
announced last year re:Invent

392
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,240
called Savings Plan Purchase Analyzer.

393
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
This has been a very popular
tool for our FinOps customers

394
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,780
that are doing a lot of analysis
and purchasing decisions

395
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,780
who maybe wanna layer different
savings plans together

396
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,970
or stagger their purchases.

397
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,230
This product helps

398
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,110
because it'll show you the
same kind of information,

399
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,130
how much you're gonna buy,

400
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,380
how much discount you're gonna get,

401
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,000
the coverage and the utilization

402
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,460
for any purchase amount you want.

403
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,940
And so that's maybe a
more advanced approach,

404
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,430
but what's interesting is you
can kind of easily transition

405
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,340
from the recommendations
to Purchase Analyzer

406
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,800
and maybe test out
different purchase amounts

407
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,633
quickly and easily

408
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,880
by moving between the
two product experiences.

409
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,910
So as we discussed,

410
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,650
the first question is how,

411
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,910
what are you going to purchase?

412
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,750
In this specific case,

413
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,550
Database Savings Plans.

414
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,450
But we really want to know
how much savings plan?

415
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,920
Is there any other details?

416
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,753
Is it specific?

417
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,460
Are you going to buy for
a specific linked account?

418
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,310
Are you going to buy a savings
plan for your payer account,

419
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,930
which will cover all of the usage

420
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,640
in all of your linked accounts?

421
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,070
And so that decision,
what are you purchasing,

422
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,040
whether that's maybe a Reserved
Instance or a savings plan.

423
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,900
Then it goes to how much to purchase,

424
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,340
which we have a recommendation

425
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,710
and Savings Plan Analyzer products for.

426
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,410
And then tracking usage.

427
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,210
In the Billing and Cost
Management console,

428
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,190
we have coverage and utilization
reports for savings plans.

429
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,890
So you can track over time, continuously,

430
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,810
how much savings you're getting

431
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,670
and what percentage of your usage

432
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,043
is covered by your commitments.

433
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,310
- Hey, Rick, a question that we get a lot

434
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,810
is how do we,

435
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,880
what's the math with that recommendation?

436
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
I know we produce a recommendation,

437
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,260
but what's the math behind that,

438
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,700
and we know it's trustworthy,

439
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,220
but how trustworthy is it?

440
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,053
- That's a great question.

441
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,700
So we get that question
from a lot of FinOps teams

442
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,410
that are trying to figure out, like,

443
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,300
should I build a spreadsheet

444
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,670
and look at my on-demand cost myself

445
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,580
and download the ker and look at it.

446
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,670
And the idea behind the recommendation

447
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,260
is we want to do that for you.

448
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,950
It's a lot of heavy lifting
and it's a lot of math.

449
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,160
And so in our recommendation algorithm,

450
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,730
we use something called a
golden-section search algorithm,

451
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,720
which is actually,

452
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,270
like, you can open up
Google and type it in

453
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,280
and you'll see golden-section search

454
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,050
is a very common algorithm,

455
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,940
but what it's doing is it's testing

456
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,250
a bunch of different purchase sizes

457
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,370
and finding the one with the
highest amount of savings.

458
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,260
And it doesn't necessarily mean

459
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,460
that it's finding the low usage amount,

460
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,890
because as your usage accrues over time,

461
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,480
you're gonna have peaks and dips,

462
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,010
especially with serverless,

463
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,180
because you may be having,

464
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,520
like, spiky workloads during the day,

465
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,900
and during nights and weekends,

466
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,733
you have no load.

467
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:08,670
Or maybe you're a company
that has a lot of usage

468
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,740
weekends and nights, as an example.

469
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,440
And so these spikes and dips in your usage

470
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,750
mean that a recommendation will find

471
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,180
how much of those spikes
and dips you should cover

472
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,550
for the maximum dollar amount of savings.

473
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,500
And so the recommendation in this graph

474
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,880
is sort of in the middle there.

475
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,770
And if you purchase more
than the recommendation,

476
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,020
you'll actually net a
little bit less savings.

477
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,820
And if you purchase less
than the recommendation,

478
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,340
you will also net a
little bit less savings.

479
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,310
So the recommendation is
designed to find, mathematically,

480
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,640
the highest dollar amount
of savings that's available

481
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,070
based on your historical usage.

482
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,600
And you can pick in the recommendation

483
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,420
7, 30, or 60 days look back period.

484
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,570
So if you have changes in
your environment recently,

485
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,940
you can kind of pick the window of time

486
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,170
that is more representative

487
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,320
of what you believe will
be your future usage.

488
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,700
- [Adam] And even with
custom dates, right,

489
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,590
it's not just fixed, it's-
- So, yeah, well,

490
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,850
so in Savings Plan Analyzer,

491
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,157
you can do custom dates, which is a,

492
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,340
it's a nifty trick,

493
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,083
and I'll demo that as well.

494
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,020
So as an example,

495
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,280
we made a little bit of an image

496
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,630
to show that, like,

497
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,750
we analytically graph out how much savings

498
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,070
or what the total cost is

499
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,090
and find the absolute lowest point of cost

500
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,010
for what specific purchases you can make.

501
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,180
And that's what

502
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,090
our savings plan
recommendation algorithm does.

503
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,420
And it's very important
that we're transparent

504
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,340
with how the recommendation is generated

505
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,680
by showing the utilization graph,

506
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,880
the cost graph,

507
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,120
so that way you can always
double check the math yourself.

508
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,820
But what's really cool is we actually take

509
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,510
a little bit of your monthly bill end code

510
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,030
that we run to publish the bill,

511
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,650
and we run the part of it

512
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,080
that calculates your savings plans

513
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,880
being applied against your resources.

514
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,810
So we actually run

515
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,510
a part of the end of
month bill computation

516
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,830
when we generate the recommendations

517
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,610
to double check that it's going
to yield exactly the savings

518
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,580
as long as your usage is similar

519
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,480
to what it was in the lookback period.

520
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,850
So what changed?

521
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,860
What's new in the console?

522
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,950
How many of you are familiar
with the recommendations

523
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,750
or Savings Plan Analyzer products

524
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,223
in the console today?

525
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,070
- Good number, yeah.
- Okay, awesome.

526
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,570
I like seeing that.

527
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,680
You'll see now,

528
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,170
as of yesterday at, like, 8:00 AM,

529
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,640
a new option in the recommendations
and purchase analyzer.

530
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,050
You'll see Database Savings Plans

531
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,060
is now an option for you to click

532
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,500
and get those recommendations.

533
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,270
The recommendations are already generated

534
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,620
and available on all of your accounts

535
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,380
where there is eligible on-demand usage.

536
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,003
So you can select that,

537
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,910
you'll immediately see
these recommendations

538
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,320
populate on the bottom,

539
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,330
and then you can click View Details

540
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,040
on these recommendations.

541
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,350
Now there's a lot of colors
and graphs on the slide,

542
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,840
so we're gonna go through it individually.

543
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,680
You'll see the first graph
on a new recommendation

544
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,660
is how much you're currently covering

545
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,610
with existing savings plans,

546
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,390
how much the recommendation
is advising you to purchase

547
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,430
to cover additional on-demand,

548
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,170
and what is the remaining on demand

549
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,260
that is not ideal to
cover with a commitment

550
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,380
because the discounter
savings is not positive.

551
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,513
So that is the left graph.

552
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,350
And you can just track over
time and understand, like,

553
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,690
okay, here's how much
I'm gonna have leftover

554
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,060
and here's how much
coverage I'm going to get.

555
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,520
Note that your FinOps teams will love you

556
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,380
if you make a lot of these purchases

557
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,480
because the bill month over month

558
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,910
gets much more stable and consistent

559
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,250
when you convert your on-demand spend

560
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,980
to a flat hourly rate savings plan.

561
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,980
So your finance people will love this,

562
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,420
the people that read the bill

563
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,910
and try to make sense
of it and explain it,

564
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,050
having a nice consistent
flat rate hourly fee

565
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,480
is much easier to handle

566
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,150
because you have less
variability in your spend.

567
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,870
On the right side of the screen
we have the coverage graph.

568
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,200
This will show you how much
of your on demand spend

569
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,650
is being covered by this
newly recommended commitment.

570
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,900
And it will also show you
what your current coverage is.

571
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,780
So if you already have some
savings plans for databases...

572
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,830
Maybe not, but...

573
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,450
Although I did have
some customers yesterday

574
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,010
already make savings plan purchases,

575
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,320
which is pretty cool.
- All right.

576
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,790
- You'll see your current coverage

577
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,170
and then what the coverage would be

578
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,080
if you purchased the newly
recommended savings plan.

579
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,520
So coverage is very important.

580
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,730
For those of you in the
audience that are FinOps,

581
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,830
you know a lot of companies target

582
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,200
a certain average coverage percentage.

583
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,610
They want to cover 70, 80,
90% of their on-demand spend.

584
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,470
They want to leave a little bit left over

585
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,560
for maybe if they're gonna
run an optimization campaign

586
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,070
like migrating to Graviton
or going to serverless.

587
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,420
Those are important elements
of how to make your decision.

588
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,380
And then on the bottom right

589
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,930
you'll see how much of this savings plan

590
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,820
will be consumed or used.

591
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,190
And there may be dips in this graph,

592
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,200
and it's important to note

593
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,590
that it's okay to have dips in utilization

594
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,383
and have a little bit of
savings plan go unused.

595
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,010
- [Adam] I'm always drawn
to this utilization chart

596
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,270
in the lower right

597
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,250
and what Rick just touched on.

598
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,170
For those of you that
might not be in FinOps,

599
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,880
why wouldn't I just do a blanket coverage,

600
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,130
ensure that I had a
hundred percent coverage

601
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,440
or 105% coverage, Rick,

602
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,790
versus that optimal amount?

603
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,490
- [Rick] You can either, like, optimize

604
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,740
for max coverage or utilization

605
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,760
and you kind of have to pick

606
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,380
which one's more important to you.

607
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,950
But if you maximize your utilization,

608
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,080
it means you're buying
a smaller savings plan

609
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,910
that's always gonna be fully used.

610
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,210
It means you have a lot more
leftover on-demand spend

611
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,630
that you're paying the
full on-demand price for

612
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,370
instead of having it under commitment.

613
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,800
So we do talk to customers

614
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,410
that they see an unused savings plan

615
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,720
and they're like, "We don't want that."

616
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
But you actually get more savings

617
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,770
if you purchase the recommended amount,

618
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,073
which doesn't always have a
hundred percent utilization.

619
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,493
- [Adam] Makes a lot of sense.

620
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,580
Okay, so we talked a little bit about

621
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,720
how the recommendations work.

622
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,030
Now we're gonna talk
about how savings plans

623
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,743
apply to your usage.

624
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,460
When you're using purchase
analyzer or recommendations

625
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,690
or even when your bill,

626
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,763
your month end bill process is running,

627
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,430
savings plans will apply

628
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,880
to the highest discount resources first.

629
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,750
This is really important,

630
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,880
because, as Adam mentioned,

631
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,740
serverless has a higher discount.

632
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,990
35% for RDS and Aurora.

633
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,250
That's an amazing discount.

634
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,130
We want to make sure you
get absolutely every dollar

635
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,320
of that higher discount first.

636
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,320
What that means is that 35%
Aurora serverless pricing

637
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,690
will always consume the savings plan first

638
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,140
and then it'll go down the
list in the discount amount.

639
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,060
Meaning, first we consume
35% Aurora serverless,

640
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,550
then ElastiCache, and then DynamoDB,

641
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,250
and it steps down by the discount percent.

642
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,170
So as you purchase more

643
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,390
and push your savings
plan coverage higher,

644
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,460
you get sort of like diminishing returns

645
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,120
as you get closer and closer
to your break even point

646
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,130
or your highest ROI.

647
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,050
So you will get the highest savings

648
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,210
with smaller savings plans,

649
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,780
but the recommendation
will calculate all of that

650
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,930
and tell you what the
ideal purchase amount is

651
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,953
for max savings.

652
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,790
So how do we see customers
using savings plans today?

653
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,860
This is important because
a lot of companies

654
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,870
have invested time and analysis and effort

655
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,330
into coming up with purchasing strategies

656
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,660
and plans for how to approach

657
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,940
fairly expensive and important investments

658
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,890
for the future of their cloud spend.

659
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,570
What we see is laddering
or incremental purchasing

660
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,720
becoming a very popular
method for FinOps teams.

661
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,010
And what this means is

662
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,170
you can purchase a savings plan right now

663
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,970
before you leave the conference

664
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,860
and start saving immediately.

665
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,330
And it doesn't have to be

666
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,160
the full recommended purchase amount,

667
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,660
it can be a smaller amount.

668
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,150
You'll immediately get some savings,

669
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,980
especially if you're running serverless,

670
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,360
with a pretty high discount amount,

671
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,193
the highest discount amount,

672
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:18,330
'cause it'll be applied first.

673
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,520
And you can always purchase more.

674
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,470
There's really not a downside

675
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,140
to staggering or layering
purchases together

676
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,420
because you can always revisit,

677
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,520
and if utilization changes or grows,

678
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,080
you can make another purchase.

679
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,040
There's not really a downside.

680
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,780
All of the savings
plans will work together

681
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,420
and apply to all of your usage together.

682
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,370
So purchasing incrementally,

683
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,520
whether that's monthly,
sometimes quarterly,

684
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,960
some customers, we actually see

685
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,390
weekly savings plan purchases.

686
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,410
And this is really cool

687
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,290
because for those of you that
have been patiently waiting

688
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,270
for an RI to expire

689
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,180
and kind of getting a
little antsy with that,

690
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,400
having incremental purchases means

691
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,400
you're not gonna have one giant
expiration of a commitment

692
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,520
12 months from now

693
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,530
that you have to wait for,

694
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,450
and you'll have kind of more staggered

695
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,400
expirations of your commitments

696
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,740
in case maybe your usage drops, right?

697
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,740
So this is a nice way to
get even more flexibility

698
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,810
out of your savings plan purchases

699
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,420
by laddering and staggering them together

700
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,000
to kind of build up to
the amount of coverage

701
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,713
you want for your spend.

702
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,073
So how do we move from Reserved
Instances to savings plans?

703
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,860
So we know a lot of customers

704
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,040
use Reserved Instances for RDS,

705
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,770
and those are one- or
three-year commitments

706
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,080
that you can make to receive a discount

707
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,970
for a specific instance type

708
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,533
in a specific region or zone.

709
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,330
And what we heard is a lot of customers

710
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:55,200
really like migrating to Graviton

711
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,140
or moving to the newest
instance family and generation

712
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,940
to get better CPU performance,

713
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,390
which also allows you to use
things like compute optimizer,

714
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,040
right size recommendations,

715
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,723
personal fan of that.

716
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,550
So making sure that you
have that flexibility

717
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,040
to make those changes like
Adam talked about that,

718
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,870
that if you're gonna migrate,

719
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,450
maybe change database services,

720
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,676
go to serverless,

721
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:21,333
that flexibility was key.

722
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,900
And so deciding your
overall commitment strategy

723
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,720
of where you're gonna be making
Reserved Instance purchases

724
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,740
for those stable workloads

725
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,360
that are not gonna change for a long time,

726
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,340
and then using savings plans

727
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,550
to essentially layer on
top for all of your usage

728
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,030
that may be more flexible
or change over time.

729
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,500
And so you can do both.

730
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,090
You can use your Reserved Instances

731
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,970
for your stable long-term workloads.

732
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,540
But for that usage that maybe
you need more flexibility

733
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,820
or you have plans to move to Graviton

734
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,280
or do optimization programs,

735
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,493
that savings plan flexibility
is really important for you.

736
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,050
So deciding on a commitment
strategy is important.

737
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,830
Establishing what does your
utilization look like over time,

738
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,390
what does your spend look like over time,

739
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,150
and how much of that do you want to cover.

740
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,553
So as you're going through this process,

741
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:14,580
the most important part
of Database Savings Plans

742
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,930
is that it's not one service,

743
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,540
it is nine services of usage.

744
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,720
This allows us to stack the usage

745
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,880
from all of these services together

746
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,680
and cover more of it because,

747
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,380
say, your DynamoDB usage is dipping

748
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,690
but maybe your RDS usage is increasing

749
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,640
certain hours of the week.

750
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,370
By stacking all of this usage together,

751
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,410
we can cover more of that usage

752
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,500
with a single savings plan
or multiple savings plans.

753
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,290
We believe will allow
you to purchase and cover

754
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,470
more of your usage with more discounts.

755
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,790
And especially for serverless,

756
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,580
which did not have a
discount offering previously,

757
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,320
this is a brand new discount.

758
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,690
So we believe this will save
a lot for our customers,

759
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,120
and we're really excited
to see it in action.

760
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,710
So combining usage

761
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,200
for all of your database services together

762
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,180
will allow you to make bigger purchases

763
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,563
and achieve more savings.

764
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,180
So you can also...

765
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,770
So you can look at the individual services

766
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,820
and usage for the services,

767
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,550
you can make Database
Savings Plan purchases

768
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,810
for those services,

769
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,400
or you can just combine

770
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,050
and look at all of that usage together,

771
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,210
which is what we do in the recommendations

772
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,163
and Savings Plan Analyzer tool.

773
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,880
So moving from Reserved
Instances to savings plans,

774
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,020
I think one of the interesting
migration strategies

775
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,327
would be to wait for them
to expire for each service

776
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,460
and then you take that on-demand usage

777
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,750
once it frees up

778
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,060
and comes off of a Reserved Instance.

779
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,180
And then you can start to
put together a purchase plan

780
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,090
and gather that utilization information.

781
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,720
And maybe if you would like to
repurchase Reserved Instances

782
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,370
for those stable workloads

783
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,520
and then convert the
rest to savings plans.

784
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,260
So purchasing for maybe
sort of like an 80% target,

785
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,340
get your coverage,

786
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,160
get your highest discount
usage done first,

787
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,640
and then you can leave that 20%

788
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,630
for maybe future plans on
modernization, right sizing.

789
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,520
Switching to Aurora I/O-Optimized,

790
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,570
another great option.

791
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,400
So one way to think about this

792
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,540
is to track the expiration
dates of your Reserved Instances

793
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,280
for each of your services.

794
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,450
So in the RI inventory console,

795
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,630
in the cost management console,

796
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,970
you can track the expiration dates

797
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,920
of all of your Reserved Instances

798
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,290
and then make a plan for aggregating

799
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,730
all of that usage together

800
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,950
for all of those services

801
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,680
and then start covering
them with savings plans.

802
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,000
So by tracking all of that,

803
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,250
we can convert all of the usage

804
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,170
from all of these different services

805
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,630
into one pool of usage and spend

806
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,510
for all of these nine database services,

807
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,543
and track and manage them
to make your purchases.

808
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,653
We talked a little bit about staggering.

809
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,120
So here's a little bit
of a visual example.

810
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,060
As your Reserved Instances expire

811
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,820
or as you maybe work

812
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,470
with a lot of your
different engineering teams

813
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,260
and understand what
resources they're running

814
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,520
and how they're running them,

815
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,010
you can incrementally add and increase

816
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,750
the amount of savings
plan coverage over time

817
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,193
by making those purchases.

818
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,490
Here's an example of over
time as your RIs expire.

819
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,040
You can either repurchase RIs,

820
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,040
you can convert to savings plan spend,

821
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,520
and by doing so you can
increase the amount of spend

822
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,970
that is covered by a discount
or a commitment over time,

823
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,910
yielding a higher total amount of savings.

824
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,430
We feel that with Reserved Instances,

825
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,920
a lot of customers were
hesitant to make that purchase

826
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,650
because you maybe didn't
have high confidence

827
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,390
in knowing the future of, like,

828
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,100
maybe a new instance type comes out,

829
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,010
we would like to optimize or migrate to,

830
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,660
or we're not sure if this workload

831
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,730
is gonna exist in six months.

832
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,040
And that flexibility of
Database Savings Plans

833
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,500
will provide some sort of insurance.

834
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,050
So you know you can utilize that discount

835
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,673
with any other resource type.

836
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,170
Once you've made your
purchases in the console,

837
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,140
you can go to the Billing
and Cost Management,

838
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,690
cost and utilization reports.

839
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,240
Here's an example of what it looks like

840
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
after you've made your purchases

841
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,630
and you would like to track

842
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,130
how much of that spend

843
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,860
is being covered by a new savings plan.

844
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,700
This is really important

845
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,340
because if your coverage starts to dip,

846
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,130
that's a great opportunity
to go and analyze

847
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,800
whether you would like to
make additional purchases,

848
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,380
or maybe some engineering teams

849
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,510
spun up some new resources

850
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,070
and they're utilizing those resources

851
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,970
for a brief period of time.

852
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,830
Maybe they're testing something out,

853
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,560
maybe they're kicking the
tires on a different service,

854
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,450
or scale testing or load testing.

855
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,060
and understanding why the coverage dip,

856
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,220
coverage has a dip is important

857
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,660
because it may not be a moment

858
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,550
where you wanna make a purchase for that.

859
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,190
It may be something
where an engineering team

860
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,953
is testing something or
trying something out.

861
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,663
Okay, we're gonna switch over to demo now.

862
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,413
- I'll let you do the demo.

863
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,990
- Okay, so here's the Billing
and Cost Management console.

864
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,630
For those of you in the FinOps space,

865
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sure you're very comfortable
and familiar with this.

866
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,660
For those of you with a more
of a database background,

867
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,430
a non-financial background,

868
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,480
this is the location that
all of our FinOps customers

869
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,530
spend a ton of time

870
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,320
to look at and understand
their costs, their spend,

871
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,040
usage data details, recommendations.

872
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,200
You'll also see we have a product in here

873
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,030
called Cost Optimization Hub.

874
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,060
That'll get you Aurora
I/O-Optimize recommendations,

875
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,190
RDS right size recommendations,

876
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,750
IDL recommendations

877
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,750
to help you optimize and save even more.

878
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,550
In the Billing and Cost
Management console,

879
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,600
on the left side,

880
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,840
you'll see recommendations
and purchase analyzer.

881
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,430
Again, these are the same products

882
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,410
that you're experiencing
today, or have today,

883
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,330
or the last several years

884
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,220
for compute savings plans

885
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,350
and instant savings plans purchases.

886
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,640
So there's not really

887
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,190
a new product experience
here, necessarily.

888
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,530
We're just improving these products

889
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,333
to include Database Savings Plans.

890
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,600
As you saw in the slides,

891
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,970
we now have a new Database
Savings Plan option

892
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,010
in the recommendations.

893
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,030
Can you all see that screen?

894
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,590
It's a little small.

895
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,423
Yeah? Okay.

896
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,430
Once you select Database Savings Plans,

897
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,320
we will show you a recommendation

898
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,840
that we've already generated for you.

899
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,350
In this case, I can save $315 a month

900
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,080
on a recommended purchase.

901
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,493
And you can pick,

902
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,240
do I want a recommendation
for the payer level,

903
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,100
a specific linked account,

904
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,520
and do I want it based
on 7, 30, or 60 days?

905
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,250
We also have options for
savings plan term and option.

906
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,530
Those only apply to compute
and instant savings plans.

907
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,520
For Database Savings Plans,

908
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
they are locked at one year, no upfront.

909
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,870
So in this case,

910
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,820
I've increased my usage
a lot in the last week

911
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,380
in preparation for re:Invent.

912
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,730
So I'm going to pick seven days

913
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,130
'cause I think that usage is more

914
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,490
what I expect to have in my
environment going forward.

915
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,320
So I picked seven days.

916
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,420
And then we're gonna look
at this recommendation

917
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,463
and see what it tells me to purchase.

918
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,040
In this case, I've got some spikes.

919
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,171
I've actually been running

920
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:52,770
some serverless in my environment

921
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,480
for the last week or so.

922
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,190
I wanted to show what it looks like

923
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,710
to have a highly dynamic environment.

924
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,890
If you look at the recommendations
in your payer account

925
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,810
or for an account with a lot of usage,

926
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,340
you'll see lots of spikes and dips,

927
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,750
especially if you're running serverless

928
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,810
or say you're doing RDS auto pausing.

929
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,760
Does anybody in the audience do that

930
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,390
where you pause your RDS
instances for cost savings

931
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,130
for up to seven days at a time?

932
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:17,963
Okay, that's great.

933
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:21,030
So you're gonna see dips
and peaks in your usage

934
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,070
and it's really important
that the analysis

935
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,380
and the recommendations account for that.

936
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,740
So here I've got some dips
and some peaks in my usage.

937
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,680
And in this case, over
the last seven days,

938
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,600
I can save about 2000 a month

939
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,310
or 9% of the cost

940
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,143
just on my last seven days of usage.

941
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,090
But you'll see these dips

942
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,640
actually go below the purchase amount.

943
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,980
So I want to understand
what's happening here.

944
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,560
And so I can click over
to the coverage graph.

945
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,460
This is the same graph

946
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,110
we showed a little bit
earlier in the slides,

947
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,480
but I want to know what percentage

948
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,030
of the spend or usage I have

949
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,037
is going to be covered by
this new recommendation.

950
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:59,040
And I can see that it kind of dips

951
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,850
between 76% and a hundred percent.

952
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,260
So that's sort of my peak to mean,

953
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,380
that's my high and my
low of usage over time,

954
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,680
and that's what a new
savings plan would cover

955
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,093
when it comes to my spent.

956
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,420
Then I want to track

957
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,300
how much of this savings
plan is being consumed.

958
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,730
Am I leaving any of that
savings plan on the table?

959
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,790
Now again, I would advise you
not to think of it as waste

960
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,430
because you still get a
higher amount of savings.

961
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,693
I'll give you an example.

962
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,340
Say you turn an instance
off on the weekends

963
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,320
for say 20% of the time,

964
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,110
but you have a 25% option to save.

965
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,210
It's still worthwhile to buy

966
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,900
a commitment or a discount vehicle

967
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,330
because that 5% extra savings

968
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,340
will yield you a lower total bill.

969
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,410
But it means your
commitment might not be used

970
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,460
a hundred percent of the time,

971
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,170
and that's perfectly okay

972
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,720
because the whole idea
with optimization here

973
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,270
is to ultimately lower the bill.

974
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,070
We wanna see that number
as low as possible

975
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,140
with no impact on performance

976
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,083
and availability of your
workloads for your customers.

977
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,140
So seeing utilization
below a hundred percent,

978
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,760
like we talked about earlier,

979
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,740
it's okay, don't run from it,

980
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,390
it's not the boogeyman.

981
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,683
Some FinOps teams,

982
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,830
they chase this down to zero,

983
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,500
they want zero unused commitments,

984
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,560
and we recommend targeting
your total savings amount

985
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
or your coverage amount instead.

986
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,820
So if I scroll down,

987
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,893
you can see some additional details.

988
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,260
These won't really change a whole lot

989
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,370
for Database Savings Plans,

990
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,350
but you can see if this recommendation

991
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,790
is at the payer level,

992
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,100
the lookback period,

993
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,410
the average hourly utilization by percent

994
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,050
if you want to target
a specific percentage.

995
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,040
And same with coverage.

996
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,520
You can see an average
coverage percent here.

997
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,810
Again, a lot of FinOps teams

998
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,000
will target a specific number here

999
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,260
because they want to cover

1000
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,840
a certain percentage of their spend

1001
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,753
to minimize risk and
maximize the flexibility.

1002
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,690
Okay, so that's the recommendation.

1003
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,840
So that's the out of the box experience

1004
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,540
for what we've already
generated for you today

1005
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,920
in your console.

1006
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,960
But, you know, if I know

1007
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,780
that I've got like some usage patterns

1008
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,150
that are more representative,

1009
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,270
I can click over here to purchase analyzer

1010
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,070
and now I've got a lot more control

1011
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,780
over the engine that populates

1012
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,480
and calculates the recommendation.

1013
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,450
And I can actually come in here

1014
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,330
and I can change the lookback period

1015
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,670
to any custom range I want.

1016
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,090
And I was running a lot of server lists

1017
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,860
and higher usage

1018
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,260
between the 28th and the first.

1019
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,020
I was running some usage over the weekend.

1020
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,200
So I can pick this specific date range

1021
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,453
and then I can run the
recommendation engine again.

1022
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,050
So we're gonna run analysis.

1023
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,490
And it's gonna take a few seconds

1024
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,020
because it runs a portion

1025
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,560
of your month end billing process code,

1026
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,120
which applies and simulates

1027
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,120
all of how the savings plans will apply.

1028
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,380
And once that runs,

1029
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,990
you're gonna get that same set of graphs.

1030
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,520
In this case, it's telling me

1031
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,680
there is a flat rate purchase to make

1032
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,600
that will fully cover
everything of $29 an hour.

1033
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,800
That's a pretty big savings plan

1034
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,170
and it's gonna save me over $5,000 a month

1035
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,910
and it's gonna, estimated,

1036
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,610
save me 21% off of my spend.

1037
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:30,270
So again, the more
serverless you're using,

1038
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,490
you're gonna have higher discount amounts

1039
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,260
and it's gonna be consumed first,

1040
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,690
and so you'll see this number go up.

1041
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,990
But I know that I had some
dips over this period of time

1042
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,550
and so I wanna understand that.

1043
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,850
So I can come into
utilization to understand

1044
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,400
how much of that new savings
plan is gonna be consumed.

1045
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,720
And this may be an opportunity

1046
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,580
actually as well for optimization

1047
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,660
where if I've got some periods
of time of low utilization,

1048
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,050
I can schedule ETLs or backup jobs

1049
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,920
or some of that sort of other
usage in those time periods

1050
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,930
to consume that savings plan as well

1051
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,780
to maximize your discounts even more.

1052
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,060
Oka, so that's what it looks like

1053
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,590
to customize your lookback period.

1054
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,600
But what if, you know,

1055
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,330
I'm not sure if that's the amount I want,

1056
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,440
and, you know, $29 an
hour is a big commitment

1057
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,510
and I have to go get
approval from finance,

1058
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,440
and I don't wanna do that,

1059
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,500
but I have auto approval for
anything under $15 an hour.

1060
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,750
So I'm just gonna type in $15 an hour

1061
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,880
and I can run that same exact analysis.

1062
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,650
And it's going to calculate

1063
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,260
all of the savings
plans per hour coverage,

1064
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,973
utilization and savings amounts.

1065
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,363
And here we go.

1066
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,470
We can see the leftover on-demand usage

1067
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,150
that's still gonna be out there.

1068
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,460
And this is great if you have a strategy

1069
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,360
of purchasing savings plans incrementally.

1070
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,330
Again, we hope before you
leave for the conference,

1071
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,710
you can engage your FinOps team

1072
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,240
or go in the console

1073
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,130
and think about making
a purchase right away.

1074
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,410
It doesn't need to be the
full recommended amount,

1075
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,290
but you can start saving with
the highest discount amounts

1076
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,360
on your like serverless

1077
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,350
and other high discount savings services

1078
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,560
pretty quickly by just
making a smaller purchase.

1079
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,060
Leaving a little bit of that on-demand

1080
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,370
for additional future analysis

1081
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,480
optimization programs or campaigns

1082
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,620
just still leaves you that flexibility

1083
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,340
to make some more optimization
and FinOps decisions later.

1084
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,560
So you can make these
smaller purchases like this

1085
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,750
and use purchase analyzer to make sure

1086
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,150
you're still netting some good savings.

1087
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,030
In this case, because we
purchased a lesser amount,

1088
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,370
we're still getting most of the savings.

1089
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,620
We're still getting $3,200 of the savings

1090
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,360
even though the commitment we made

1091
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,130
is quite a bit less.

1092
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,100
So again, you still yield a
very high amount of savings

1093
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,600
when you buy smaller savings plans

1094
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,900
'cause it consumes the
highest discount first.

1095
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,620
So once you do these analysis

1096
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,050
and you have different
look back periods...

1097
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,260
I'm actually gonna switch to a seven day.

1098
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,640
And we're gonna look at,

1099
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,140
say the last seven days

1100
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,210
is more representative
of what I want to do.

1101
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,680
And I want to see how much the system

1102
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,700
recommends me purchase

1103
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,150
based on the last seven days.

1104
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,070
One you make these decisions,

1105
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,050
you can quickly come in here,

1106
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,430
refresh the recommendation,

1107
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,420
get the latest data from
the most fresh usage,

1108
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,630
and then you can click this
add up cart button right here

1109
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,860
and make your purchase.

1110
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,270
In this case, we're
recommending a $22 purchase

1111
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,460
for $2,400 a month in savings,

1112
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,020
and you can quickly just add to cart

1113
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,400
and make your purchase.

1114
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,353
Once the purchase is complete,

1115
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,370
and you'd like to actually....

1116
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,203
Sorry.

1117
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:50,040
Another question, Adam, was,

1118
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,090
what if I made a mistake?

1119
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,920
What if I over purchased?

1120
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,800
What if, like, I'm afraid
of making the purchase

1121
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,080
because what if I find out
we were doing a migration

1122
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,480
and I wasn't aware of it,
or something like that?

1123
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,480
You have seven days to
return a savings plan

1124
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,510
as long as it's within the same month.

1125
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,610
So I recommend, generally,

1126
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,070
if you're not a hundred percent
positive on your purchase

1127
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,750
to not purchase at the end of the month,

1128
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,010
'cause once the month rolls over,

1129
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,270
we close the bill.

1130
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,890
But you have a seven day window

1131
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,270
to return any savings plan

1132
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,550
under a hundred dollars an hour.

1133
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,680
So this is a really nice feature.

1134
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,720
It protects you from any mistakes,

1135
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,340
fat fingers, or anything like that,

1136
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,320
if you accidentally added
another zero in the purchase,

1137
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,580
things like that.

1138
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,500
So this seven-day return button

1139
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,630
is something we launched
a couple years ago,

1140
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,540
and this just helps
increase the confidence

1141
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,300
that it's okay if you
fat finger something.

1142
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,640
You're not gonna go
half to engage support,

1143
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,620
you can just return that savings plan.

1144
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,290
And even if you make the purchase

1145
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,120
and begin to track
coverage and utilization

1146
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,530
and it's not looking right,

1147
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,360
your coverage is way too high

1148
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,280
or your utilization is way too low,

1149
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,390
you can return that savings plan

1150
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,250
and purchase a different amount.

1151
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,220
Okay, so moving on to coverage
and utilization report.

1152
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,260
Say we've made the purchase,

1153
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,050
then I can come in here
and look at coverage,

1154
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,340
and this will show you

1155
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,040
what percentage of your on-demand spend

1156
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,020
is covered by the purchases you've made.

1157
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,190
Now my coverage is really low

1158
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,990
'cause I made a purchase

1159
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,610
and then I returned it

1160
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,170
because I wanted to have

1161
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,750
nice big recommendations for the demo.

1162
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,090
So my coverage is pretty low,

1163
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,740
but you can come in here and track

1164
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,210
how much of your spend is being covered

1165
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,280
by commitments and discounts.

1166
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,580
And then you can also look at

1167
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,270
what resources are
consuming what commitments.

1168
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,980
In this case, I've got
a bunch of compute spend

1169
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,813
here and everything,

1170
00:46:38,813 --> 00:46:41,760
but you'll see these line items
for these different services

1171
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,800
and which services are consuming

1172
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,320
which amount of your savings plan spend.

1173
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,560
So you can filter and click
through different service types

1174
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,600
to understand which ones
are contributing the most

1175
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,400
to the savings you're achieving
from your savings plans.

1176
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,650
Alternatively, we have
the utilization report

1177
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,210
which will show you what percentage

1178
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,610
of your savings plans are being consumed,

1179
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,460
like we showed earlier in the slides.

1180
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,363
So that's it for our demo.

1181
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,150
I'm gonna switch back to the PowerPoint,

1182
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,610
invite Adam back up on stage here.

1183
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,078
- Let's give Rick a round
of applause if we could.

1184
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:20,320
(audience applauding)

1185
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,370
He covered a lot of ground with that.

1186
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,630
Really well done.

1187
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,480
I think these technologies

1188
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,220
that are in place in the billing console

1189
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,080
are incredibly helpful.

1190
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,330
And hopefully you saw something new,

1191
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,970
at least the icon for
Database Savings Plan.

1192
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,160
If you haven't seen that before,

1193
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,490
or you haven't seen that before,

1194
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,050
'cause it went live yesterday.

1195
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,850
As we close this presentation...

1196
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,130
And we'll be around
following the presentation.

1197
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,120
If there's any questions,

1198
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,770
feel free to come on up.

1199
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,680
But our recommendation and call to action

1200
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,080
is definitely to access it.

1201
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,310
As Rick just covered,

1202
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:54,600
no mistakes, right?

1203
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,540
You can do that return within seven days.

1204
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,790
But identify it, share it with your teams,

1205
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,990
access it, try it,

1206
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,060
see what the recommendations are doing.

1207
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,830
Isolate that custom range

1208
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,140
where you know you have
something interesting going on

1209
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,040
in your environment

1210
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,610
and see what the
recommendation comes back with.

1211
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,710
So that's access it, try it,

1212
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,330
we think is incredibly important.

1213
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,520
And as always, we want your feedback,

1214
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,980
we want your feedback from this session,

1215
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,450
which you probably have on your phones

1216
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,130
to fill out a quick survey,

1217
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,540
but we also have some websites.

1218
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,600
And I know Rick and myself
will make ourselves available

1219
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,550
to answer any questions
that you might have.

1220
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,230
But send feedback.

1221
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,695
You know, we'd love to hear
how this is working for you

1222
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,045
'cause it is a really
important launch for us

1223
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:37,427
that some people in the room

1224
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:40,560
have been waiting for nine years,

1225
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,580
I think, by those hands.

1226
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,050
So thank you for attending.

1227
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,520
It was great doing this with you, Rick.

1228
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,540
Appreciate it.

1229
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,150
And enjoy the rest of your re:Invent.

1230
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,703
- Thanks, everyone.
- Thank you.
