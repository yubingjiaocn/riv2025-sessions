1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,939
My name is Martin Schutz. I'm a principal

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,198
research scientist

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,658
and the global lead for the Amazon Advanced

4
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:07,559
Solutions Lab,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,179
and it is my great pleasure to be here

6
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,659
today with Romina Jalowettzky,

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,759
vice president and

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,420
research lead at JPMorgan Chase. So Romina

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:17,949
and I,

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,638
we want to take you on a little journey today

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,478
and show you how JPMorgan Chase

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,158
and AWS have collaborated together

13
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:28,158
on quantum R&D.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,000
In our larger effort to advance

15
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,759
quantum research together.

16
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,389
Now if you've joined the session today, some of the

17
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,868
questions you may have is

18
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,009
what is quantum computing?

19
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,429
Short but profound.

20
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:45,509
What does quantum R&D look like

21
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,168
today in 2025?

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,298
And what are some of the use cases

23
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:52,579
in industry that we are exploring together?

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,969
So these are some of the questions that Romina and I

25
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,020
will try to answer with the following

26
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,719
agenda.

27
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,840
We're going to kick us off

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,459
with a broad overview of quantum

29
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,620
computing and how we embrace this

30
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,638
emerging technology at AWS.

31
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,379
We're gonna then double click on our

32
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,500
collaboration with JPMorgan Chase.

33
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,299
We're going to discuss some of the challenges

34
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,138
we faced,

35
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,159
some of the lessons learned.

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,930
And then describe the

37
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,409
solution that we came up with,

38
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,388
a hybrid quantum classical algorithm

39
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,010
that we tested with more than 200 cubits

40
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,028
on Amazon bracket.

41
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,918
We will share with you some of the research results

42
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:34,219
that we achieved together

43
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,778
and then we're going to conclude with a quick summary

44
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,099
and an outlook for

45
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,659
future research and next steps.

46
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,870
OK, so let's get started with the elephant

47
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,269
in the room. What is quantum

48
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:47,939
computing?

49
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,930
And maybe let's first say what it is not

50
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,769
so quantum computers are not

51
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,189
a classical computer that just runs

52
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:56,838
faster,

53
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,519
but really a new paradigm, a new

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,448
frontier

55
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,028
for computation that leverages

56
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:05,719
the somewhat intricate and bizarre

57
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,750
laws of quantum mechanics

58
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,610
to perform computations in

59
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,849
novel and improved ways.

60
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:15,389
So these quantum mechanical predictions, they might

61
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,929
seem bizarre to us because

62
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,389
we live in a macroscopic world,

63
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,889
but if you consider the microscopic world

64
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:24,028
of single electrons, single atoms,

65
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,118
single photons,

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,490
these quantum mechanical laws and predictions

67
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,659
have been tested and verified

68
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,729
again and again over the last few decades.

69
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,558
Boosting our confidence in this theory

70
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:37,038
up to the point that we are now ready to build

71
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:39,319
machines that exploit these fundamental

72
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,379
quantum mechanical

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,969
laws. And that

74
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:43,629
originally

75
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,429
Dates back to the early 80s

76
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,210
where Nobel Prize laureate

77
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:49,729
Richard Feynman

78
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:52,758
said Nature isn't classical,

79
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:53,740
damn it,

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,149
and if you want to make a simulation of nature,

81
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:57,860
you better make it quantum mechanical.

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,719
And bygoli, it's a wonderful problem

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,080
because it doesn't look so easy.

84
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,409
So what Feynman recognized

85
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:07,219
early on is that

86
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,649
the cost of simulating a

87
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:10,770
quantum system

88
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,330
grows exponentially with its number

89
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,288
of particles.

90
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,909
So if you consider

91
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,189
already a small quantum system

92
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,729
with 50 to 100 particles

93
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:21,490
cubits.

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
And if you want to emulate the system on

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,538
a classical computer,

96
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,110
Your memory requirements

97
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,838
are going to balloon. They're going to go through the roof,

98
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,219
and even for already for these small systems with

99
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,679
just 100 particles,

100
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,389
you're going to talk orders of magnitudes

101
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,520
that are

102
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,169
on the level of the number of particles in the

103
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:41,758
universe.

104
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,719
So let's try to unpack this.

105
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:49,368
At a fundamental level, all our

106
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,550
information, our classical information

107
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:53,909
is stored in binary bits

108
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,929
that we typically label as 01. It

109
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:58,219
doesn't matter if you take your cell phone, your laptop,

110
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:59,588
or a supercomputer.

111
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,610
Now if you take two of these classical

112
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,080
bits at any point in time,

113
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,229
these two bits

114
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:10,250
can be in one of four configurations

115
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,389
00

116
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,349
or 01

117
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,229
or 10

118
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:16,730
or 11.

119
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,939
However, if you take

120
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,858
the quantum equivalent.

121
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,358
Two quantum mechanical bits or in short qubits.

122
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:26,079
They can be

123
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,660
in 00 and

124
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,178
01 and 10

125
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:32,178
and 11.

126
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,358
At the same time,

127
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,028
that's perfectly fine by quantum physics because

128
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,588
of the superposition principle.

129
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,838
More formally, how we write this down, we write

130
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:44,699
in general.

131
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,949
A quantum mechanical wave function labeled

132
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,069
here as psi just because we physicists

133
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,379
like Greek symbols.

134
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,189
But if you, so if you start with a general quantum

135
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,410
mechanical wave function,

136
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,290
let's start with

137
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,548
one single qubit.

138
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,449
If you want to describe one single qubit on

139
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:03,559
a classical computer, you're going to have to

140
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,548
define two numbers,

141
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:06,649
A and B.

142
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,470
If you go one step further,

143
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,329
if you want to define a general 2 qubit

144
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,449
state on a classical computer, you will have

145
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,519
to track, define, and track 2

146
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,369
to 24 numbers A,

147
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,809
B, C, and D, because

148
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:23,028
this wave function can form a superposition

149
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:24,910
and can live in the space

150
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,410
of these 4 computational states

151
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,259
at the same time.

152
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,759
If you take 3 cubits, it's 238

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,298
numbers.

154
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,949
If you take 50 cubits, it's 10 million

155
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,108
billion complex amplitudes that you

156
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,019
have to track,

157
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,449
and that nicely exemplifies

158
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,290
this exponential wall

159
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,939
that you will hit if you try to replicate

160
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:48,048
or emulate a small quantum system with

161
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,250
just 50 cubits on a classical computer.

162
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,519
So taking this one step further, we then as a

163
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,678
community realized that quantum

164
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:01,298
computers can actually also solve some problems

165
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:04,059
with exponentially fewer resources

166
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:05,600
than classical computers.

167
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,329
And that means that really what we are

168
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,480
shooting here for is not just

169
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,139
a 2

170
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,600
quote unquote just 2x

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
speed up as you might achieve with say

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,338
your next generation GPU,

173
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,660
but really

174
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,738
a fundamentally different

175
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:23,399
2x speed up that will

176
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,420
allow us to solve problems

177
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:27,838
that we could not solve otherwise because they're

178
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,879
intractable for classical computers.

179
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,139
So where do we anticipate

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,988
these kind of speed ups?

181
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:38,509
We've categorized and identified here

182
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,220
4 major categories.

183
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:42,670
On the left

184
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:45,178
there's physics and chemistry and material

185
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,389
science, and these are intuitively

186
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,369
relatively easy to understand

187
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,850
because here at the end of the day

188
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,410
you have to solve inherently

189
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,170
quantum mechanical problems.

190
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,730
Take for example truck discovery.

191
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,088
You want to solve for the ground state

192
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,639
of a large molecule.

193
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,399
That's inherently a quantum mechanical

194
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,759
problem, and you will have to solve Schrodinger's equation.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,439
There's arguably no better machine suited

196
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,970
to

197
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,379
complete this test than a quantum computer itself.

198
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,309
Material science

199
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,028
take our quest

200
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:19,108
to

201
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,928
build high temperature superconductors.

202
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,389
You will have to simulate

203
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,269
and understand the behavior

204
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:29,389
of many strongly correlated electrons.

205
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,449
Again, that's inherently a quantum mechanical

206
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,048
problem

207
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,129
that you better solve with a quantum machine.

208
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,000
Now What is maybe

209
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,028
even more striking is that later we

210
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,439
realized that quantum computers could actually

211
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,660
also solve

212
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,278
classical problems efficiently. And one of

213
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:49,809
the most famous examples is in cryptography,

214
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,199
where then in the 90s Peter Schor with

215
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,778
the Schor algorithm showed us

216
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,778
that you could actually crack.

217
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,139
In

218
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,559
classical encryption schemes such as

219
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,500
RSA,

220
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,160
the security of which rests on

221
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,220
the hardness

222
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,278
of factoring large numbers.

223
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,639
Something that cannot be done with classical

224
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,759
computers, even supercomputers, but where

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,040
showed us that this is

226
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,199
an easy task for a quantum computer.

227
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,730
Now taking this even one step further, we

228
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,889
then opened the aperture towards other

229
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,028
classical domains,

230
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,449
in particular optimization and machine

231
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:25,988
learning,

232
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,730
where quantum computers hold the promise

233
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,250
to solve problems such as resource

234
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,109
allocation

235
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,408
or portfolio optimization, and portfolio

236
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:35,869
optimization will be actually

237
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,928
the example use case that

238
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,450
Romina will then discuss in the second part

239
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,408
of this presentation.

240
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,239
OK, so this was kind of a

241
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,538
broad overview into quantum

242
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:52,250
computing and some of its

243
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,808
application areas.

244
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,320
So what does quantum R&D then look like

245
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:57,349
today? So

246
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,440
for

247
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:01,678
people in the field, scientists like Romina

248
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:02,369
and me,

249
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,899
the North Star is to lay

250
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:05,879
the groundwork

251
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:08,259
for future production workloads

252
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:09,320
typically

253
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:11,899
through hybrid quantum classical

254
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:12,658
workflows.

255
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,489
Now to get there we typically work backwards

256
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,029
by first identifying target

257
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:18,928
use cases

258
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,570
that on the one hand

259
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,769
are computationally hard.

260
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,149
And are

261
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,080
interesting to your business.

262
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,149
Once we have identified such a use case,

263
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,859
we then research

264
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,359
new quantum algorithms and

265
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,500
we were going to benchmark them against

266
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,330
the state of the art classical algorithms.

267
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,879
With that, develop new IP and

268
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,960
push the boundaries in our effort

269
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,158
to ultimately lay the groundwork

270
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,519
for the quantum future.

271
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,129
Now another twist to this is

272
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,759
our effort in bringing

273
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,009
this technology

274
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,710
from a niche technology today towards

275
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,729
broad adoption in the future.

276
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:03,149
So how do we think we can go about this

277
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,808
and achieve that?

278
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,869
Well, so we think we have to first research quantum

279
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:08,609
devices.

280
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,308
We have to research and benchmark quantum

281
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,168
algorithms.

282
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:15,710
Once we then take quantum

283
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,750
algorithms and quantum devices together, we

284
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,908
can solve some first scientific

285
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:20,779
use cases,

286
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:23,469
but ultimately again, the North Star

287
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,469
is to solve industry relevant

288
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:27,219
problems with broad application

289
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:30,308
and in doing so in our

290
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:31,969
journey as a community,

291
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,609
we want to switch gears from

292
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:35,908
studying the hammer.

293
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:38,469
Towards using the hammer.

294
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,750
Now to help you

295
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,668
on this journey towards using this hammer.

296
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,609
We offer

297
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,288
a suite of tools and offerings. One of them

298
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:50,609
is Amazon Bracket,

299
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,149
our quantum computing service on

300
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,029
AWS, which provides one consistent

301
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,190
experience no matter what your workload might

302
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,469
look like. So this could be simple

303
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,649
experimentations. This could be.

304
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,955
Deep research all the

305
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,293
way to future

306
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,394
larger scales in the future all

307
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:11,514
through one consistent experience where we

308
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:12,413
provide access

309
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,195
to different quantum hardware providers,

310
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,575
third party quantum computers, as well

311
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,754
as our own quantum hardware in the fullness

312
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,820
of time. Now

313
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,899
if you access Amazon bracket

314
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,239
today, already today,

315
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,340
you will

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,418
find a broad portfolio of quantum

317
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:31,119
devices

318
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,519
that features.

319
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,548
Quantum computers based on trapped ions

320
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:38,109
from INQ and AQT.

321
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,639
Two superconducting devices

322
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,320
from Regetti and IQM,

323
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:46,109
all of them are accessible

324
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:48,428
and programmable through the standard quantum

325
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:49,428
circuit paradigm.

326
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,129
But we also offer access

327
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,509
to Qerra's Aquila device

328
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,149
which already today comes with 256

329
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:57,820
cubits,

330
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,570
and this one is programmed

331
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,229
through the paradigm of analog

332
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,190
Hamiltonian simulation

333
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,969
which is geared towards solving

334
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,830
optimization workloads.

335
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,080
Another offering how we

336
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,519
want to help you on your quantum journey

337
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,678
is the Amazon Advanced Solutions Lab.

338
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,759
That's a team of scientists that I lead.

339
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,320
We engage in deep

340
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,820
custom R&D engagements

341
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,460
that are tailored towards your unique business

342
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,139
challenges.

343
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,798
We typically follow a two-pronged approach.

344
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,379
On the one hand, we research and

345
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:34,960
develop

346
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,099
novel quantum algorithms.

347
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,619
And at the same time we deliver business

348
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,658
value today with state of the art

349
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,719
classical algorithms, often quantum

350
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:46,168
inspired or physics inspired algorithms

351
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:48,580
that adopt ideas and principles

352
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,700
from quantum mechanics but can run already

353
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,808
today on classical compute.

354
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,840
Through that

355
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,259
we develop

356
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,538
IP

357
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:59,219
and know-how and help you prepare

358
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,080
for the quantum future.

359
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,408
And I think the most important message and outcome

360
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:06,629
is with that we

361
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,590
provide. Actionable outcomes

362
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,330
without the hype.

363
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,739
Such that you can understand if and when

364
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,960
quantum will impact your business

365
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,678
and inform your business stakeholders

366
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,440
with

367
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,599
target use cases,

368
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,580
and I think one beautiful example is

369
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,820
the work that we did with JPMorgan

370
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,099
Chase and now Romina will show you

371
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:32,379
and walk you through our collaboration.

372
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,288
Thank you Martin.

373
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,599
Hello everyone, good afternoon.

374
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,379
Uh, my name is Romina Shaloetzki.

375
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,918
Uh, and it's my pleasure,

376
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:49,379
uh, being here today, uh, to

377
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,418
share with you all how at JPMorgan

378
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:51,950
Chase,

379
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,000
uh, we have been collaborating with AWS.

380
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,700
So we are the Global Technology applied

381
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,038
research team at JPMorgan Chase.

382
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:03,820
We conduct an applied

383
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
research focused on the frontier

384
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,899
technologies

385
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,580
to transform scientific findings

386
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,158
into business value.

387
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,869
To do this, we work on 4 areas.

388
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:17,710
We assess the impact of novel

389
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,769
technologies

390
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,090
on the firm and for our customers.

391
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,450
We perform research driven

392
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,840
by use cases

393
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,519
to enhance client experiences

394
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,229
and optimize business processes.

395
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,279
We offer competitive advantage

396
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,639
via research-driven solutions.

397
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,940
And we execute proof of concept

398
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,580
initiatives to validate and demonstrate

399
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,609
initiative.

400
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:48,158
Our initiatives are and innovative

401
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:48,719
solutions.

402
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
Finance is rich in computationally

403
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,940
hard problems in optimization.

404
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,320
Actually optimization is ubiquitous

405
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,558
in our industry.

406
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,340
We can find this type of problems

407
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,940
in different areas in the financial

408
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,259
industry, uh, just a few of them

409
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,340
are portfolio selection and optimization,

410
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,279
pricing and hedging of options,

411
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,139
risk management, and also

412
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:19,719
asset

413
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:21,719
and liability management.

414
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,038
So as you can see, optimization

415
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,649
er is all over the place

416
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:27,849
er in finance.

417
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,259
And just to give you an idea of

418
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,500
one of these problems that

419
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
can be a potential use case for

420
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,759
quantum computing,

421
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,298
er, this is a portfolio selection

422
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:42,048
problem. So

423
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,570
here we consider a universe of assets.

424
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,408
These assets can be stocks,

425
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,359
derivatives, different types of instruments.

426
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,690
And we also consider the correlation

427
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,928
between these assets

428
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,048
and the idea here is that we would like to find

429
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,558
the largest set of uncorrelated

430
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:01,330
assets.

431
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,969
One way of visualizing this

432
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,070
is by.

433
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:09,219
Putting each of these assets, let's say A,

434
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:11,389
B and C, and all of them,

435
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:12,519
they're in the graph,

436
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,058
so you can see each node represents

437
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,288
one of these assets.

438
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,119
Then we have the edges between them

439
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,460
which represent the correlation that

440
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,139
we have.

441
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,729
So for example in this case, A is

442
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,019
correlated with D,

443
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,700
but A is not correlated, for example

444
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,099
with the asset E.

445
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:33,548
And now we would like to find the largest

446
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,070
set of uncorrelated assets.

447
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,548
In this case, you can see them uh

448
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:39,590
color in purple,

449
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,989
so we will have A, C, and

450
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:43,989
G. And you can see that these

451
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:45,869
nodes are not connected with an edge.

452
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,029
By doing this, we can find the set

453
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,190
of uncorrelated assets and

454
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,609
this could be a very diversified

455
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,889
er strategy

456
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,190
for for then allocate

457
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,889
capital.

458
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,399
In principle, this problem we

459
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,979
can have 228 solutions,

460
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,318
so if you would like to try out all possible combinations.

461
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,108
So this is 11 problem.

462
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,219
And actually we have seen that this problem can

463
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:15,439
become very hard.

464
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,239
So let me try to explain a

465
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,317
little bit what we mean with heart and what is the

466
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,538
challenge that we see in optimization

467
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:23,417
in finance.

468
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,910
So for example here you can see the runtime

469
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,390
in the Y axis

470
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,049
and in the X axis the problem harness.

471
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,868
And what we see is that the run

472
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:36,130
time can scale exponentially

473
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,930
with how hard the problem is.

474
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,789
One notion of hardness is the size,

475
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,130
so let's say that we consider a universe

476
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,088
with 100 assets.

477
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,868
We will see that all the possible combinations

478
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,250
that we can have is 1030.

479
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,630
This is 10 followed by 30

480
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,469
zeros.

481
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,430
Now increase a little bit more our universe

482
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,449
and now let's say that we have 1000

483
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:02,118
assets.

484
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,348
Now we will have 10

485
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:07,368
to 301 possible combinations if we

486
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,449
would like to do the brute force and go

487
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:10,989
over each possible combination.

488
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,000
So now remember that this is 10 followed by

489
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,660
301 zeros.

490
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,078
So we can see in this example how

491
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,078
exponentially the run time

492
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:20,660
can increase.

493
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,150
So actually we are very interested in that

494
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,420
side where we identify problems

495
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,430
that are very hard for classical

496
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,029
computers

497
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,509
are actually those type of problems

498
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:34,410
that we can

499
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,750
try to find some potential use

500
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,789
cases for quantum.

501
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Actually this problem of portfolio

502
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,259
selection

503
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,019
can be framed as a more general

504
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,719
problem which is known as a maximum

505
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,578
independent set.

506
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,118
This is a problem that has been studied

507
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,670
widely in in the computer science

508
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:57,949
uh community

509
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,368
and the idea here is that we

510
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,608
are going to consider a graph of

511
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,430
this type

512
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:06,328
and we can do this more generally

513
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,410
instead of thinking about assets as each

514
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,568
node, we are just going to think

515
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:12,368
about nodes and edges.

516
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,598
And the idea here is to find the maximum

517
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:16,420
independent set.

518
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,880
This is the set of nodes that are not

519
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,539
correlating between each other

520
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,809
and this is the maximum size that we

521
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:23,420
can get.

522
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:27,348
This problem has applications

523
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,689
in different domains

524
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,939
such as map labeling,

525
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,400
network design,

526
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,930
vehicle routing,

527
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:36,670
and as we commented before, in quantitative

528
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,949
finance with a portfolio selection

529
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:39,489
problem.

530
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,390
So now let me comment a little bit on on

531
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,630
the situation in quantum computing

532
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,969
when we started our collaboration

533
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,368
with AWS.

534
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,380
So by the time there was an empirical

535
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,449
demonstration

536
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,068
of a quantum speed up, uh,

537
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:01,789
published in the journal Science

538
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,549
by Evarietal.

539
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,578
And the idea in the paper is

540
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:08,759
that the authors

541
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:11,479
showed an experiment, some experiments

542
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:14,400
with up to 289 cubits

543
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:17,118
for the maximum independent set problem,

544
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,519
which is a problem that we just discussed.

545
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:22,989
In the paper, they show some

546
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,549
quantum speed up

547
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,098
er in the form as you can see there uh

548
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:28,088
in the plot

549
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,689
where in terms of success rate,

550
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:33,140
which the larger the better, it means

551
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,229
that the algorithm can run

552
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:35,969
faster.

553
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,709
We see that with quantum we

554
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,170
get that curve that is over the classical.

555
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,588
So in purple we have the performance with

556
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:44,229
quantum.

557
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,719
In blue er with classical

558
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,459
and we can see this performance boost

559
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,838
that we can get with a quantum

560
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:54,469
computer. So

561
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,828
this was a very good motivation

562
00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:59,088
for a collaboration between JPMorgan Chase

563
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,930
and AWS at the time.

564
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,189
And also very much motivated by this problem

565
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:06,170
of the maximum independence set

566
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,750
that as we have seen uh the portfolio

567
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,868
selection problem can be framed in this

568
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:14,858
way. So

569
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,180
through our collaboration,

570
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,618
we have published 4 scholarly

571
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:19,289
papers.

572
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,799
There you can find the links for for

573
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,279
the archive version of them

574
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,640
and we have also released

575
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,400
the code that we developed for

576
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,920
these works and that also you can find

577
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,479
them in the papers.

578
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:36,509
And through our quantum R&D

579
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,588
journey, uh, we have managed

580
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,789
to develop a suite of tools

581
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,309
for solving large and hard

582
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,088
problems

583
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,338
on today's quantum computers.

584
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,180
it. Today,

585
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:53,430
together with Martin, we, we would like to focus

586
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,209
on the very last work

587
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,568
that that we we have published.

588
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,489
So let's take a look er into this

589
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,689
work. So here

590
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,848
we introduced a hybrid

591
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,568
algorithm.

592
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,910
That uses both classical and quantum

593
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,549
computers.

594
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,608
We call this algorithm Q redumi,

595
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,848
Q for quantum,

596
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,368
R for reduction,

597
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,170
and MIS for the maximum independent

598
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,868
set problem.

599
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,118
And as you can see there, we are going to

600
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:27,250
use both the classical and the quantum

601
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,588
computer because at the end of the day

602
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:31,660
we want to get the best out

603
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,828
of these two

604
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,969
computational paradigms.

605
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,838
And you can see we have the circle

606
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:40,459
there because this is a recursive algorithm

607
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,838
where we are going to call both the

608
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:44,578
classical and the quantum computer.

609
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:49,769
So let's take a look to what they are

610
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,759
going to do on the classical computer.

611
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,509
Here, the idea is to perform an

612
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:56,309
exact reduction.

613
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:02,130
So the idea is that we are going to try

614
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,828
to reduce the problem.

615
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,608
So we are going to start with a graph

616
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,059
as we discussed before, where each node can

617
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,259
represent an asset

618
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,699
and it is that we are going to reduce it.

619
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:14,459
And to do this,

620
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,848
we take into account a basic

621
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:19,250
property of the maximum independent

622
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,809
set, which is that any click

623
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,449
can host at most one selected

624
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,009
node. In

625
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,130
this case, the idea of a clique

626
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,588
is a group of notes

627
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:33,269
that they they are connected between each other.

628
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:34,750
So for example,

629
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,890
here you can see that 1011 and 12,

630
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:40,150
they are connected between each other.

631
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:42,910
So that's uh one example of a clique.

632
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,009
And also the idea is that we are going

633
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,289
to reduce the problem

634
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,769
by removing what we call exposed

635
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:52,890
corner nodes.

636
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,670
Those are the ones that you see there in blue.

637
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,250
So for example you can see that

638
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,328
the node 2 is connected with

639
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:02,608
33 is part of a click

640
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:04,848
with also 476,

641
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:05,709
and 5.

642
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,368
But you can see that node there looks like

643
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,650
exposed because it's not connected with

644
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,309
anything else.

645
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,949
So that's one example of exposed node

646
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,449
and also the idea is that we are going to do this

647
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:17,368
for the whole graph,

648
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,809
so we're going to identify these

649
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,719
exposed corner nodes.

650
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:26,279
Now we are going to play a sort of

651
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,818
game that we refer as the Pac-Man.

652
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,259
So the idea is that we are going to start going

653
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,318
over the graph and we are going to

654
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,559
start removing some of these nodes

655
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,598
using the Pac-Man.

656
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,199
So for example here we are going to start with

657
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:40,279
the node one,

658
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,779
as you can see here the node one is

659
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:43,818
isolated.

660
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,759
So trivially this node can be part

661
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,779
of our solution because it's not

662
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,578
connected with anything.

663
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,959
In other words, it's not correlated with

664
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,000
any other assets.

665
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,420
So we are going to keep it as part of our solution,

666
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:58,838
so we remove it.

667
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,239
Now we are going to take a look to the node

668
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,430
2 as we said that's an exposed

669
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,469
quarter node

670
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,969
we are going to keep it in our solution

671
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,209
but we're going also to remove 3

672
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,170
because remember that we don't want

673
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:14,989
two nodes that have an edge

674
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:17,068
together. So we remove it,

675
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,529
we come here, we do the same with

676
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:20,789
8 and 6,

677
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:21,828
it goes away.

678
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,059
We do the same now with 9 and

679
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,529
10. Here

680
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,608
again we take 11

681
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,269
and we also remove 12.

682
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,509
Now 13

683
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,068
again this node is isolated

684
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:38,289
so we're going to keep it for a solution.

685
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,729
And now we reach here a click,

686
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:43,088
and the idea here is that we can select

687
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,618
any of these 3 notes.

688
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,309
In this case we're going to select 4.

689
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,799
And you can see in this example

690
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,858
that by playing

691
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:53,699
with the Pac-Man,

692
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:56,039
we have managed to solve the problem.

693
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,459
So you can see now all these nodes that

694
00:25:58,459 --> 00:25:59,479
are in blue,

695
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,939
these are going to be part of our

696
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:02,519
solution.

697
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,400
You can see that they are not connected with an edge

698
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,959
and this is the largest set of

699
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,380
uncorrelated

700
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,380
assets.

701
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,880
In this case, we managed to do it 100%,

702
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:14,818
the reduction,

703
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,709
so you can see it's a very

704
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,269
powerful technique.

705
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,328
But in the most general case,

706
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,269
maybe if it's more complex a problem,

707
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,289
it's not going to be 100%.

708
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:30,670
We have performed

709
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,868
er many experiments

710
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,130
with different networks, different

711
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,479
graphs of this form,

712
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,088
er you can see them there.

713
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:41,969
These are some networks that are

714
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:44,088
used in social sciences.

715
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,180
Uh, and I would like to draw your attention

716
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,189
to the very last one, the PubMed.

717
00:26:50,598 --> 00:26:52,640
This is a network where each

718
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,289
node represents a publication,

719
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,039
and the edges between them are

720
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,400
the citations that these publications,

721
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:01,799
uh, have between them.

722
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,380
You can see that this network is

723
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,880
quite large. It has

724
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,660
around 19,000

725
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,259
nodes.

726
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,689
We applied this reduction, this

727
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:14,299
Pac-Man,

728
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,229
and we managed to get now a graph

729
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,689
uh that we call a kernel with

730
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:20,809
16 nodes.

731
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,900
And you can see that we managed to do this

732
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,118
in less than a second. So

733
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:29,500
this is around 600

734
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:30,509
milliseconds.

735
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:33,680
So you can see that this technique is is very

736
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,259
powerful.

737
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:38,949
So now let's see it in action for a

738
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,489
problem that is of our interest.

739
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:44,189
We are going to have a graph like this.

740
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,130
Remember that each of these nodes

741
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,108
can represent an asset in the market,

742
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,170
the edge is the correlation.

743
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,318
We take this graph,

744
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,078
we put it inside a classical computer,

745
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,618
and we are going to play with the Pac-Man this

746
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:59,259
reduction.

747
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,289
The Pacman starts going over

748
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,068
the graph,

749
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,309
is going to take some of these notes

750
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,439
and are going to be put in the basket

751
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,789
of selected notes

752
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:12,449
and it's also going to remove some

753
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,949
of them in blue and it's going to go

754
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:16,989
to the removed basket.

755
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:21,529
We do this all over the graph

756
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:24,108
and there is one point that the Pac-man

757
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:24,890
stops

758
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,719
and it cannot get inside.

759
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,719
So in this case, we managed to reduce

760
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,500
the problem.

761
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:33,170
By a 73%.

762
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,299
But now there is a point where there is

763
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,618
no more exposed corner notes

764
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,670
for the Pac-Man to continue

765
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,279
going in.

766
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,019
And this is what we call the kernel.

767
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,209
In other words, this is the hardest part

768
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,170
of the graph

769
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,789
where actually now this Pac-Man cannot

770
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,029
go in. And

771
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:58,689
now the question is, OK, we have managed to identify

772
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,848
the hardest part of this problem

773
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,769
now how can we solve it?

774
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,890
For this, we are going to use the quantum

775
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,118
computer. Intuitively

776
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:13,259
the idea is that instead of using

777
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:15,900
the whole graph and inputting

778
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,848
everything into the quantum hardware,

779
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,400
now we are going to focus on the hardest

780
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,799
part of this problem.

781
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:25,630
So let's see how we use a quantum

782
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,439
computer. The

783
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,779
idea that we leverage in this work

784
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,699
is that quantum computers

785
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:37,199
are probabilistic sampling

786
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:37,838
machines.

787
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,489
So let us show you what

788
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,059
does it mean.

789
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,618
So the idea is that we are going to take our kernel

790
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,729
that it looks like that,

791
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,160
we're going to put it inside a quantum

792
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,219
computer and now the question is

793
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,259
what do we get out of it?

794
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,719
Let's consider a graph that is smaller,

795
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,939
so maybe it's

796
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:02,420
uh it's easier to understand.

797
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,160
So the idea is that we are going to consider here

798
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,019
only those four notes.

799
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,900
And let's see what happens. We put it inside

800
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,239
the quantum computer

801
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,920
and let's see the output.

802
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,779
The idea is that we are going to execute

803
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,459
the quantum program a couple of times,

804
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,098
let's say 500 times.

805
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,358
This is what we typically refer as quantum

806
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:28,880
shots.

807
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:32,289
Every time that we run we measure

808
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,368
and with that we construct that histogram

809
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:36,229
that you see there.

810
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:40,078
In the X axis we have

811
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:41,969
an identification of the node,

812
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,469
so you can see there 123

813
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,509
and 4. Each of them refers

814
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:47,150
to a node.

815
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,420
And what we're going to do, we are going to

816
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,618
report how many times we see these

817
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,219
notes

818
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:55,380
appearing in our solutions.

819
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:58,529
So for example, here, let's say

820
00:30:58,529 --> 00:30:59,818
that the node one

821
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,130
appears only 10 times.

822
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,519
So out of the 500 times

823
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,479
that we measure,

824
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:08,039
we only see that the node one appears

825
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,459
only in 10 of them.

826
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,630
In contrast, the note 3

827
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,170
appears in 490 times.

828
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
So the idea here is that if we see

829
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
the node 3 appearing so

830
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,250
much across our measurements,

831
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,039
it seems like it has high likelihood

832
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:28,420
for the selection.

833
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,430
So the idea is that we are going to

834
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:34,180
to keep this node as part of our

835
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,368
solution. In this

836
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:38,769
idea that we want to identify assets

837
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:40,809
that are uncorrelated, this could

838
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,930
be a potential asset that we would like to

839
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,108
have in our solution.

840
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:50,529
So now let's put together all the

841
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,608
different er ingredients that we

842
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:53,150
discussed.

843
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,380
So the idea is that we start with a graph.

844
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:59,650
We have our baskets empty, the ones

845
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,170
that we're going to put the notes to select

846
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,709
and the ones to remove.

847
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,618
er here we may consider a market

848
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:07,229
graph.

849
00:32:08,348 --> 00:32:10,410
Now we apply a reduction

850
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,390
this Pac-Man.

851
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,348
We start putting some of the notes in

852
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:16,559
their respective baskets and we reach

853
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,559
the kernel, that great part that you

854
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,578
see there. Now we take

855
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:23,039
the kernel, we put it into the quantum

856
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,979
computer and in this case we identified

857
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,539
the pink node, the dark pink node

858
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:31,660
as one of being with high likelihood

859
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:33,578
of being part of our solution.

860
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,118
So we put it in the baskets of selected

861
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:38,299
and we remove it together with the neighbors

862
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,939
in the light pink.

863
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,118
Because we don't want to keep notes that that are

864
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:43,739
connected.

865
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,828
Then we go back to a classical computer

866
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:47,989
and we try again.

867
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,709
Can now the Pac-Man solve the problem

868
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:51,890
to optimality?

869
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,209
And in this case, yes, it managed to

870
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,279
do it. So in this case

871
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,880
we managed to solve the problem.

872
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,368
And the idea is the following

873
00:33:01,989 --> 00:33:03,170
classical reduction

874
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:05,209
together with a quantum computer

875
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,049
as a sampling machine

876
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,390
is a powerful technique to solve

877
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,608
the MIS problem

878
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:13,108
and one example of this problem is a

879
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:14,709
portfolio selection.

880
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:24,098
So now we would like to share with you some of

881
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,140
the results.

882
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,199
So as you have seen, this

883
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,519
is the algorithm

884
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,959
and we have performed uh

885
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,039
some experiments using a

886
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,140
real quantum hardware

887
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,858
er of course here with the.

888
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,680
With our algorithm, we utilize

889
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,838
both the classical and the quantum

890
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:46,608
computer. For

891
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,328
our experiments we leverage the Aquila

892
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,598
machine which is available by

893
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:52,299
QEra

894
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,469
and we access it through

895
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,660
Amazon bracket.

896
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:00,930
And the idea here in this graph is that

897
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,289
we are going to compare our algorithm

898
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:04,729
Qreumis

899
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,130
uh which is uh uh in blue.

900
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,780
We are going to compare it with quantum annealing.

901
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,099
So quantum annealing is a

902
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,360
standard algorithm that that we can run

903
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,128
on this type of devices.

904
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:21,398
Uh, era,

905
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:23,909
uh, is a device that is, well,

906
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,869
a cuera's Aquila device,

907
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,090
er, is based on river atoms.

908
00:34:29,728 --> 00:34:32,088
So with this type of architecture, we

909
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:34,367
can run the quantum annealing

910
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,088
algorithm.

911
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,659
And the idea here is that we are going to use

912
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,458
our framework, the QRomis algorithm,

913
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,938
and we are going to power it with

914
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:44,898
quantum annealing.

915
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:48,208
So here we compare the two

916
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,268
results, the two, the two algorithms.

917
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,519
In the X axis we have

918
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,889
the problem hardness

919
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,780
as we commented before,

920
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
one notion of hardness could be the size

921
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,978
of a problem.

922
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:02,559
Let's say in this example of portfolio

923
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,599
selection could be how many

924
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,500
assets we have in our universe,

925
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,079
but also there are some other metrics that we

926
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:09,938
can use

927
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,438
to ident to understand how hard is a

928
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:15,280
problem. And

929
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,559
in the Y axis we have the success

930
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,139
probability.

931
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,889
The success probability,

932
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,409
as we said before,

933
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,280
the larger the better.

934
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,869
This is a number between 0 and 1,

935
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:29,188
so the closer to 1, the better.

936
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,750
It means that the algorithm is going

937
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,489
to run

938
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,369
faster.

939
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,648
So here we can see in red

940
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:39,829
quantum annealing. This is the standard

941
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:40,969
quantum algorithm.

942
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:44,030
And we see that if the problem is not

943
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,148
that hard at the very beginning of of

944
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:46,780
the plot,

945
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,389
we see that in some cases we

946
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,070
get a quite good

947
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,329
success probability.

948
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:55,878
But as this problem becomes harder

949
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:56,639
and harder,

950
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:59,039
we start to see that exponential

951
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,800
decay. It's

952
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
such that at one point at the

953
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,119
very end, you can see that the

954
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,059
success probability is 0.

955
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:12,418
That means that now we cannot

956
00:36:12,418 --> 00:36:14,070
get the optimal solution.

957
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,699
We may be able to get a close

958
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:18,070
to optimal solution,

959
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:20,648
but actually the probability of measuring

960
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:22,878
the optimal solution for a problem

961
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,340
is zero.

962
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,719
In contrast, you can see in blue

963
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,099
the performance of cute redomness.

964
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,590
This performance is very much concentrated

965
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,688
around one

966
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,188
you can see that for different problem

967
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:41,750
harness is very much concentrated

968
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,628
there er in one.

969
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,860
At the very end of the graph,

970
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:48,829
now that we are considering

971
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:51,349
problems that are harder and harder,

972
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:53,510
we see a small decay,

973
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,208
but overall the performance of

974
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,208
the algorithm

975
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,628
is over

976
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,449
89%.

977
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:08,148
So the main idea here is that we

978
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:08,969
managed

979
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,789
to get a performance boost in

980
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:13,789
comparison to quantum annealing.

981
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,869
Um, as we said, we have run

982
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,188
this on the real, uh,

983
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,809
hardware, on the real quantum device,

984
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:24,289
uh, through, uh, Amazon bracket.

985
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,239
Uh, and we have managed to go to a very

986
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,320
large size and also you can see

987
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,559
that we can see a different values

988
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,820
of problem harness.

989
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:34,409
Um

990
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,539
So yes, so here we managed

991
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,938
to to overcome this suppression

992
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:43,539
that that as we said is very limiting

993
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:45,599
because at some point we're not going

994
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,438
to be able to get the optimal

995
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,969
while with Q resumes uh

996
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:52,099
in most of the cases we managed

997
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,438
to get uh the optimal solution

998
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,398
with some

999
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,918
success probability.

1000
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,869
With that, er, I would like to, to hand

1001
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:06,938
in uh to Martin for the summary

1002
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:07,958
er and outlook.

1003
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:10,809
OK, uh,

1004
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,750
thank, thank you, thank you, Mina, for this, um.

1005
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,199
Nice,

1006
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,519
nice overview of our collaboration and

1007
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,978
some of the results that we

1008
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,639
achieved together, um.

1009
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:23,840
Over

1010
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,429
the course of two years culminating

1011
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,019
in

1012
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,559
4 publications and this hybrid

1013
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,500
classical algorithm that we refer to as

1014
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,429
Qanomus, so

1015
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,820
we try to take you on a journey. This has

1016
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,079
been our quantum R&D journey

1017
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:42,519
through this collaboration

1018
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:44,519
we have developed

1019
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,478
several methods. The key insight

1020
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:48,519
was that we

1021
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,969
um. Want to exploit some of

1022
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,398
the state of the art classical techniques

1023
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,809
where they are really the best at and

1024
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,739
exploit them as much as possible

1025
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,510
such that eventually

1026
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:02,079
we can have the quantum computer

1027
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,329
focus on what is really the hard

1028
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:06,449
core or the hard kernel of the problem.

1029
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,688
And for that we developed this

1030
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:11,829
hybrid quantum classical algorithm

1031
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,478
which is a general purpose solver

1032
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,958
for the maximum independent set problem, and

1033
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,110
we showed you how this can find

1034
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,349
applications, in particular

1035
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:23,510
in portfolio selection.

1036
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:26,079
In our paper we actually show how this can

1037
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,989
be part of a larger pipeline

1038
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,889
for portfolio optimization where you then

1039
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:32,389
distribute your budget

1040
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,989
across these diversified

1041
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:37,148
selected assets.

1042
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:39,239
Um

1043
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:41,809
The results that we achieved

1044
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,728
are in particular

1045
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,409
our experiments

1046
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,070
with over 200 qubits.

1047
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,708
They were all executed

1048
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,449
through the cloud on AWS

1049
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:53,878
on Amazon Bracket.

1050
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,898
And in the future we're looking to

1051
00:39:58,909 --> 00:39:59,539
test

1052
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:02,059
this algorithm on alternative

1053
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:03,168
hardware platforms.

1054
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,679
This algorithm, the concept per se,

1055
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,579
is actually hardware agnostic.

1056
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,500
Here we focused on a device

1057
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,110
based on Rudberg atoms,

1058
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,688
but you could essentially plug and

1059
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:16,188
play. And

1060
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,878
try your best, try your luck with say

1061
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:20,929
trapped ions or superconducting qubits

1062
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:21,909
and then really

1063
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,090
compare them head to head for

1064
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,228
one single pane

1065
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,769
of glass.

1066
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:30,369
Another step how we want to take this forward

1067
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,148
is obviously look for

1068
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:35,228
other applications besides portfolio

1069
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:37,349
selection because we think this is actually a pretty

1070
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,510
broad, powerful.

1071
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,429
Framework that combines the

1072
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,429
best of two worlds, the classical state of

1073
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:46,050
the art reduction algorithms,

1074
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:47,849
and the quantum samplers.

1075
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,168
And with that

1076
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,309
we'd like to thank you

1077
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,449
for listening. Thanks for coming,

1078
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:55,849
and a quick reminder,

1079
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,398
we please complete the session survey

1080
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:00,090
on the app. Thank you very much.
