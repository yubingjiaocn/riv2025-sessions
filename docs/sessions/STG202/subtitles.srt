1
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:06,579
(audience chatter)

2
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:08,306
- All right. Hi everyone.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:11,400
Welcome. Welcome to Vegas.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,723
Welcome to the session,
5:30. You guys must love us.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,143
All right.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,500
Today we're gonna take
you through this journey

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,290
of what's new with the Amazon EBS.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,660
We're gonna cover the
innovations we have done

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,390
in the past 12 to 18 months

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,870
and we're gonna have a little bit fun.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,670
So my name is Aaron Chen.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,740
I'm a product manager at Amazon EBS.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,925
Along with me is my
friend Sooraj Prasannan.

14
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:39,303
He's also a product manager at EBS.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,730
We invite him down the stage

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,100
and I'll walk you through
the first half of the journey

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
and then we'll swap.

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,340
Cool.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,774
So before we get started,

20
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:52,413
let's talk about EBS a little bit.

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,610
EBS stands for Elastic Block Store.

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,600
At its most basic,

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,720
it's a network attached persistent storage

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,420
to your EC2 instance.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,210
The storage is connected
to your virtual machines

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,410
over the network,

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,800
so it's disaggregated
from your EC2 instance

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,020
in terms of the data lifecycle.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,260
You're able to stop and
restart your instance.

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,180
You're able to reboot your instance,

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,243
your volume and your data
is still gonna be there.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,060
That's why we're able to offer
the different volume types

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,163
because it's attached over the network.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,820
You have your IO2 for
mission critical workloads.

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,283
You have your GP3 for
general purpose workloads.

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,470
EBS also provides the capability
of backing up your data

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,330
by snapshotting.

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,970
Snapshots is backed by Amazon S3

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,010
to provide high durability.

40
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,540
So in case of an issue,

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,630
you are able to start from your snapshot

42
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,153
and go back to your
production environment.

43
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,660
And the last part, between volumes

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,010
or between volumes and
snapshots, you wanna move data.

45
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,740
This can help you with
the different workloads

46
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,633
such as instant boot,

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,700
test and dev environment
creation or disaster recovery.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,560
That's what we call data service.

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,203
So EBS consist of those three pillars.

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,380
One thing it's very important to know

51
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,460
is that EBS is not just
a provisioned disk,

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,370
it's just not only offering
the block storage volume,

53
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,720
but behind the scene it's
actually a vast distributed system

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,190
and it's maintained and
operated by our EBS engineers.

55
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,200
So it's with that kind of system,

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,530
we are able to offer you
different level of performance,

57
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,633
durability, and different features.

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,020
So in terms of workload,

59
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,470
EBS is a storage that
serves a variety of workload

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,770
all the way varies from a most
submission critical workloads

61
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,770
that's powering your ERP and
the CRM to all the boot volumes

62
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,240
that booting your EC2 instance
or to the indexing layer

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,890
and the caching for your
analytical reporting environments.

64
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,340
If you have ever spin up a EC2 instance

65
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,330
or ever run anything
on Amazon Web Service,

66
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,227
chance are you have used EBS.

67
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,770
So like all the Amazon services,

68
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,630
all the innovation we do

69
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,040
are deeply rooted in the
customer needs and use cases.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,960
EBS is no exception.

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,530
So today we are looking
at the EBS innovations

72
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,680
through the lens of a customer.

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Let's use this rapidly growing
FinTech company as a example.

74
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,600
They have their core business
as a operation database

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,423
for their real time
transactional processing.

76
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,530
They also have a analytical warehouse

77
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,570
so they can use that to understand

78
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,580
what's happening with their business

79
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,880
with daily and weekly
reports, generating insights,

80
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,550
trying to analyze their
business, et cetera.

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,013
Lastly, to provide the new features

82
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:12,240
and the new experience to their customers,

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,580
they need to build and test

84
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,710
and that's why they have
a developer environment.

85
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,026
So they're able to continually
bring more innovations

86
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:23,040
to their customers in a
more controlled environment.

87
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,410
So we're going to talk
about our innovations

88
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,093
in these three aspects.

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's start with the
transactional processing systems.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,260
So these are your most
mission critical applications

91
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,650
handling their incoming customer traffic.

92
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,570
For our FinTech customer here,

93
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,990
their customer experience
is directly correlated

94
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,140
to the performance that
underlying the system,

95
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,993
which is why their business is critical.

96
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,850
These applications

97
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,850
are typically backed by
relational databases,

98
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,290
and those relational databases

99
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,200
run on EC2 as your compute layer.

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,653
While the EBS as the
persistent storage layer,

101
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,500
these relational databases

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,643
yearly require a consistent
sub millisecond latency.

103
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,592
This is because that the application

104
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:18,510
will trigger multiple combined I/Os

105
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,830
and when they come together,

106
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,850
the storage requirement is
taking multiple transactions

107
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,803
or millions of transactions.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,810
In addition, because they
wanted to rapidly grow

109
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,940
and expand globally,

110
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,320
they'll need the infrastructure
level parity worldwide,

111
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,680
that they can simplify
their infrastructure.

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
They're able to run their applications

113
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,160
without any modifications

114
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
with the same architecture everywhere.

115
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,623
It takes a lot of
operation burden off them.

116
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,490
Lastly, because of this system
is very mission critical.

117
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,141
The customer needs to constantly ensure

118
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,920
that their system is of high resiliency.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,980
As a result, they need observability

120
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,320
to understand the
performance of their systems

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,330
if it's meeting their expectation

122
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,520
and they need to continue to test

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,580
if the system's resiliency is good enough

124
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,500
and if the failover mechanism

125
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,073
will operate as expected to
maintain the high availability.

126
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,880
So let's unpack all three, each of them.

127
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,980
Let's start with the performance metric,

128
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,100
which is the millions of transactions

129
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,893
or consistent sub millisecond latency.

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
So to deliver the desired experience

131
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,450
where a customer don't experience a lag

132
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,130
when they run something,

133
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,970
these applications require
to have a storage layer

134
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,550
that is a very low latency.

135
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,070
Imagine you are clicking a button,

136
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,950
you're submitting a form,
you are making a purchase.

137
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,450
These things yearly will
trigger a ton of correlated I/Os

138
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,970
that's either read or write

139
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,030
and all of us would hate
the spinning circles

140
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,013
and waiting for something to process.

141
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,420
So to ensure the customer
getting the instant response

142
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,150
on these things, each of the storage I/O

143
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,233
needs to have a very low
latency, ideally sub millisecond.

144
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,420
And to ensure that experience
is actually very consistent,

145
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,470
your storage layer

146
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,230
needs to deliver a sub millisecond latency

147
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,593
or very low latency in a
very consistent manner.

148
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,160
If you don't, they might lead to lag

149
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,430
or even the application unavailability

150
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,780
and then it could lead to loss
of sales or loss of revenue.

151
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,453
So there's also real monetary impact.

152
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,290
So that's why at EBS we recommend you

153
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,170
to run the very critical
workload on IO2 volume

154
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,400
IO2 volume provides the best
lowest P 99.9 I/O latency

155
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,963
among the major cloud providers,

156
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:03,300
and we further tightened
our latency guidance

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,632
from the sub millisecond average latency

158
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:08,613
to sub 500 microseconds.

159
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,660
Beyond that, we also added clarity

160
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,470
to how our IO2 outlier
latency differentiate

161
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,770
from our general purpose volumes.

162
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,530
So now customers able to
understand the difference

163
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,203
and making the right price
performance trade off.

164
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,070
So we cover the performance.

165
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,480
The next pillar is the
global infrastructure parity.

166
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,860
So as our FinTechs company grow
more into different places,

167
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,390
you also wanted to develop
in those new regions

168
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,120
that are different in the worldwide.

169
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,670
So you want the same
infrastructure available

170
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,920
across the regions.

171
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,780
It will reduce the operation burdens

172
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,320
and will bring the data closer
to you to their customers,

173
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,200
in this case so they can
achieve lower latency

174
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,260
and offer the same experience everywhere.

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,220
As a result, we expanded
IO2 block express volume

176
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,520
to all commercial and the GovCloud regions

177
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,140
meeting the customer needs.

178
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,360
So our FinTech company here

179
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,843
is able to serve their customer
in the same way everywhere.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
Now we talk about the performance,

181
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,260
we talk about global parity.

182
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,693
The next pillar is high resiliency.

183
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,010
For application to be high resiliency.

184
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,833
It starts with one thing
and that's measurement.

185
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,250
A lot of time that we
hear customer asking us

186
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,247
these questions like,

187
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,670
"I have a EC2 EBS environment,

188
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,957
how do I monitor the performance?"

189
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,447
"Do I have enough headroom?"

190
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,510
We just got a issue.

191
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,014
Is it a application issue
or a infrastructure issue?

192
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:51,480
And the AWS can help.

193
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,480
So with this, you actually
want to provide observability

194
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,780
and observability have helped customers

195
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,720
to understand their performance

196
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,183
and to understand where
things can go wrong.

197
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,290
So over the past couple of years,

198
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,910
EBS has been on a journey

199
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,650
to improve the visibility
into the volume performance.

200
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,110
In 2024, we launched a metric

201
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,200
that is average latency in call watch.

202
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,578
This provides customer

203
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:28,170
to be able to understand where
the performance bottleneck.

204
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,270
This year we launched IOPS

205
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,060
and the throughput metrics in CloudWatch

206
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,280
so that the customer can monitor

207
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,043
and track performance trend and optimize.

208
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,560
These are the regular metrics.

209
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,320
We also launched another set of metrics

210
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,450
called exceed checks.

211
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,870
So last year we launched the
volume level exceed checks,

212
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,990
and this year we launched the
instance level exceed checks.

213
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,800
These exceed checks are
the zeros or ones metric

214
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,620
that if your driven IOPS or throughput

215
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,370
reach beyond your systems
entitlement, it'll turn into one.

216
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,610
And you know that's where
your bottleneck is, right?

217
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,590
With those signals.

218
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,830
It tells you right away that
the performance degradation

219
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,180
is because of the
entitlement of your system

220
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,400
or something else, right?

221
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,400
So with that, if you are
bottleneck is on the volume side,

222
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,260
you are able to use elastic volume

223
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,490
to tune up the performance
and to release that.

224
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,713
Or you can modify the instance size.

225
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,267
So now customers say,

226
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:40,077
"I can measure the impact. What's next?"

227
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:43,170
"I can see the average latency,

228
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,410
but how do I know that at what time

229
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,170
my system will get disrupted?

230
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,640
And if my standard operating
process procedure will work?"

231
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,550
So introducing chaos testing, right?

232
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,770
It's not a unfamiliar concept

233
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,130
because it is necessary
today to build a resilient

234
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,690
and reliable system by
proactively providing tests

235
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,143
and finding those vulnerabilities
and then you can fix them.

236
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,870
So chaos testing

237
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,930
is something that you've done
in a controlled environment

238
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,140
because you don't really want
to do it on your production.

239
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,460
So when you do that,

240
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,460
you intentionally simulate a
failure in this environment.

241
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,640
So you can uncover the hidden
weakness or dependencies.

242
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,380
And once you realize that,

243
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,700
you can fine tune the process
to improve the recovery times

244
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,830
and to test your standing
operating procedures

245
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,700
to ensure the system fell over
to the other side correctly.

246
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,170
And that is very critical

247
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,383
for the modern complex
and distributed systems.

248
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,710
So AWS fault injection systems or FIS,

249
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,540
force injection service or FSS,

250
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,063
is the service just for that.

251
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
It is managed service

252
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,760
that enable you to run

253
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:05,163
these fault injection
experiment on your workloads.

254
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,890
If you think about EBS fault,

255
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,890
it manifests itself as a
slow I/O or stock I/O yearly.

256
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,490
And in 2023, we've launched
a EBS action in FIS

257
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,720
called stock I/O.

258
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,020
So you are able to test
if a volume was stuck

259
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,680
and monitor if the timeouts

260
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,740
and alarm functions are
working as expected.

261
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,130
Well, this year we are
introducing more tests

262
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,900
in your latency.

263
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,530
So you are now allowed to
inject latency to your system.

264
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,390
And so think of it

265
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,960
as your simulating a grade failure, right?

266
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,167
So we offer four different
type of templates.

267
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:52,090
So you can run the test such
as the sustained latency,

268
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,550
increase in latency or intermittent
latency as like a spike.

269
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,440
And then your decreasing latency.

270
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,990
Of course, you can also specify

271
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,270
and build your own custom template

272
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,346
by inputting the read and write mix

273
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,623
and introducing latency to read or write.

274
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,100
So with the performance
tested and observed

275
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,040
with the impact on mitigated

276
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,020
on understanding operating procedure,

277
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,200
the other part of the
protection to achieve resiliency

278
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,823
is to prevent data loss.

279
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,543
Customers sometimes delete volumes,

280
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,163
by accident or even malicious intent.

281
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,120
And that is very important

282
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,800
because those kind of disruptions

283
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,990
can result in financial loss

284
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,023
or sometimes even damage
to your reputation.

285
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,065
So having such a data
protection strategy is critical

286
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:54,000
and ensuring the data can be restored

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,933
in the timely manner after
incidents is very important.

288
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,190
We've launched recycle
bin for EBS snapshots

289
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,690
a couple of years back,

290
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,500
and now this year we have
extended that support

291
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,450
to EBS volumes.

292
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,160
To use recycle bin, you are
able to set a retention period.

293
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,380
So when you delete volume,

294
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,080
your volume goes right to the bin.

295
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,780
Within the retention time,

296
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,540
you are able to perform a recovery action.

297
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,730
So the volume goes back to production.

298
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,180
Those recovered volume
is immediately available

299
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,600
and you be able to attach
it to your EC2 instance

300
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,090
and resume your workloads.

301
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,240
The volume will retain all the tags,

302
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,770
all the encryption status

303
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,233
or permissions that you
specified for it before.

304
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,470
For the volumes are not recovered.

305
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,620
And the the retention period lapsed,

306
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,990
then they are deleted permanently

307
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,033
when the retention period expires.

308
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,348
So you can create these retention
rules by a single volume

309
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:02,043
or by group volume, just
use tags and to figure out,

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,877
okay, now coming back
to our FinTech customer,

311
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:09,827
- [Audience Member 1] Is that
like the snapshot protection?

312
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,697
- I can't hear you clearly, I'm sorry.

313
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:17,072
- [Audience Member 1] Is that
like the snapshot protection?

314
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:20,072
(audience chatter)

315
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:24,450
- Yeah, it's the same thing
as the way lock for snapshot.

316
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,777
So coming back to our
FinTech customer here,

317
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:30,900
we covered the first pillar,

318
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,510
which is the real time transaction system.

319
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,460
Now let's welcome Sooraj back to stage

320
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,610
to talk to you through
about the other two.

321
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:39,903
- Thanks Aaron.

322
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,737
So Aaron spoke about the real
time transactional systems,

323
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:48,300
which are extremely important
to run your business, right?

324
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,970
But if you think about the
analytical warehouse system,

325
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,387
that's where you get to figure out,

326
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,120
"Hey, what's happening with the business?"

327
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,088
Where is the business going
and what do you do about it?

328
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:58,470
So it's extremely important in a way.

329
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,580
I think about it as

330
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,380
you have so many different
stakeholders in the business,

331
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,870
it aligns everyone on a
single source of truth, right?

332
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,840
So that's why your analytical
warehouses are so important.

333
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,580
And if you think about
some of the questions

334
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,800
you would ask from an analytical systems,

335
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,300
if you think about financial data,

336
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,340
it would be, "How are my margins trending?

337
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,510
How is my revenue trending?"

338
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,870
If you're thinking about sales question,

339
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,693
you would be thinking about,

340
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:22,252
"How are my products selling

341
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:23,370
in each of the different regions?"

342
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,780
If you are thinking about marketing,

343
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,150
hey, you're running different
kind of campaigns, right?

344
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,650
And you want to know how is the conversion

345
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,880
for some of these campaigns?

346
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,280
And if something is going
great, how do you double down?

347
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,630
If you are doing product development,

348
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,717
you're trying to figure out,

349
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:36,897
"How are my customers using
my product currently?"

350
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:39,209
What is the sentiment?

351
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:41,160
What are the complaints you're hearing?

352
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,453
So you can drive that to drive
better product decisions.

353
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,957
And on the inventory side,
you're trying to figure out,

354
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:49,410
"Hey, do I have the inventory
to support my customer?"

355
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,970
So there are different kind of questions

356
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,430
you wanna ask from the
analytical warehouse system,

357
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,483
as you would imagine,

358
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:58,110
it has a bunch of data which
streams into these systems,

359
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,520
and then you have to run analytics

360
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,020
and querying on it to get the insights.

361
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,020
So it's a very resource intensive system.

362
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,050
And we'll get into what kind
of product storage requirement

363
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,820
it drives and what we have done in 2025

364
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,920
to make the analytical warehouse system

365
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,513
much better to run on EBS.

366
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,050
So as I said, you have all kinds of data

367
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,880
streaming into the
analytical warehouse systems

368
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,220
and typically the storage is S3, right?

369
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,922
So you have your OLTP
systems streaming data

370
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,850
through your change
tracking into the systems,

371
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,540
you have your sales data,
finance data, marketing data,

372
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,330
IoT data, like think about
all the kinds of data

373
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,190
which is streaming into S3.

374
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,440
And for that data, you would think

375
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,357
it's going to be in all different
kinds of formats, right?

376
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:44,190
So if you have to run a query,

377
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,260
you have to normalize it to some extent

378
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,610
so you can run queries on it.

379
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,430
So that's where one place
where EBS comes into play

380
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,490
when you have to do the ETL
jobs on these huge data sets,

381
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,510
which is inside in S3,

382
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,760
because you need a
faster processing layer.

383
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,440
The other place where EBS comes into play

384
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,270
is when you're running queries.

385
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,680
It could be your nightly queries,

386
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,430
it could be add out queries,

387
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,470
it could be a nightly reporting jobs.

388
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,660
Customers need a fast storage layer there

389
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,720
to kind of speed up those queries, right?

390
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,610
So the first requirement is,

391
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,310
data has to be extracted quickly from S3

392
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,613
into the EBS layer.

393
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,600
So you can run the ETL jobs
or you can run your queries.

394
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,870
The second requirement is, if
you think about these queries,

395
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,520
if you're thinking about
aggregates and joints,

396
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,570
there's a lot of data,

397
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,670
intermediate data which gets generated,

398
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,520
which you necessarily don't
want to persist in S3, right?

399
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,690
It's a throwaway data,

400
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,120
which you don't want to keep long term,

401
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,110
but you want it absolutely

402
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,900
during the time when the query is running.

403
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,240
Because if you lose that
data or if the volume fails,

404
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,000
then you'll have to rerun
the whole query again, right?

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,730
So it's important that
EBS has enough capacity

406
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,953
to manage that query layer.

407
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,310
And lastly, if you guys are aware

408
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,650
of how these data processing layers work,

409
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,140
typically there is a spark framework.

410
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,220
So they take a query job

411
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,600
and they split it into smaller jobs.

412
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,100
That's one way to think about it.

413
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,380
And then you make sure that these jobs,

414
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,460
they split it into smaller sections

415
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,570
so they can run in parallel.

416
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,640
And also it's better failure management.

417
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,990
So if a small job fails,

418
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,230
you have another job which
comes up, spins up in its place,

419
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,780
another EBS volume attaches
and it goes, right?

420
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,001
And customers typically use
containerized environments

421
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:17,670
for that kind of processing.

422
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,280
So now if you take a step back,

423
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,140
we need high throughput,
we need large capacity.

424
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,610
Now you can definitely get that

425
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,010
by combining raid, different
kind of EBS volumes.

426
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,390
That's one way to do it.

427
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,240
But the hard part is in
containers environments,

428
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,620
RAIDO is not natively supported.

429
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,480
I mean, RAIDO in general is cumbersome,

430
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,330
but in containers, if you're
dealing with a lot of systems,

431
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,330
it's gonna be extremely hard
to support rating of volumes.

432
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,577
So that drives the requirement that,

433
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:44,130
"Hey, from a single data volume,

434
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,100
I need very high throughput and
very large capacity," right?

435
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,821
So that's what motivated
us to deliver GP3 volumes

436
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:56,821
with larger performance and larger size,

437
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,270
it reduces the need for
you to RAIDO volumes

438
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,290
in the container environment.

439
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,240
So we increased IOPS by 5X,

440
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,121
we went from 16K to 80K throughput,

441
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:09,000
doubled it from 1GB to 2GB throughput.

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,060
And we also increase the
size from 16 terabyte

443
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,080
to 64 terabytes.

444
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,060
So for example improvement in size.

445
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,670
So Aaron also spoke about the OLTP system.

446
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,400
So this also helps in
your OLTP environment.

447
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,690
So typically what customers do

448
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,550
is they have a production environment

449
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,740
which might be running on IO2 BX volumes

450
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,360
for latency consistency.

451
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,950
But then your testable environments

452
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,000
don't need that kind of performance.

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,008
So they will be running on GP3,

454
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,930
but they need the same size, right?

455
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,899
So if you have a 64 terabyte IO2 BX volume

456
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,310
before this launch, you would
be striping four GP3 volumes

457
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,550
to get that same test environment.

458
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,159
And it's very cumbersome

459
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,250
if you're snapshotting that environment.

460
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,210
So now with this launch,

461
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,401
you can have a 64 terabyte IO2 volume

462
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,710
and a 64 terabyte GP3 volume.

463
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,900
So simplifies your test of workflows.

464
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,060
So improves developer agility.

465
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,941
So that was one of the
features we launched

466
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,093
for the analytical
workflows also helps OLTP.

467
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,790
Now as you know, EBS is
network attach storage.

468
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,470
Just having a very large volume

469
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,820
with a lot of performance

470
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,310
investing just there is not
going to solve the problem.

471
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,860
You also need to make sure
that the network pipe,

472
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,380
which comes from the
compute to the EBS fleet,

473
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,820
is big enough

474
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,010
that customers can drive
that throughput, right?

475
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,710
Drive that performance to the volume.

476
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,510
And this has been a journey for us

477
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,884
because bigger the pipe, the lower the TCO

478
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:28,770
to the cost of ownership
of an EBS solution,

479
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,359
customers who have very
large scale of workloads

480
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,180
also helps them land like even
larger and larger workloads

481
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,170
on top of us.

482
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,210
So we started with a hundred IOPS

483
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,060
sharing with EC2
networking back in the day

484
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,530
with Nitro enabled,

485
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,557
all the Nitro instances
have a dedicated EBS pipe

486
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:45,030
with much larger performance.

487
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,920
In 2019, 2020,

488
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,290
we realized that customers
need a separate SKU

489
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,350
with very high networking performance.

490
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,580
So we launched R5b, also R5in,

491
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,084
so R5b had three X higher performance

492
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:57,256
than the generic instances
at that point in time.

493
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,946
Then we launch R6in to follow that up

494
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,593
and this year we launched R8gb.

495
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:05,160
It has 150 Gbps of bandwidth.

496
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,860
So that's 18.75 gigabytes of throughput

497
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,240
from a single instance to
the EBS fleet and 720K IOPS.

498
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,090
So with that, if you have an OLTP system,

499
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,812
as Aaron mentioned, they
are very latency sensitive,

500
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,270
they're very tightly coupled systems

501
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,280
to deliver that latency
sensitivity, right?

502
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,110
So that delivers,

503
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,210
that requires scale up
kind of compute, right?

504
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,043
If you think about it.

505
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:26,730
So a lot of CPU, a lot of memory

506
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,766
and as a result a lot of
storage performance needed

507
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,540
from a single instance.

508
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,370
So helps with that for sure.

509
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,770
You can land like even
larger and larger workloads

510
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,800
on AWS and on EBS.

511
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,940
The second thing, as I said,

512
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,950
in the previous slide,

513
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,080
these query jobs get broken
down into smaller jobs.

514
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,970
So when you're running
these analytical jobs,

515
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,680
you're using smaller instances

516
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,510
and generally when you
are using instances,

517
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,170
you don't want your CP or
memory to be stranded, right?

518
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,300
That's the most expensive
part of an instance.

519
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,060
So by making the pipe bigger,

520
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,520
we ensure that that doesn't
become the bottleneck, right?

521
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,823
So you have better TCO of
running an EBS solution.

522
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,487
So that was for the analytical
workflows helps OLTP as well.

523
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:09,930
We use that as an example

524
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,990
because it's easier to explain
in the analytical framework.

525
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,030
Now, the next thing, and the
last one we wanna discuss

526
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,460
is the developer environment, right?

527
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,780
So if you think about a
developer environment,

528
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,490
the customer has a production environment

529
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,140
which is taking live traffic,

530
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,430
they want test dev environments
for development purposes,

531
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,650
but the requirements are
the production environment

532
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,880
should not be impacted

533
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,740
when you're creating a test environment.

534
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,970
You also want to make sure

535
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,445
that the data you are transferring
to the test environment

536
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:37,950
is not sensitive, right?

537
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,390
You don't want that data
to be widely shared.

538
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,760
So those are two requirements
on the production system

539
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,733
when you're trying to create
a copy of your volume.

540
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,360
And then the other workflow

541
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,420
and the other requirement
on the test environment is,

542
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,500
they want the data to mimic
production environment

543
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,340
so there's this push
and pull from both sides

544
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,740
because you want similar rich data.

545
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,210
So you can work on that,

546
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,160
you can similar real
world examples, right?

547
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,610
So if you're a person
managing infrastructure

548
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,043
for developers,

549
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:05,280
there are a couple of things
you want to think about.

550
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,900
You wanna ensure that the test environment

551
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,060
is as close to the product
environment as possible.

552
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,590
And if you have a
distributed development team,

553
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,840
you want everybody to work
off the same code base, right?

554
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,420
So those are the two things.

555
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,080
So think about our FinTech customer.

556
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,420
They have a real time transaction system,

557
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,770
live traffic, there's an issue.

558
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,960
They want the ability to create
a copy of that environment

559
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,162
as quickly as possible, debug
the issue, root cause issue,

560
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:27,270
fix the issue, and deploy the fix, right?

561
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,770
So we'll see how we made

562
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,590
that the ER experience simpler this year,

563
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,050
but with the features we have launched.

564
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,480
So the digging deeper into
both of those workflows.

565
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,730
So the first workflow is a copy workflow.

566
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,930
So you have a production environment,

567
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,910
which with EC2 instances,

568
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,800
with a bunch of EBS volumes attached,

569
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,240
you create your test environment.

570
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,030
Again, instances with a lot
of volumes attached, right?

571
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,140
So in the prod environment,

572
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,790
you don't want any kind of impact

573
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,440
when you're creating these copy workflows,

574
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,510
you don't want to copy
sensitive data as well.

575
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,310
So that's a requirement on the prod side,

576
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,300
on the test dev side,

577
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,660
you want to create more
frequent copies of the data

578
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,600
so it's as fresh to the production
environment as it can be.

579
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,120
So you want to be very close to that.

580
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,456
The other requirement is
on the production side,

581
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:11,310
you might have volumes, you
might use IO2 BX volumes, right?

582
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,860
And on the test dev side,
you might not need IO2 BX

583
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,540
because it's not very latency sensitive.

584
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,266
Doesn't make sense to have I02 BX there.

585
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,640
So you might want the ability
to mix and match volume types.

586
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,880
Your source could be IO2,
your destination could be GP3.

587
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,810
So those are the requirements
which that workflow drives.

588
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,540
And then if you think about
the second workflow, which is,

589
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,700
"Hey, I want all my developers,"

590
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,220
like this FinTech company
which we're talking about

591
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,810
is growing globally, right?

592
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,970
So they have developers
all around the globe,

593
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,803
they wanna make sure

594
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:42,030
everybody's working
off the same code base.

595
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,957
So in that case, what customers
do is they create a AMI,

596
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:46,721
which is Amazon Machine
Image, a golden AMI,

597
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,110
which basically underneath the covers

598
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,560
is creating snapshots, right?

599
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,279
AMI creates snapshots and
then they copy that snap,

600
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,440
copy the AMI across different regions

601
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,510
and copying the AMI
triggers copy snapshots

602
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,920
underneath the covers.

603
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,260
And then when you create
a dev environment,

604
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,450
you are launching an
instance from an AMI, right?

605
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,940
So again, that's a volume
getting created from a snapshot.

606
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,970
So you can see there are
multiple moving parts here.

607
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,500
Customer triggers these workflow,

608
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,820
sometimes daily, sometimes weekly

609
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,200
based on that development cycle.

610
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,330
So for both of these workflows,

611
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,130
they require predictability and speed

612
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,110
because if it's not predictable and fast,

613
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,640
it's very cumbersome to manage, right?

614
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,820
So that's what we heard
consistently from our customers.

615
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,580
So let's look at each what
we did in each one of them.

616
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,802
So we launched EBS
volume clones this year.

617
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:32,700
So previously customers,

618
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,530
when they had to create a volume clone,

619
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,020
they would use snapshot as
a intermediate layer, right?

620
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,390
You would create, in FinTech environment,

621
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,650
they would've I02 BX volumes,

622
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,050
they would create a snapshot
of those IO2 BX volumes,

623
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,477
which means pushing data
from the EBS volume,

624
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:48,750
the EBS fleet to EBS
snapshots, which is on S3.

625
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,850
Then you're creating a
volume from that snapshot,

626
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,350
which means again, pulling down data

627
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,062
from the snapshot down
to the EBS volume, right?

628
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:58,051
So it takes time to do that.

629
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,167
It's cumbersome to do that.

630
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:04,171
And then after the data is fully,

631
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:06,000
like after the volume
is fully initialized,

632
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,580
you would attach those volumes
to your test dev environment

633
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,840
and and your instances to
trigger the test of workflows.

634
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,215
With volume clones, what we have done

635
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,440
is we have taken the
snapshot out of the picture.

636
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,990
So now you copy data directly
from the EBS source volume

637
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:21,802
to the target volume.

638
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,050
It's a single API call, right?

639
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,300
And you can create a performance volume

640
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,983
with a single API call instantly.

641
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:32,520
You can start with an IO2 BX
volume on the left hand side,

642
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,380
create a GP3 volume on the right hand side

643
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,236
for your test of environment.

644
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,888
And we make sure that the prod
environment, the prod data,

645
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:42,450
prod volume does not get any
kind of performance impact.

646
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,115
So those were the requirements
from the previous slide.

647
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,080
So you have done that.

648
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,730
So as I said, the previous
workflow used to be,

649
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,180
say you are a developer
managing the previous workflow,

650
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,160
you have to know when the
snapshot was completed.

651
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,840
You have to know when the
volume is fully initialized.

652
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,990
That's very cumbersome.

653
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,130
With this we have improved
developer efficiency

654
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,510
and if you recall, the other requirement

655
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,340
was to create copies more frequently.

656
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,410
Now that copies doesn't take
a lot of time to create.

657
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,360
You can create more copies frequently

658
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,250
to keep your test dev environment

659
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,830
as close as possible to
the production environment,

660
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,900
which improves the quality
of your code, right?

661
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,543
So that's what we did.

662
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:18,256
Other than this workflow we
also see customers use cloning.

663
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,160
And this was an emergent use case

664
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,590
I think we kind of knew could be used

665
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,150
for blue-green deployments.

666
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,140
So blue-green deployments

667
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,510
are where customers would
have two live environments.

668
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,940
There's blue environment, which
is the existing code base,

669
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,080
and they have a green environment,

670
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,913
which is the new code base.

671
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:34,800
And over a period of time
they start moving traffic over

672
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,870
and if everything goes
fine, they switch over

673
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,697
and the green environment
becomes the new environment

674
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,730
and if something goes wrong,

675
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,930
they can quickly flip back
to the blue environment.

676
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,510
So it reduces the risk when
you're deploying software

677
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,980
also makes it much more seamless.

678
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,140
So previously customers used
to use snapshots for that.

679
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,550
So you can imagine if
you're using Snapshot,

680
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,620
as I said, it takes more time.

681
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,380
So as a developer, you're
managing the blue and the green,

682
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,940
the deployments with green environments

683
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,110
for a much longer time, right?

684
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,369
Because you have both of those things

685
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,808
going at the same time.

686
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:05,730
Now with copy,

687
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,690
you can just have the
new environment created,

688
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,290
you still have to manage
the flip over and all that.

689
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,186
That's still on you,

690
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,060
but still is much easier and much simpler

691
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,380
to do than before, right?

692
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,630
So it minimizes you can switch,

693
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,310
minimizes the developer environment

694
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,173
and improves developer agility,

695
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:20,790
which was one of the main
motivations for doing this.

696
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,323
So that's volumes clones.

697
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,850
The other workflow was the golden image,

698
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,790
which you had and you want
it to copy it across regions

699
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,620
to developers all across the world, right?

700
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,470
And as I said, there are
multiple steps in that workflow.

701
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,890
One of the things you have
to do is you create an AMI,

702
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,990
then you copy the AMI
across different regions

703
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,263
and then you create volumes from it.

704
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,960
You don't want, like if a
developer is coming online

705
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,151
in the morning, you
don't want the developer

706
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,800
to deal with a system which is
not fully performing, right?

707
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,740
That's waste of their time
and waste of resources.

708
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,260
So that's one constant feedback we heard.

709
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,260
So copy AMI Workflow by design
is the best effort workflow.

710
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,184
So if you're copying an AMI
across different regions,

711
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:05,220
based on how busy the regions are,

712
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,930
your speeds will vary, right?

713
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,650
So a developer in dub region
would get something faster,

714
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,659
was a developer in Farah
region, for example,

715
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,566
EU West and US2.

716
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:18,003
I use the internal names.

717
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,130
So we launched time-based AMI
copy last year in February.

718
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,080
So you can give us a
time as low as 15 minutes

719
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,820
and we'll make sure
that across all regions

720
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,890
these AMIs get copied
in 15 minutes, right?

721
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,110
So that makes it much easier,

722
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,290
is predictable that the
AMIs are gonna be there.

723
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,870
The other part of the
workflow is creating,

724
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,720
launching an instance from an AMI.

725
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,543
And that triggers pulling
data from the snapshot

726
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:43,470
to the EBS volume, right?

727
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,470
So that workflow is also not predictable.

728
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,510
It's best effort based on EBS snapshot,

729
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,196
how heavy the load is on the snapshot,

730
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:53,010
on the S3 fleet and on
the EBS volume fleet.

731
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,390
So here again we launched provision RAIDO

732
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:58,140
for volume initial initialization,

733
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,550
you can go up to 300 megs.

734
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,110
We ensure that the data gets pulled down

735
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,120
from S3 at that speed, right?

736
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,860
So you know practically when the volume

737
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,860
will be fully ready and you
can give that to your developer

738
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:14,275
and he can be sure that the
volume is fully performed.

739
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,960
Along with that, we also
launched the ability to know

740
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,330
that hey, all the data from the snapshot

741
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,870
is fully pulled on from
into the EBS volume.

742
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,980
So we know that the volume is ready

743
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,344
to take production traffic.

744
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,850
That's available for all volume types,

745
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,070
not just in the context of this feature.

746
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,160
So volume initialization is
one of our basic workflows.

747
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,770
If you think about AMI launches, right?

748
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,960
It triggers the volume
initialization workflow.

749
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,910
And we have seen customers
who have a single AMI

750
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,370
launching hundreds of
instances use this feature

751
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,540
because it gives them predictability

752
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,240
that all those instances are ready

753
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,360
to take on workload production traffic.

754
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,910
We see customers who are
copying environments across AZs

755
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,000
because the copy volume is
an AZ copy of the volume.

756
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,210
If you're copying production
environments across AZs,

757
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,060
this is again useful to make
it predictable and fast.

758
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,670
And lastly, if you are
recovering from a disaster,

759
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,920
you are recovering from
a snapshot to a volume,

760
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,530
you have strict RTOs
recovery time objectives,

761
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,997
this ensures that you're able to meet

762
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:10,853
that recovery point objective.

763
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,650
So it's a core primitive for us

764
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,930
and we are gonna invest
in that to make it faster.

765
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,233
So that's it speeds up a lot of workflows.

766
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,890
Just summarizing all the
things we spoke about here.

767
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,130
So Adam spoke about the real
time transaction system,

768
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,300
extremely latency sensitive.

769
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,290
So we reduced the IO2 BX
volume latency definition

770
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,134
from sub millisecond to
sub 500 microseconds.

771
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:38,550
So you can handle even
stricter latency guidance.

772
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,180
We to make sure that all your customers

773
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,000
can benefit from this latency

774
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,530
we have IO2 worldwide available

775
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,850
so you can develop,

776
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,450
have the same same stack
across the whole whole world.

777
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,310
We launched metrics,
performance exceeded checks,

778
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,500
so volume exceeded checks
we launched last year

779
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,990
and instance exceeded check
we launched this year.

780
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,160
So in a stack it's very easy

781
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,810
to figure out if the
bottleneck is the instance

782
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,220
or is the volume.

783
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,290
We launched average
latency metrics last year,

784
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,030
average IOPS and throughput this year.

785
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,540
So you can trend your performance
over a period of time,

786
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,080
put in alarms and figure out
when something is going wrong.

787
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,040
On the resiliency side,

788
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,680
we talked about latency
injection with FIS,

789
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,780
fault injection simulator.

790
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,010
We had launched pausing I/O in 2023

791
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,000
that basically simulates,

792
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,800
hey, if you have timer in your stack,

793
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,227
how does it propagate
from the storage upwards?

794
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:30,750
If you have certain alarms,

795
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,890
how does that propagate?

796
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,570
In this year we launched the ability

797
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,730
to inject latency into
your data part, right?

798
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,020
And we have four templates,

799
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,370
but you can also create your own template

800
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,510
with redirect mixes

801
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,672
and how much microseconds of latency

802
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:43,410
you want on the read
part, on the write part.

803
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,590
And lastly, customers
accidentally delete data,

804
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,940
delete a volume, delete a snapshot.

805
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,920
We had recycled bin
production for snapshots.

806
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,590
We extended that to volumes as well.

807
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,600
On the analytical warehouse system,

808
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,940
you need a lot of speed
to pull data from S3

809
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,170
into the EBS fleet.

810
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,972
So we have larger and faster
single volume GP3 volumes,

811
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:03,348
RAGB with one 50 GBP as a bandwidth

812
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:07,006
and 720K IOPS, as I mentioned
also helps your OLTP systems

813
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:11,220
the larger and faster GP3
makes test dev environments

814
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,140
much more simpler to use

815
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,910
and the REGB enables you

816
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:19,563
to land even larger and larger
workloads on top of EBS.

817
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,840
And for dev environments,

818
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,120
for developer environment to
improve developer agility,

819
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,440
we launch volume clones.

820
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,510
We can create instantly
create a performance volume

821
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,400
from another EBS volume

822
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,261
in the same AZ provision
RAIDO for initialization

823
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:36,330
and time-based AMI copy
makes having a golden image

824
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,360
and copying it across the
globe much more easier,

825
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,850
initialization status helps you understand

826
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,410
when your volume is fully ready

827
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,520
and you can put that in production

828
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,650
to take on latency sensitive applications.

829
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,605
So that's the bunch of
features we launched this year.

830
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,580
These are the others EBS sessions
if you are interested in.

831
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,670
The last one is about
networking and EBS workloads,

832
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,412
if you like that and he'll
be there for that session.

833
00:35:58,412 --> 00:36:00,070
So I can go for that one

834
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,788
and then Aaron and I
will be hanging out here.

835
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:04,770
So if you have any questions, let us know.

836
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,710
Please take the survey,
we read all the surveys.

837
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,420
If you can put notes
in there, that's great

838
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,582
'cause we look at that and figure out

839
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:13,193
how to make the session better next year.

840
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:14,520
But thanks for coming.

841
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,260
I know it's a very late session,

842
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,240
so we appreciate you all being here.

843
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,073
Thank you.
