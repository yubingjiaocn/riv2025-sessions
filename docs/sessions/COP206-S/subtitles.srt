1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,760
- We're gonna cover a topic

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,730
that's often neglected in
observability, actually.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,760
So I want you to imagine
as we go through this talk,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,850
this is a relatively
straightforward case study.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,950
You guys hear me okay?

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,410
Oh, that's so many
thumbs up. This is great.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,390
Okay. There's positivity.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,120
So one of the things that
really comes up very commonly is

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,740
organizations talk about
things like observability being

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,450
very, very expensive.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,573
They also talk about things
like the value being unclear,

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,640
super interesting industry

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,050
because often there is a
budget for observability.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,000
It's fundamentally really important.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,070
It's very difficult to
operate the software

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,730
that drives our businesses and
our bottom line without it.

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,990
So we know how essential it is

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,390
and yet we still feel
it's very, very expensive.

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,560
The theory here, and I think
it's it bears true over

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,020
and over again, is that actually
it's not really about it

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,370
being too high a price.

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,920
It's that the value is unclear.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,290
And so what this talk
is kind of an example,

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,980
taking probably some of
the most unstructured

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,110
like simple data that we can take

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,480
and apply a few different
transformations in enrichments.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,820
And we end up with something
that can be carried all the way

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,250
to our C-suite and we can
tell 'em about it, a message

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,260
that can be carried
across the entire company.

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,020
And that is a fundamental
component of business growth.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,570
We'll talk about how information
flows through a company.

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,620
We'll talk about the
importance of technical events

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,590
and what they actually mean
across the entire company.

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,900
And once again, I'm
talking about very simple

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,980
data here for a reason.

36
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,050
This is what you can do
with even the simplest

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,730
data in a few lookup tables.

38
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,000
You can imagine what can be
achieved when you have full APM,

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,410
traces, logs, metrics.

40
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,240
When you can correlate
those things together,

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,060
you can tell a much, much richer story.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,063
So quickly about Coralogix,

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,240
we launched 2017.

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,820
The platform has grown massively.

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,770
I've been at Coralogix
for about four years

46
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,750
and in that time we gained

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,360
thousands of thousands of customers.

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,830
Big thing, eight high availability

49
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,240
regions including GovCloud.

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,957
And we are FedRAMP ready.

51
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:12,060
So we are gonna go fully
approved mid next year.

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,190
So we're going through
that process right now.

53
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,720
The high availability regions mean

54
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,490
that we have multiple
deployments in these regions

55
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,190
and that includes if you
have a European presence

56
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,390
and you have GDPR requirements.

57
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,730
For example, we have European
places, we have East coast

58
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,560
and West coast deployments in the US

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,410
and as I mentioned, GovCloud as well.

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,940
Super important of course, these days,

61
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,943
data residency regulations
are becoming tighter.

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,570
So yeah, and, you know,
raised a great deal of money

63
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,960
in funding and now we're moving
to the stage where we scale

64
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,920
and we start to think more

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,770
deeply about what the customers need.

66
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,533
This slide we bring out a lot

67
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,510
and it's super, super interesting.

68
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,870
So one of the things that I
think really sets us apart

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,130
as a company is the platform
is awesome, but the support

70
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,293
and services are really next level.

71
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:02,100
This is most aptly exemplified by this,

72
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,650
less than 30 second median response time.

73
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,620
That's no bots, no L1 engineers.

74
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,640
It's straight to a person whose
whole job is to figure out

75
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,140
what the problems are in observability

76
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,000
stacks and help you fix them.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,753
But the engagement goes beyond that.

78
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:19,530
And this is kind of what a
part of this talk is about.

79
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,530
The engagement goes beyond
just problem resolution.

80
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,561
It's what are your goals

81
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:26,423
and how can we move you
towards achieving them.

82
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,860
Less than one hour median resolve time.

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,680
To give you an idea, the next fastest

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,750
response time is about three hours.

85
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,360
So a median response, our
resolve time right now is faster

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,723
than the response to MSLA
of our closest competitor.

87
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,690
And there's no tiering
in the solution either.

88
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,160
So there's no enterprise packages

89
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,993
or anything like that,

90
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,430
that's just charged by gigabyte ingested.

91
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,142
If you ingest one gigabyte, you get this.

92
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:50,975
This is something we've scaled

93
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,770
and that some of you have gone, hmm?

94
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,610
And the reason why is

95
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,825
because you wonder how we've got scale,

96
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,400
how are we gonna scale that kind of thing?

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,753
When I first started at Coralogix four

98
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,923
years ago, we had about, I think about

99
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,950
2,000 customers, just under.

100
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,670
And we used to advertise a five
minute median response time.

101
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,515
Now it's over 4,000 customers

102
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,810
and we are less than 30
second median response.

103
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,989
We've actually got faster as we've scaled.

104
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,470
It's a big, big thing

105
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,650
with automation internally,
heavy documentation.

106
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,930
But we have 80 people in
our support organization

107
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,956
and we're a company of 600.

108
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:23,943
Ultimately one of the
things we identified was,

109
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,410
is a big problem in this industry

110
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,883
and that the supports does not match

111
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:28,716
the importance of the software.

112
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:31,290
So observability is
becoming like a core pillar

113
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,310
of how we run our businesses.

114
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,540
It's becoming a really important

115
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,160
part of how we operate and grow.

116
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Not just our software but
our practices as teams.

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,780
Many of us will be
thinking about things like

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,250
service level objectives.

119
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,860
We'll be thinking about high
level table stakes metrics

120
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,410
to make sure that you can,
the teams can make autonomous

121
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,830
decisions within sensible
frameworks, all essential

122
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,560
for scale software engineering,
all powered by observability

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,360
and without the observability, very,

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
very difficult to achieve.

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,180
So that's the reason why
we offer this support

126
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,310
because it matches the
importance of the software,

127
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,075
matches the importance of the application.

128
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,390
And of course cost optimization support.

129
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,980
So we have some of the best

130
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,380
cost optimization tools in the market

131
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,963
and we can talk about those later.

132
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:11,820
And the migration times are crazy fast.

133
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,290
You can check the case
studies on the website,

134
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,980
but we have multiple like 24
to 48 hour turnaround times

135
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,300
for full stack logs, metrics

136
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,553
and traces from very large engagements.

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,740
That's largely powered by our

138
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,480
commitment to use OpenTelemetry.

139
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,730
OpenTelemetry beat.
We'll do a show of hands.

140
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,680
Everyone familiar with OpenTelemetry?

141
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:30,838
In this crowd,

142
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:31,671
I imagine it's gonna
be pretty, yeah, yeah.

143
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,670
So OpenTelemetry for the one

144
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,010
or two hands that didn't
go up is a collection

145
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,320
of software collectors.

146
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,230
So it's a collector that
actually captures the telemetry.

147
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,063
SDKs.

148
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:42,600
So it goes inside your code base

149
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,470
and it'll help you generate

150
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,270
the telemetry you need to generate.

151
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,800
Standards and protocols.

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,650
So standards and protocols
like the OTLP protocol,

153
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,930
which is the actual,

154
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,240
like the actual informational protocol

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
that communicates the
telemetry, logs, metrics

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,480
and traces profiles, security events

157
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,890
and so on up to an OTLP
compliant collector,

158
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,322
much like Coralogix, Coralogix
is fully OTel compatible.

159
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:09,658
In fact our APM and our
tracing is OTel native.

160
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:11,790
So there's no, some of the other vendors,

161
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,140
what they do is they say they use OTel,

162
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,071
but when you use it you lose a

163
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:16,110
bunch of features or something.

164
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,290
That's not us. You get full
feature coverage with OTel.

165
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,690
That's how we run that and it's
been very, very beneficial.

166
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,880
It means the migrations are
really easy If you're using TEL

167
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,860
today, it's typically a few lines

168
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,242
of config in your OTel config.

169
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,270
It's very, very easy.

170
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,612
Very briefly about myself,

171
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:33,750
I, my whole background is SRE

172
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,790
and software engineering basically.

173
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,640
When I told people I go
into software engineering,

174
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,050
they asked me if I can fix computers

175
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,940
and I didn't know how to
explain to them that most

176
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,970
of it is breaking computers
and it's great fun

177
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,470
and the, yeah.

178
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,110
And then I moved into
engineering leadership a lot.

179
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,670
Very, very large retailer in the UK.

180
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,266
I was responsible for a
hundred million dollars

181
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,450
of cloud and on-premise infrastructure.

182
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,630
And my job was to try to
coalesce around tools,

183
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,170
especially hosting and
observability tools, helping,

184
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,246
I think it was two

185
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:03,780
and a half thousand
engineers across hundreds

186
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,053
of teams in I think every time zone.

187
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,030
Trying to get them all in the same

188
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,740
line was interesting.

189
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,630
And I realized at that point that

190
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,100
what I should be doing is evangelism,

191
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,200
'cause that was more
or less my job anyway.

192
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,180
So I tried a few different roles

193
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,970
and I landed at Coralogix four years ago.

194
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,250
And since then we've grown
the evangelism program.

195
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,692
We have people in the states,
in the UK, in Tel Aviv

196
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,840
where we are constantly going to customers

197
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,127
and just talking to them
and hanging out with them

198
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,960
and working out what their problems are

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,000
and saying, well what, you know, what's,

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,340
and it can be anything
from I can't get this

201
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,420
configuration to work.

202
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,760
This OTel configuration
isn't playing nicely for me,

203
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,700
or my teams just don't understand
service level objectives

204
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,380
and I'm struggling to
get 'em on board with it.

205
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,519
And we engage across that entire thing.

206
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,370
And I'll talk a bit about that
later with the maturity model

207
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,553
that we've made that helps
to contextualize that.

208
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,610
So the premise of this
talk is very simple.

209
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,993
There's a common, common
misconception in a company,

210
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,290
which is that there is the tech side

211
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,600
and then there's like the businessy side.

212
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,950
Hands if you've seen that before?

213
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,570
It's like, yeah,

214
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,520
like tech tech in a room somewhere

215
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,803
and business are off
doing businessy things.

216
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,250
And the problem with this
misconception is that it,

217
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,600
it's just not, well

218
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
fundamentally it's just not true anymore.

219
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,440
It maybe was true a long time
ago when tech was a niche part

220
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,910
of the company, but now it's a

221
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,860
horizontal enabler for everything.

222
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,240
Companies that have the best tech

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,830
compete better in the business.

224
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,190
It's all mixed together.

225
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,000
But the problem is, is that
many of the tools that we use

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,140
to measure and track
events, correlate instances

227
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,830
of things happening, still
operate with this in mind.

228
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,090
There's like a techie interface

229
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,340
and there's a businessy
interface and so on.

230
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,830
The problem is siloing of
information is really difficult.

231
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,240
It causes big problems.

232
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,340
You cannot correlate
across siloed information.

233
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,990
You can do it but with great difficulty

234
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,430
and a lot of manual work.

235
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,930
So getting everything to
one place very important.

236
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,590
And the problem with this
assumption fundamentally is this,

237
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,380
if you have a CTO, an
engineering director,

238
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,410
engineering manager and some
technical event has happened,

239
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,210
then it kind of goes up that track

240
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,120
and it only really makes its
way out if it's important,

241
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,580
significant enough, quote unquote.

242
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,879
But the definition of significant enough

243
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,030
is often not codified.

244
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,100
Marketing insights make
their way up to the CMO,

245
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,893
but they don't really go anywhere else.

246
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:20,644
And sales insights often make their way up

247
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,600
to the chief sales officer,

248
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,030
the chief revenue officer, and
they don't go anywhere else.

249
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,650
But I as an engineer might
be interested in the sales

250
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,060
insight 'cause it's
something a customer said,

251
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,580
it might actually be quite
interesting to know what,

252
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,020
we don't do our sales process this way

253
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,760
because the product doesn't facilitate it.

254
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
That's interesting. As an
engineer, I wouldn't know that.

255
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,430
I might have a marketing
insight, the drop off on pages,

256
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,032
the bounce rate on pages,
these are all things

257
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:45,611
that marketing teams tend to measure,

258
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:46,444
but they are technical measurements

259
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,420
that apply across the entire company.

260
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,030
And so how do we change
this flow of information?

261
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,531
So what we don't wanna do is
we don't wanna end up in a

262
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,620
situation like this where we kind

263
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,260
of rely on just ad hoc collaboration,

264
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,660
which is most companies
like vast, vast majority

265
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,190
of companies, why don't we wanna

266
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,510
rely on ad hoc collaboration?

267
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,730
It is basically, it's
based on the goodwill

268
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,750
and the friendship of a very,

269
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,760
typically a very small group of people.

270
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,563
For any of you who've, I'll
do a final show of hands.

271
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:12,163
This is my favorite thing to do.

272
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,930
Who's been in your company,
in your current employment,

273
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,953
one year or more?

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,730
Yeah. Two years or
more, keep the hands up.

275
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,380
Three years or more?

276
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,340
Four years or more?

277
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,630
Five?

278
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,580
We'll jump 10. Yeah.

279
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,080
Okay, thank you.

280
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,580
So if you've been in there 10 years

281
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,680
or more, you start to
pretty much know everybody

282
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,870
and you it, it stops becoming
about following processes

283
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,700
like, oh, I know, I know the person.

284
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,990
So that is an ad hoc

285
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,270
engagement and there's
nothing wrong with that.

286
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,920
It's great to have that
as a natural thing,

287
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,090
but it's not the bedrock.

288
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,200
The bedrock needs to be the flow

289
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,180
of information naturally
is making its way across.

290
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,972
And the way you do that
is by joined up tooling.

291
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,430
So you, you wanna avoid that.

292
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,450
You wanna try and get away from this.

293
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,730
And when we think about
software events, they,

294
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,400
these technical moments,
they impact everybody.

295
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,270
Okay, if I have an API
slow down, then it is going

296
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,760
to impact every single part
portion of that company

297
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,230
if you're a technical company.

298
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,260
Because if your API is slowing
down, your pages load slower,

299
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,440
your marketing, the landing page

300
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,820
that your marketing team just set up

301
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,170
may load slower as well.

302
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,600
There may be ripple effects
across your entire stack.

303
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,950
Really important.

304
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,810
So the really, really important thing

305
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,580
to recognize here is these
technical moments need

306
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,830
to be surfaced in a way
that's really significant.

307
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,530
Right now, they tend to go up
that technical track, right?

308
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,730
If I see a CPU spike, I get
told the CTO gets told about it,

309
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,780
but it doesn't make its way out

310
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,190
horizontally in a natural way.

311
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,340
It's not common anyway.

312
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:37,530
So how do we do something in practice?

313
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,640
That's all the high level stuff.

314
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,670
How do we actually take a very,
very low level simple signal

315
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,790
and turn it into something that
we can communicate upwards?

316
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,240
So lemme give you an example.

317
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,718
We have a log like
this, it's unstructured.

318
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,913
There's nothing particularly
remarkable about it.

319
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,181
This is kind of cool by the way.

320
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,014
This is like a log
summary thing that we do.

321
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:59,610
If anyone's using, anyone
using Coralogix today, yeah,

322
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,810
go to a log, hit space.

323
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,430
Yeah, this guy, it's really cool.

324
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,112
There's loads of Easter
eggs in the app like that

325
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:06,720
and this will like pull
out all the metadata

326
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,950
that's automatically recognized.

327
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,400
There's trace IDs in there
for trace correlation,

328
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,030
but the log itself is
not particularly useful.

329
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,440
If you took that and you said, Hey,

330
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,970
I have an RPC not found error

331
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,340
and you go to someone non-technical,
they're gonna be like,

332
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,540
what the hell are you talking about?

333
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,710
There's business context to this.

334
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,370
This happens during a a checkout process.

335
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,710
So every single time this
happens, someone tried

336
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,270
to buy something and they couldn't.

337
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,830
That's the business
context of this message.

338
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,430
Okay, so we, we can see
something interesting in there.

339
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,950
This ID on the end,

340
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,090
and this is something we
might wanna filter on.

341
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,703
So we can take that technical
signal and we can pass

342
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:45,210
and extract the really essential values,

343
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,043
the ones that really matter.

344
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:47,250
Why is that important?

345
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,950
It allows you to index the
fields that really matter.

346
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,110
And then you can do things
like query and filter

347
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,850
and you can aggregate on
various different things.

348
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,060
You can join and pivot and I
can show you how to do that.

349
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,050
And then you can enrich.

350
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,230
Enrichment is something
that I think I never see

351
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,080
and we do it a lot in
the Coralogix platform.

352
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,913
What is enrichment?

353
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:06,330
Enrichment is when you have some kind

354
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,860
of field and you say, okay,

355
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,281
but I have tons of metadata around this ID

356
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:13,080
and I wanna add the metadata into my log.

357
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,980
Now why do you wanna do that?

358
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,910
Because then you have a single

359
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,620
document with all the
context that you need,

360
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,620
that's really important
for like in-depth analysis.

361
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,250
And finally you can convert
that data into something useful.

362
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,990
And what I mean by something
useful, I mean something

363
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,150
that you can take and you
can take all the way up

364
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,200
to the C level and say, hey,

365
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,120
this is a significant
thing and here's why.

366
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,077
And they'll understand it.

367
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,850
And that's the flow of information working

368
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,933
in a less ad hoc way.

369
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,540
So you can begin by
creating a lookup table.

370
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,180
So in Coralogix we have this
idea called data sets. Okay?

371
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,400
Now a data set is a bit
like a table in a database.

372
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,050
It's a collection of similar data.

373
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,308
It doesn't have to be all
the same structure and shape,

374
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,520
but it's similar data.

375
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,400
It doesn't have to be time
series. So this is a lookup.

376
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,379
Now notice the ID on the left hand side

377
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,740
looks much like the ID we
saw in the previous log.

378
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,650
So, and we have a bunch of
product information here.

379
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,700
So what could we do with that?

380
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,350
Well this is a lookup table
with which we can enrich.

381
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,595
So what we can do is use our
language called DataPrime.

382
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,820
So DataPrime is an analytics
language that we use.

383
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,537
You can query logs, metrics
and traces in a single query.

384
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,963
It supports all the things

385
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,060
that you would expect
from something like SQL.

386
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,650
So joins and filters

387
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,130
and aggregations and counting and so on.

388
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,390
In this particular example,
what we do is we take

389
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,415
that custom data set product details

390
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:30,300
and we will join the original log on it.

391
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,590
And notice here, we've on the fly,

392
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,130
we've extracted the product
ID as a field onto itself.

393
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,690
So now we have a product
ID that's own field

394
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,160
and we say, Hey, join on that

395
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,690
and give me everything
from that lookup table

396
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,760
that's relevant to that ID.

397
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,150
And that turns the original thing into

398
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,980
something that's a bit more interesting.

399
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,530
So what I can do is that once
I know the price of the item

400
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,020
and I know it was a checkout
process that was failing,

401
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,730
I can start asking questions,

402
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,280
how much money are we
losing as a result of that?

403
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,750
Okay, so when you go to your boss

404
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,570
and you say, I have a not found OPC error,

405
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,490
that's tough to say.

406
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,410
If you go to your boss and
say, in the last 15 minutes we

407
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,720
just lost $1,500 due to this bug,

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,133
that's a compelling message.

409
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,860
That will take people's attention.

410
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,577
So this massaging and
preparation of data is really,

411
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:15,660
really important for a number of things.

412
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,533
Now I'll double click on them.

413
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,130
One, once you get your data into a more,

414
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,560
let's say organized shape,
I think one of the things

415
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,760
that we did in observability,

416
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,730
for a long time don't remember this.

417
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,620
This is an example if I,
the common pattern was,

418
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,620
and in in many places still
is I take some data, all

419
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,290
of it goes into sort of high
performance index storage,

420
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,340
open store, OpenSearch with a
SSD hard drives underneath it,

421
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,180
something like that.

422
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,790
And then after like two
weeks it goes into some sort

423
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,500
of low cost storage compressed.

424
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,510
If we ever wanna access it
again, we have to go back

425
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,730
to low cost storage and pull it back out.

426
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,697
And the, the assumption
of that is that all

427
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:54,300
of the data is equal 'cause it's all

428
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,980
being traced in the same way.

429
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,813
Which is not true.

430
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,440
Some logs only become useful

431
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,460
after a certain amount of time.

432
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,230
Some traces are only only useful

433
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,157
for 10 seconds when they happen.

434
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:05,179
So we have to treat data differently.

435
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,610
So what we can do here is that the really,

436
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,590
really fun edition is that
this is actually being queried

437
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,730
directly from S3 as well.

438
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,448
This is actually all held
in customer cloud S3,

439
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:16,408
which is a significant detail.

440
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,060
So that's really important

441
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,710
because now I have a business insight.

442
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,330
It's something that I can take to people,

443
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,180
I can communicate it to anybody
and it's really easy to do.

444
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,770
So why are we doing this?

445
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,480
Why am I stood up here
talking about business

446
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,430
insights as an SRE?

447
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,000
Because I've started
with a very simple log.

448
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,473
Now imagine what you can do
with things like a trace.

449
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:38,076
It's got a bunch of metadata
on there that you've added in.

450
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:40,411
And because we're using
an enrichment model,

451
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,240
we're not talking about going

452
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,830
and changing 500 applications

453
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,530
to make sure a correlation idea
is making its way in there.

454
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,240
What we're talking about
is taking the stuff

455
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,778
that's already in there and
saying, oh I can enrich on

456
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:53,250
that if this tag relates
to this particular server,

457
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,710
I can enrich based on that server.

458
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,720
If it's based in a certain
region or a department

459
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,742
or any metadata that exists,
I can enrich on those fields.

460
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:03,060
So the enrichment model amplifies

461
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,410
the fields that are already there.

462
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,854
And if you want, you
can add more at source.

463
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:09,270
And the reason why I'm
talking about this is

464
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,541
because we've built this thing,

465
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,822
it's the observability maturity model.

466
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,780
It's broken down to four different levels.

467
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,220
There's something really
significant about this.

468
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,440
We are bringing this to every
single one of our customers.

469
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,970
It is a north star vision for

470
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,770
how observability is moving forward.

471
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,990
Level one is essentially
telemetry coverage.

472
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,740
It's getting a stack of full
stack telemetry, so logs,

473
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,500
metrics, traces, profiles,
events and so on.

474
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,940
It's basically just getting coverage

475
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,670
for this stuff you've already got.

476
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,060
Why is that level one?

477
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,440
It's very, very difficult

478
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,980
to progress in this with
massive gaps in your data.

479
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,110
And a big problem today,
especially with a lot

480
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,570
of the vendors, is that
people make these massive cost

481
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,583
optimizations by not
sending logs for example,

482
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,370
which is tough.

483
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,893
It makes causal analysis
very, very difficult.

484
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,520
So avoiding those gaps is
really, really important.

485
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,980
The next level is
engineering intelligence.

486
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,320
And this is where most of us
get to and what we describe one

487
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,610
and two is like a generic problem.

488
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,190
So engineering intelligence
is things like you have a

489
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,100
telemetry, you coalesce
it around your databases

490
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,960
or your infrastructure or your servers

491
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,510
or the processes running
on your servers and so on.

492
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,230
Super important because this is the,

493
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,910
almost the gold standard for
SRE today is defining SLOs,

494
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,633
consistent measurements across
teams, that kind of thing.

495
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,430
This is where, there are observability

496
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,690
maturity models out there today

497
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,840
and they all stop here.

498
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,563
And one of the things

499
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:34,743
that we realized was
there is this big problem

500
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,140
that I mentioned at the
start of this talk, which is

501
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,970
that the feeling is
we're not getting enough

502
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,350
value outta this data.

503
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,730
The feeling is is that we're not getting

504
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,410
the return that we expected.

505
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,170
How do we maximize the return
that we can possibly get

506
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,900
as engineers, but also as
people working in a business?

507
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,630
How do we connect these
deeply technical signals

508
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,180
to business growth and to
business impacting measurements?

509
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,340
What we do is we start,
start to say things like,

510
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,049
well let's take all that
engineering knowledge

511
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,810
and put it into a production context.

512
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,540
Production context means rather
than just saying my API has

513
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,700
breached my 500 millisecond SLO,

514
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,160
it's what was the customer impact of that?

515
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,200
And those, that's where
things like APM become really,

516
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,250
really useful 'cause you can actually

517
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,630
measure the thing over time.

518
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,550
But DataPrime and I showed you before,

519
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,460
allows you to crunch all that
data in new and custom ways.

520
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,070
The necessity of a really flexible,

521
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,520
really rich query language is fundamental

522
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,600
to the whole process.

523
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,213
It's very difficult to get
this done without that.

524
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:28,445
And the the second thing
that's really, really important

525
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:30,690
as you're moving into the later parts

526
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,850
of the maturity model is
you have to have access

527
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,980
to a significant portion of your data.

528
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,560
Without it, it's really, really difficult.

529
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,720
If you, for example, as many
of the customers I've spoken

530
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,410
to do, they don't produce
traces, it's just too expensive

531
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,710
or it's just not scaling
for them or whatever.

532
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,830
We can have a really,
really good go at this,

533
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,080
but it's hard because the
traces give you a really good

534
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,490
visibility of how the different

535
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,990
services are talking with one another.

536
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,980
They have help you identify

537
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,720
bottlenecks and performance issues.

538
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,636
Root cause analysis is really
a lot easier with traces,

539
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:02,910
much like without logs by the way.

540
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,170
There's a lot of talk now about removing

541
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,760
logs entirely from the whole thing.

542
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,740
I understand that, I think logs are

543
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,330
great for causal analysis.

544
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,800
Having just metrics for example,

545
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
you can tell you what's happening.

546
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,950
There's a CPU spike, it's very difficult

547
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,862
to understand the why and
logs often have the context

548
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:18,240
for the why but that, so having

549
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,100
that data in the first
place is really important.

550
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,013
That's why it's level
one. Without major gaps.

551
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,530
So we've taken our engineering knowledge,

552
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,990
we've put it into production context

553
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,330
and we're saying things
like, rather than just SLOs,

554
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,950
what does this mean to the
customer relationships?

555
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,453
How have we breached our SLAs?

556
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,180
And that's really, it's so useful.

557
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,460
You know, you can imagine
a VP of engineering

558
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,490
or a sort of CCTO level who's
getting pressure about these

559
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,490
things can go to a dashboard
and analyze that directly.

560
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,450
It's not some derived

561
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,820
calculation or something
they're told about.

562
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,770
One of the practices that some
of our customers have started

563
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,910
doing, which I love, is they
have started to define SLOs

564
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,890
and then SLAs in the same dashboard

565
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,570
and they've defined their
SLOs as a little bit

566
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,670
of a padding between their SLAs.

567
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,549
And so the SLOs become a leading indicator

568
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:03,540
for breaching their SLAs.

569
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,530
Super cool.

570
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,940
And that's a really, really nice example

571
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,220
of applying this kind of logic.

572
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,394
So reproduction intelligence.

573
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,610
There is the level four.

574
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,700
Now one, two, and three I
think standalone in the sense

575
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,530
that they're about
responding to incidents.

576
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,720
If there's an issue,
did we breach our SLA?

577
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,553
If there's a problem,

578
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:21,360
what was the impact to the customer?

579
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,650
Level four is different.

580
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,110
Level four is where you just
go deep diving into your data

581
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,360
to find stuff out like we just did.

582
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,681
So I I we said before,

583
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:31,320
this is just a background
hum error that's happening.

584
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,810
There's no major outage, there
was no spike or anything.

585
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,294
We just started investigating stuff

586
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,130
and this is this, the
power of DataPrime here is

587
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,690
that we can enrich it

588
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,129
and decorate it with enough information

589
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:44,583
to produce a business impacting insight.

590
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,620
Really, really important.

591
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,420
So the business insights there is

592
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,300
about basically turning
this disparate collection

593
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,170
of technical signals into
something that anything can use.

594
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,480
And I, before I mentioned
there was two reasons why.

595
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,880
So I talked about maturity
model when you're getting

596
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,400
to this point, is any of you
looking at like AI agents

597
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,080
or anything like that around
your telemetry right now?

598
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,900
Any hands? Yeah, so it's cool
we're getting there slowly.

599
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,302
Yeah.

600
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:10,920
So one of the most important things

601
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,911
when you're using like any kind

602
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,370
of agent interface with your
telemetry, there's a lot

603
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,940
of telemetry and your agent
has a limited context window.

604
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,370
There's only so much you
can look at at one time.

605
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,220
Well organized data means
that your agent can decide,

606
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,680
make decisions about
which part to look at.

607
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,223
So we have Olly, for example,

608
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,450
which is our observability agent.

609
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,670
It knows how to query
logs, metrics and traces

610
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,685
or do full root cause analysis.

611
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,650
When you organize your data
into things like data sets,

612
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,860
as I mentioned, it knows
where to look, it knows to go

613
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,240
and look at data sets or it knows to go

614
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,040
and look at certain fields and so on.

615
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,300
And by organizing your data,

616
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,460
your AI tools actually have an easier time

617
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,690
of making this analysis.

618
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,100
That's really, really important.

619
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,990
And people often think
that like organized data is

620
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,160
for people and all, it's not,

621
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,867
it's for anything that
needs to communicate it.

622
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:57,989
We, we don't often spend
time organizing our telemetry

623
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,570
and I think it's, it's
often seen as not necessary,

624
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,727
but when we do it, we get
so many benefits from it

625
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,512
and it's really, really significant.

626
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:08,234
So we've mentioned that level
one, level two about coverage

627
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:11,070
and engineering insight and level three

628
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,635
and four are about putting
that engineering insight

629
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,493
into the context of your business.

630
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,190
For those of you who don't
know, our company goal,

631
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,860
our mission is to help
companies make better decisions.

632
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,480
That's right at the top of this thing.

633
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,700
Now if if you wanna start this journey

634
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,440
with your observability data,

635
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,530
you need a platform that
has the necessary features.

636
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,910
There's a reason why we're,

637
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,340
a lot of the industry is
coalescing around things like APM

638
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,530
and Rome, security monitoring,

639
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,990
infrastructure monitoring
log analytics and so on.

640
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,970
You need a platform that
has all these things,

641
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,530
otherwise it's very
difficult to get ahead.

642
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,380
It's very difficult to make progress.

643
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,500
The first half of that maturity model is

644
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,610
mostly about the data.

645
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,760
In fact, I'll show you.

646
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,080
All of this, if you look here,

647
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,180
it's kind of mostly about the data

648
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,220
and getting it into okay shape.

649
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,834
And the second half of this maturity model

650
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,900
is about practices and processes.

651
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,630
So it's about mature
data and mature teams.

652
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,330
I was, years and years ago I was working

653
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,724
at a betting company

654
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,920
and I discovered through
just messing around with some

655
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,280
of the logs that we were
losing money at two racetracks.

656
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,960
And I remember sitting back

657
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
and going, cool, and I got on with coding.

658
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,917
I didn't do anything with it.

659
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:23,850
And I spoke to a lot

660
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,500
of people at the time and
a lot of people had similar

661
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,850
experiences where they found something

662
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,750
but they were like, well that's not

663
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,460
really my thing, whatever.

664
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,960
So if someone had come to me

665
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,870
and said, Hey, you should take
this to the betting manager

666
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,760
or to a certain part of the company,

667
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,593
that's really important.

668
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:37,890
That would've been a big
thing for the company.

669
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,420
Six weeks later the
product manager came to me

670
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,500
and said, Hey, did you know we're losing

671
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,580
money at these two racetracks?

672
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,080
I was like, oh, never heard of it.

673
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,900
So it's a remarkable thing.

674
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,090
When you, the reason why we do
our engagement the way we do,

675
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,550
the reason why the DevRel team, my team,

676
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,020
engage with customers
is the way they do it is

677
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,820
because so many teams just need

678
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,920
that extra little lift to move forward.

679
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,530
We find that momentum in these
companies is so important

680
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,397
and the way you do that
is things like hackathons,

681
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:02,190
fun engagements that are just there

682
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,930
to strengthen the relationship
with the customer,

683
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,150
but also give the teams
the effective ability

684
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,627
to make the best use of the platform.

685
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:09,930
Observability is such a niche space.

686
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,980
I think we forget that sometimes,

687
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,880
especially for any of us who are fans.

688
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,960
And so, 'cause we think about
it all the time, we forget

689
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,621
that most people are thinking
about things like server

690
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:20,627
uptime and they just wanna
keep the thing running.

691
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:24,300
So we, when we get ourselves
into this space, we have

692
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,100
to remember that education is a

693
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,510
fundamental part of observability.

694
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,330
And this kind of strategy
is only gonna be powered

695
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,130
by education and engagement in that way.

696
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,958
That's the reason why the
DevRel team, a core part of

697
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,090
how we are measured is the number

698
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,650
of engagements we have with customers.

699
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,940
The number and the creativity

700
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,213
and the timeliness of
those engagements as well.

701
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,620
So it's all well

702
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,520
and good me saying this, how
mature teams mature data driven

703
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,500
by a great platform accelerated

704
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,940
by artificial intelligence will get you

705
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,305
to better decision making.

706
00:25:52,305 --> 00:25:54,240
But it's already happening
in a lot of customers.

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,549
So trade web for example,
sending us 130 terabytes

708
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,290
of data a day, they had a
business problem, which was

709
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,037
that they, their audit process
was taking a very long time

710
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:06,810
and because they had a rehydration
model on that telemetry.

711
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,300
So as I mentioned before, the
data comes in, they hold it

712
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,250
for a couple of weeks
and then they compress it

713
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,020
and they put it into somewhere else.

714
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,010
And what we did was we said, well

715
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,300
the data prem query engine
allows you to query your data

716
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,730
as often as you like at no
additional cost with data

717
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,710
that's held in cloud object
storage in your account.

718
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,663
S3 for the AWS context.

719
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,730
What does that mean?

720
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,437
You can do audit queries in
seconds, not in two weeks,

721
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:32,850
two week turnaround times.

722
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,080
That's a business problem.

723
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,913
When when I go to people

724
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:37,470
and say, what does an great
observability stack do for you?

725
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,900
People talk about APM
and service visibility.

726
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,010
I don't think anybody has said to me,

727
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,960
it would be great if it could
help with my audit problems.

728
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,390
It's pretty rare, but it happens

729
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,040
and it's significant, meaningful.

730
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,283
Soft2Bet.

731
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,430
Another example, this slide

732
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,750
says they're growing really fast.

733
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,700
This slide says they're
sending 65 terabytes.

734
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,533
We're actually sending more like

735
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,747
140 terabytes to us right now.

736
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:59,030
Full stack logs, metrics and traces.

737
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,136
A really, really interesting
use case where we, we started

738
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:05,670
with focusing on things like mean times

739
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,250
to acknowledge, mean times to recovery.

740
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,710
But actually we got really
wrapped up in the adoption side

741
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,780
of things because we just be,

742
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,400
we saw there was this groundswell momentum

743
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,830
within the company, very
big company distributed.

744
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,950
And so 90% of all the
dashboards being used today,

745
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,348
our Coralogix dashboards that
includes business people,

746
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:27,090
that's 90% of the company are
using Coralogix dashboards.

747
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,960
And what does that mean?

748
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,100
That means the same insight are

749
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,600
being shared across the entire company

750
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,400
because they have a shared platform.

751
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,516
Really, really important.

752
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:36,480
And of course it's always nice

753
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,280
to have your meantime
to acknowledge halved

754
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,850
and your meantime to
recovery reduced by 30%.

755
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,503
It's always a nice added bonus.

756
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,710
And we actually help
their teams move faster.

757
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,720
I dunno if anyone's like
familiar with the gaming space

758
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,410
or anything, but it's brutally competitive

759
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,857
and it changes so, so fast.

760
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:56,970
Teams that are able to
release software faster are a

761
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,530
differentiator as a fundamental

762
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,130
differentiator in that industry.

763
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,080
Kaltura, this was a fun one.

764
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,820
So we onboarded with them,

765
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,747
we took a look at their OTel config

766
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,910
and we said, Hey, this is inefficient.

767
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,900
We didn't have to, it would've

768
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,830
worked, it would've been fine.

769
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,790
We would've got it working.

770
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,980
It made no difference
to how Coralogix worked.

771
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,977
And we spent a few days with
them just rewriting their OTel

772
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,480
config and it saved them 25%

773
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,830
of their telemetry infrastructure.

774
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,120
They're sending us 14 terabytes

775
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,604
of data that's about to go up.

776
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,960
So 14 terabytes of

777
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,690
of data processing architecture
is actually a reasonably

778
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,674
significant amount of money
that they just saved just

779
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,680
by working with OTel.

780
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,420
Just because we figured
we're at level one.

781
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,490
We have to get this right
because this is a foundation

782
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,020
for all the way through level four.

783
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,340
If we were only thinking about level one

784
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,870
and two, we might just, it's fine,

785
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,430
it's a bit janky, it'll work.

786
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,930
But we knew we weren't
where we wanna get to.

787
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,610
We knew what the north star vision is

788
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,560
and we know it needs to
be really squeaky clean

789
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,393
at the start,

790
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,073
otherwise it's gonna be
very difficult to get there.

791
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,910
And they had a five nines uptime
target, which is, is hard.

792
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,340
That's five nines is I think
AWS is four nines, right?

793
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,811
So it's like, it's pretty intense.

794
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:01,680
And yeah, 25% reduction,
all the infras spend,

795
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,592
that's fin ops right there.

796
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:06,843
So what does all this mean?
What can we take from all this?

797
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,560
What we're doing at Coralogix
is we're taking a typical

798
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,130
model of engagement, which is

799
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,540
we help you solve problems as they arise.

800
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,070
And we're saying, okay,
we're gonna partner with you.

801
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,200
Find out what, not just
your technical goals are,

802
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,490
but your business goals

803
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,973
and how can we turn an
observability platform from a dev

804
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:26,610
tool basically to something
that spans your entire company

805
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,710
and has a massive impact across everybody.

806
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,004
And we're gonna do it with
the same kinds of things

807
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,510
that power great dev tools, great APM,

808
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,050
great real user monitoring,
great sim, great AI based query,

809
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,350
great AI agentic experience
in the forms of Olly.

810
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,020
These things impact across
our entire business.

811
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,730
And that the direction of travel is very

812
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,020
clear in that regard.

813
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,955
Notice every single observability vendor,

814
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,948
they're all talking about
things like intelligence,

815
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:53,345
not talking about a few years
ago it was like catch bugs,

816
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,720
and now it's not that anymore.

817
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,460
It's now it's about business
intelligence, now it's about

818
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,663
finding problems before they happen

819
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,120
and not just in that context,

820
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,130
but constantly, constantly

821
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,020
improving even when there are no problems.

822
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,460
So we're moving past the point
of, let's say, responding

823
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,920
to issues and we're even
moving past the point

824
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,680
of being proactive and catching
issues before they come up.

825
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,540
Now we're just going mining for stuff.

826
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,150
The data is there, the insights are there.

827
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,297
It just needs a bit of massaging

828
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:20,610
and a platform that can
do all that in one place.

829
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,040
Coralogix has been built
for this exact problem

830
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,970
from day one.

831
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,881
The architecture, everything
has been the same since 2019.

832
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:29,414
We started thinking about
this stuff a long time ago

833
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:31,710
and through thousands of
interactions with thousands

834
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,126
of customers, this is the north
star vision we've produced.

835
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,270
Thank you very much for
your time today guys.

836
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,103
I really appreciate it.

837
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,723
I'm gonna hang around some
questions if you're interested,

838
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:40,920
but I really appreciate the time today

839
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,170
and as the slide says, thank you.

840
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,793
Cheers guys.
