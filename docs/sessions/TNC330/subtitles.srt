1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,149
So

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,559
We are here in the last session of the day

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:05,519
in the states

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,828
and we are going to talk about a

5
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:10,739
subject that I think it was very recurring

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,259
during the whole year for you guys. For

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,310
me it was.

8
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:17,260
We are going to talk about agentic

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,019
assistance.

10
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,420
But

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,019
energetic system is not a

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,739
simple solution that requires

13
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,739
a knowledge basis, a

14
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,298
model, and we would

15
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:30,079
simply

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,689
answer questions.

17
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,859
We are thinking about a more sophisticated

18
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:36,598
system.

19
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,298
Think about an approach where we are

20
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,259
treating our agenttic system

21
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,228
like a microservices architecture.

22
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,819
So in this session we are going to talk

23
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:48,418
about agent core.

24
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:52,168
My name is Marilia Brito. I'm a senior

25
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:54,469
technical instructor and leader

26
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,548
of the instructors in Brazil, Sao

27
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:57,250
Paulo.

28
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:59,990
So this is our agenda. We're

29
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,590
going to check every single component

30
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,808
of this modular architecture

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,250
that Agent Core has.

32
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,888
But

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,370
let's start simple, right?

34
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:14,558
First, we have the elements

35
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:15,338
to build

36
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:17,219
this gigantic system.

37
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,290
We have the goals and instructions, so

38
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,730
we have to perform something in this system.

39
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:24,888
And also the tools.

40
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,969
The tools are able to reach internal

41
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:30,120
and external systems.

42
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:32,689
The tool can be a little bit of function,

43
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,569
why not? Or it can be an external

44
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,730
API as well. It depends on

45
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,430
our business necessities.

46
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,870
We have also here

47
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,370
an important thing of a

48
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,028
system, of any system,

49
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,629
the observability.

50
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,000
We must understand how

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,058
our components are working

52
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,338
individually and together

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,278
and how the agency is behaving.

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,010
So

55
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,799
what's happening during the

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,778
reasoning loops?

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,269
What's happening when we call a

58
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:06,260
different tool?

59
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:08,099
Is this the correct tool?

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,558
So we are only going to know about it

61
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:12,368
if we have monitoring, OK.

62
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,520
But

63
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,610
Let me ask you a question.

64
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,669
How many of you built an agentic

65
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,830
system working with any, it

66
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,338
doesn't matter the framework, with any framework

67
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,508
from end to end in

68
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:29,889
this last year?

69
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,210
Oh,

70
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:35,360
We have a few a few people over here,

71
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,979
but I have a different question right

72
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:39,460
now. Was it easy?

73
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,990
To manage the components,

74
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,699
was it or not?

75
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:44,949
No,

76
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,300
it's not easy

77
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:47,460
because

78
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,860
in this microservice architecture,

79
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:53,520
well, the premises is simple. We

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,659
have a distributed system,

81
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,000
so we have many components to

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,278
take to take care

83
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:01,750
and sometimes we don't have the

84
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,699
purpose-built solution

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,258
to work with this,

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,699
so.

87
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,899
We must think about infrastructure.

88
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,580
We must think about.

89
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:15,429
We must think about

90
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,538
maybe more than one model

91
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:19,860
for a specific purpose.

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,399
And sometimes people tend to think

93
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,558
that I'm going to work with

94
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:26,868
the biggest model that

95
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:27,774
Ever existed

96
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,594
with billions of parameters and

97
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:32,993
this will be enough for me, but actually

98
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:35,344
this doesn't matter. What matters is

99
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,474
to structure your architecture with

100
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,594
the modular components that will

101
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,713
be configured according to your

102
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,875
needs. So that's why we are going to

103
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,594
talk about Agent Core.

104
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:48,169
Agentco is the managed and

105
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,778
purpose-built service focused on

106
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:53,429
bringing all the magic that we

107
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:55,550
have in identity system

108
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,210
to a place where we are going to

109
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,588
think about this modular architecture

110
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:04,278
piece by piece, configuring

111
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,189
according to our needs

112
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,088
and

113
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,740
Firstly, we can think that, oh,

114
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,719
but this is too much complexity.

115
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,058
No, it's much simpler

116
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,960
than you can, you are thinking.

117
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,369
On Agent's car,

118
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,048
we have these modules.

119
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,338
So the first module, the runtime,

120
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,528
will take care about the execution

121
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,470
environment and working with isolated

122
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,769
sessions.

123
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,259
After that,

124
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,548
we have the agent's core

125
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,629
gateway. The gateway will

126
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,629
expose the tools, even if

127
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,129
the tools are internal.

128
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,528
But

129
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,079
we don't want to provide

130
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,660
a full access to every

131
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,488
single tool,

132
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,449
so we have the agent's core identity

133
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,738
to take care about the authentication

134
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:54,879
and the authorization

135
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,500
of the actions that the

136
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,100
agent is going to perform.

137
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:03,088
Observability because we said that monitoring

138
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:05,149
is very important and it is.

139
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:06,389
And also

140
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,730
memory, so we can work

141
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,298
with context.

142
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,108
And now we are going to explore

143
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,108
every single component

144
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:16,730
here.

145
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,608
And also on Monday,

146
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,088
there was a few launches about

147
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:22,778
Agent Core,

148
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,389
and I tried to incorporate a

149
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,588
little bit of this,

150
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:29,949
of the launches in this presentation.

151
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,230
OK, I woke up today at 5:30

152
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,470
to insert this news, so

153
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,290
I hope you enjoy it.

154
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,829
Let's start with run time.

155
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,720
The run time is the component

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,798
where the

157
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,970
The reasoning loop

158
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:47,399
will occur.

159
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,670
So here we have a standardized

160
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,709
execution environment that

161
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,569
is isolated for each session.

162
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,069
So one session is not able to

163
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,488
check the other session,

164
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:00,858
um,

165
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,230
even using the same agent,

166
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,149
OK.

167
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,470
And the magical thing

168
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:08,189
about the run time

169
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,369
is that,

170
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,750
OK, I know everybody

171
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,899
has their, has their favorite

172
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,449
model.

173
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,488
Everybody has their favorite

174
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,470
framework, and it's OK. I have

175
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,309
mine too,

176
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,009
but for a runtime

177
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:23,170
it doesn't matter.

178
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,988
You can choose whatever open source framework

179
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,069
you want. So if you want to work with

180
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,139
strengths, it's OK. Crew

181
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,509
AI, Leama Index, Long chain.

182
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,869
It will,

183
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,790
it will work in the same way.

184
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,410
You can also bring models from Amazon

185
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,889
Bedrock, Amazonage maker AI,

186
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,949
and external models.

187
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:46,298
So.

188
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,358
We have.

189
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,488
We have a clear use case dependency

190
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,910
here and we have a model

191
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,660
and framework

192
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,269
flexibility

193
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,269
as well,

194
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:03,119
so it doesn't matter if you have a simple

195
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,209
workflow. I just have

196
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,350
to check a knowledge base,

197
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,928
a calculation tool, and that's

198
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:11,470
it.

199
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,670
Run time can handle this.

200
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,509
I have to work with 100

201
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:17,129
tools.

202
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,829
I have to access 30

203
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,858
different knowledge bases. It's

204
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,988
OK. It will work at the same

205
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:28,129
time. How

206
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,338
can we configure

207
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,750
the runtime?

208
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,290
First, for our recipe, we need

209
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,670
the model and also the framework.

210
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,000
After that,

211
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:40,199
we have the runtime decorator,

212
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:43,608
and the runtime decorator defines

213
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,028
how the runtime.

214
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:49,829
how the run time should execute

215
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:50,709
the agent

216
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,129
and the tools.

217
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,649
The second element here is the identity

218
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:56,798
configuration,

219
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,139
and the identity configuration will

220
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,259
be part of a different model that

221
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,639
we are going to see next,

222
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,519
but it will define

223
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,678
authorization here.

224
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:09,298
So which actions are

225
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,379
we going to be able to perform in the

226
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:11,980
session?

227
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,459
And the observability configuration.

228
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,420
So

229
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,119
which metrics are we going to

230
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,559
use to check our system

231
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,759
uh configability and also

232
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,959
if it is performing in the way that we are

233
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,879
expecting. We

234
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,699
are going to package this

235
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,239
using Docker.

236
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,500
And after that, the docker image

237
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
will be registered in the

238
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,058
ECR in the Elastic container

239
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,000
registry.

240
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:44,038
After that,

241
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:45,788
we are going to launch

242
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:48,327
our execution environment. So

243
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,508
when there is a need to call an agent,

244
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:53,207
the execution environment will be launched,

245
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,808
and we have the runtime agent,

246
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,467
so where the reasoning is going to happen

247
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,788
and the runtime end point.

248
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:03,788
We have a different element that we are going to talk

249
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,149
about. The name is gateway, but

250
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,168
this is how the gateway is going to

251
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:08,889
connect

252
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:10,969
to the runtime,

253
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:11,928
OK?

254
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,119
But

255
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:16,469
Let's pretend that we already

256
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,599
started our run time. Let's talk

257
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,779
about the life cycle.

258
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,889
In the life cycle of the run time

259
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:24,529
first.

260
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,940
The session is activist. So we are performing

261
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,599
actions.

262
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,229
We are using tools,

263
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,658
we are performing reasoning, we are checking the

264
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:33,918
knowledge bases,

265
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,330
the, the system is observing,

266
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,168
OK?

267
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,580
So we are working with something

268
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,989
here. But after

269
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:43,908
a task

270
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:45,109
is finished,

271
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,070
The session will turn to an

272
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,320
idle stage.

273
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,879
And the idle stage

274
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,000
for the fall,

275
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,798
it stays up to

276
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,219
15 minutes, but idle, it's OK,

277
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,259
it's waiting for a new task.

278
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,330
But if nothing happens in

279
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,788
these 15 minutes,

280
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,668
the session will be terminated.

281
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:07,808
But

282
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,090
what if 15 minutes

283
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,158
of waiting is not enough for us?

284
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,190
We want to maintain the environment

285
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:16,330
warm.

286
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,710
We don't want to start a cold

287
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,450
session.

288
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,119
So in this case,

289
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,769
we can extend the maximum session

290
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,769
duration for up to 8

291
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,259
hours, OK. After 8 hours,

292
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,690
the runtime environment will

293
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,769
be terminated.

294
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,418
OK?

295
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,109
So, let's proceed to

296
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:37,619
the identity model.

297
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,960
The identity model

298
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,519
will take care about the authorization

299
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,879
and authentication,

300
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:45,918
and there are

301
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:48,820
333 different ways

302
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,340
that we can work with this component.

303
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,119
So

304
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,099
we can use IAM.

305
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:58,509
We can use also Amazon Cognito

306
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,090
or an external provider

307
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,190
like Octa,

308
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,529
Microsoft, Intra ID.

309
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,418
So in this case, it's a little

310
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,580
bit different how we are going to work

311
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,619
with tokens. Yes,

312
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,359
there are tokens involved.

313
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,879
The identity

314
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,359
We work with two

315
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:21,080
separated sessions, the inbound

316
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,219
and outbound, and we can check

317
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,279
that the inbound is happening,

318
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,918
the authorization is happening

319
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,879
before the solicitation reaches

320
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,668
the agent.

321
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,210
So first of all,

322
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,739
any user, because usually

323
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,840
we are working with users, right?

324
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,288
Users are going to use these agents

325
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,229
to

326
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,058
respond, to have an answer about about

327
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:44,759
something. So in this case,

328
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:45,759
first,

329
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,899
The session

330
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,658
must be authorized on the

331
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:53,019
inbound using IAM

332
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,859
or using the OAuf

333
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,840
for an external provider.

334
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:58,649
After

335
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,609
everything is approved.

336
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,298
The agent is going to start

337
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,859
to check the input,

338
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,440
so the instructions that we sent,

339
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,649
uh, decompose into steps,

340
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,139
and each step is going to be sent

341
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,580
to a different tool.

342
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,119
If the tool is internal,

343
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,599
so a little bit of function, for

344
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,129
instance,

345
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,379
we are going to use the IAM,

346
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,548
the IAM signed before to

347
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:28,658
authorize this kind of

348
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,759
operation. But what if the

349
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,158
tool is external?

350
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,129
In this case,

351
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:36,428
we are going to use uh

352
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:37,369
the OAuf.

353
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:40,408
So we are trying to reach an external

354
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,408
system, it's OK, we are going to

355
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,450
use the OALF.

356
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,129
But what actually

357
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,529
happened in the outbound?

358
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,009
Are we going to use the same tokens that

359
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,889
we received in the inbound?

360
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,048
No, The

361
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:56,908
first token

362
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,678
that is that will be stored

363
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,719
in

364
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:03,330
the next component that we are going to check

365
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:04,908
will be swapped

366
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,928
like a trusted

367
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:08,668
relationship.

368
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,558
So if you were able to

369
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,529
access the agent,

370
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,570
I'm going to use your token,

371
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,090
swap for a new token

372
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,989
to authorize this external

373
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,469
external access.

374
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,379
But in cases that

375
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,119
We started the inbound

376
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,859
with IAM or OAuf,

377
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,469
and in the second part

378
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,700
in the outbound, we are going to use a

379
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,979
different kind of authentication.

380
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,918
What is going to happen? It, it's pretty similar,

381
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,219
but the token is not renewed, it

382
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,440
is not swapped. In this case,

383
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,178
the first token will be used to

384
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:48,700
fetch.

385
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,629
The second token.

386
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,250
So that's how we can

387
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,129
access these external tools.

388
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,099
The next component is the gateway.

389
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,190
So how are we going to expose

390
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,509
the tools?

391
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:05,599
Well,

392
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,788
we can expose the tools, so RIO

393
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,940
APIs, Lambda functions,

394
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,440
or even servers

395
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:14,869
using the gateway.

396
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:16,849
And

397
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,509
there is a few strategies that we

398
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:20,849
can adopt

399
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:22,489
to,

400
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,009
to better, to improve

401
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,950
how these tools are going to be

402
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,908
uh used.

403
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,788
So not just by keywords, OK.

404
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,070
In this case, we can use also

405
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,109
the semantic search to

406
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,788
match the right tool.

407
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,210
So let's explore

408
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,099
the agent core gateway.

409
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,599
It started with the architecture

410
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,058
that we checked before.

411
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,440
So I have a user prompt

412
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,440
reaching the agent.

413
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,590
Uh, we already had

414
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,779
the in Baodo education before it,

415
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,750
and now

416
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,649
the gateway must provide the

417
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,469
access for the tools.

418
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:05,070
OK.

419
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:08,500
Take a look

420
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,538
in that secure talking vault.

421
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:13,418
This is pretty important.

422
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,109
Why are we talking about the identity

423
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:17,739
module?

424
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,519
I'm told that the toks are

425
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,658
stored somewhere.

426
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,279
So this is the A place where the

427
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,119
tokens will be stored.

428
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,820
We don't want to store the tokens

429
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,019
inside the runtime

430
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,719
because the run time we have plenty of things

431
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,639
happening over there.

432
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,158
We want to store this externally

433
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:38,229
so it makes sense to be

434
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,080
inside the gateway.

435
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,298
When we are working with the gateway,

436
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,538
first we have a session ID

437
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,739
that is provided by

438
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:47,960
the runtime.

439
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,070
And this session ID will

440
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,009
be binded

441
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:54,590
with a workload ID.

442
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,859
So what the what the agent

443
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,369
is going to perform here,

444
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,298
OK, we have these two ideas

445
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:04,678
that we are going to check after

446
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,859
in the observability module.

447
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,950
So in this case,

448
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,489
it's providing the safe access

449
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,908
um.

450
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,408
I'm not going to say it's the standard

451
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,330
practice to work with MCP

452
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,918
for external tools. You can use

453
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,469
lambda function as well

454
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,070
to access an external API,

455
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:25,989
but

456
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,729
I must say that MCP during

457
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:31,750
my customers' conversation is

458
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:33,960
the king of popularity,

459
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,418
right? So

460
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:38,940
here we have the access for the external

461
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,460
tools.

462
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:42,700
This is new.

463
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,719
This was launched Monday.

464
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,690
In the identity configuration,

465
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,320
yes, we have security over there.

466
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,869
We are checking

467
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,288
if someone can assume

468
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:55,808
accession.

469
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,820
Inside an agent and to start the runtime.

470
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,769
But with this new capability, the

471
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:03,820
policy and agent core that is still

472
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,910
in preview, OK, it's pretty fresh.

473
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,660
We can work with more

474
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,410
detail, more,

475
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,578
more granularity.

476
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,880
In our policies.

477
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,670
You can write the policy using

478
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,029
natural language, in this case in English,

479
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:20,920
OK,

480
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,519
but if you rather, you can

481
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,828
use the Cedar language

482
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,989
as well to structure this

483
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:28,588
policy.

484
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:30,549
So here

485
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:32,789
Um,

486
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,608
here I'm going to think about the

487
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:37,949
tools that are going to be accessed

488
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:39,848
by the

489
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,189
Through

490
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:42,049
the gateway.

491
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,239
OK.

492
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,750
If you want to know more

493
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:47,358
about these capabilities,

494
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,769
there is a blog post

495
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,868
from Danilo

496
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,890
Danilo Poncea or is Daniel, I think

497
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,068
it's Danilo Poncecia,

498
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:56,420
um.

499
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,279
And there is this one and 4

500
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,078
more launches.

501
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,459
OK, I don't have the QR code. I'm sorry,

502
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,160
but I think that you find very easily.

503
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,500
I have a quick demo

504
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,039
about the gateway.

505
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,180
So it's the coding

506
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,739
from a workshop

507
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:16,979
where we have the creation

508
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,368
of the gateway,

509
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,059
so providing the name

510
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,400
and the description.

511
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,959
I'm going to use a semantic.

512
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,239
Module so to find the correct tools,

513
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,229
in this case.

514
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,269
OK. After that, there is the

515
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,789
creation of the gateway.

516
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,809
And I'm going to use a

517
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,318
key. This is the end.

518
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:49,130
Amazon research name the protocol.

519
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,420
Now we are going to add the target

520
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,559
in the gateway.

521
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:01,068
So we have to pass the gateway ID,

522
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,848
the name of the target,

523
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,709
the target description.

524
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:07,489
A little bit of function in this case that I'm

525
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:08,348
going to use.

526
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:13,959
OK.

527
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,618
And for authentication, I'm working

528
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:18,660
with Cognito.

529
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,568
This is the architecture that we already checked

530
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,529
on the east light.

531
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,459
So we have lambda functions here

532
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,459
and we also have external.

533
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,650
But in this demo, I'm going to focus more on

534
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,568
the Lambda function.

535
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,368
OK. The gateway was

536
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:40,088
created.

537
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,699
And now we are going to add the targets.

538
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,568
So first we have a little bit of function

539
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:49,630
that we handle with restaurant

540
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,848
reservations.

541
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,838
And also a calculator.

542
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:00,890
A different function with a calculator.

543
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,549
But just to show that we can add

544
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:06,449
more tools.

545
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:08,959
So

546
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,759
up to 1000 tools per target,

547
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm adding more calculators over

548
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,890
here. I'm

549
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,930
actually duplicated, but we are going to

550
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,130
interpret it as mortals.

551
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:28,328
OK.

552
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:30,930
And after that, we are going to print.

553
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,170
And show that the tools were added.

554
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,118
I swear it works.

555
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,108
Perfect. And then we are going to list

556
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:49,410
the tools.

557
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:57,318
And

558
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,529
It's done.

559
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,848
So up to 100 targets

560
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:04,449
per gateway and up to 1000

561
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:05,608
tools, OK.

562
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:10,509
Let's take a different model

563
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,670
now, the memory model.

564
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,289
It's very important to think about

565
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,469
the memory because we don't want to repeat

566
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:18,868
every single

567
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,269
word in every single interaction

568
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,670
with an agent. It's pretty boring,

569
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,809
right? It's like to

570
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:26,430
talk

571
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:27,969
with a goldfish.

572
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,289
So an agent without memory is like

573
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,910
a goldfish. It will forget

574
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:34,229
what you said 3 seconds before.

575
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,039
This is a little bit exaggerated, I know,

576
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,229
but it, it's

577
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:40,289
almost the same case.

578
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,459
So here,

579
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:44,229
we have a person asking about

580
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:45,479
how to switch apps

581
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:46,838
on her, on the phone.

582
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,930
We have the answers. So

583
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,289
what model are you using and the model?

584
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:55,549
OK, we have an answer how to switch

585
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:56,229
the apps.

586
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,259
2 days

587
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,500
before this,

588
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,078
how do I take a screenshot of my

589
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:04,239
phone? Oh, what's the mode?

590
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,660
We have to explain everything.

591
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,598
So we don't want to have this kind of

592
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:11,640
problem. Our customers are

593
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,019
not going to be happy

594
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,959
to repeat every single thing again.

595
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,279
There are 2 kinds,

596
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,199
actually, now there are 3

597
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,309
kinds of memory managing

598
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:24,368
on agent court.

599
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:28,170
The first one is the short-term

600
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,430
memory, so the memory that we

601
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,910
are going to use during a session.

602
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:34,299
OK.

603
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,709
So here we have 3

604
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:37,799
components.

605
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,229
So the first one, the events

606
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,689
are the records of a single

607
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:44,769
interaction with the user

608
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,420
and the agents, OK.

609
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:47,828
So,

610
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,410
we can have the two actions, we

611
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,489
can have the assistant and also

612
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,729
the user messages included here.

613
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,838
We can start this one by

614
00:22:57,838 --> 00:22:59,920
one or in batches. It depends

615
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,989
on the volume of the

616
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,059
conversation. The actors,

617
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:06,400
so which users and which

618
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,959
agents are included in this

619
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,868
conversation. And

620
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:12,189
the session.

621
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,689
So, in which period

622
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,750
we had this conversation.

623
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,739
Here is a small example.

624
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,219
But it happened in the same day, so it's

625
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:27,380
not the same case that we are talking

626
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,930
about in the first slide of this component,

627
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,559
OK. Sorry.

628
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,259
So let's check now the long

629
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,689
term memory.

630
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,509
In the long-term memory, I'm going

631
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,680
to, I'm going to talk a little

632
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,689
bit about summary, user preference,

633
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:46,479
semantic,

634
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:49,568
but there is a new capability,

635
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:50,420
OK?

636
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,368
This new capability helps

637
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:54,209
the agent.

638
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,719
Actually help help the agent in the memory

639
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,098
to learn more about how

640
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,000
are you communicating

641
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,650
with your agent.

642
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,259
So. What's the

643
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:06,979
tone

644
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,880
that this customer is using?

645
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,930
What is, what are, what are the

646
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,500
subjects

647
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:14,890
that this customer is interested in?

648
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,029
What about the details

649
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,410
about the subject?

650
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,650
So in this case,

651
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:23,309
we are going to use

652
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:24,250
to collect

653
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,068
this kind of information for a better

654
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:27,769
experience,

655
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:30,068
OK? But let's check the

656
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,328
other components,

657
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,029
the user preference.

658
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,598
So here we, here we have a different

659
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:38,029
conversation. So I like

660
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:40,618
this this brand of headphones.

661
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,269
My company gives me 25%

662
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:44,068
for the item,

663
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:46,969
and I prefer white open

664
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,430
ear headphones.

665
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,348
White?

666
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,150
No, it gets dirty.

667
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,489
OK.

668
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:56,140
This conversation, this session is

669
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,088
stored in the memory

670
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,588
and now we have the preference of these

671
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:02,660
users. So it depends on the

672
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,709
context, it depends on the interactions

673
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,229
that you want to store.

674
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,289
If you have, uh,

675
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,910
if you're selling electronics, this

676
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,009
makes no sense.

677
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,279
OK.

678
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,250
So, we are storing the color,

679
00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:18,348
the brand and the model.

680
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:20,930
Four days.

681
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,410
So 4 days after that in June

682
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,789
5th, I want,

683
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:27,650
I want new headphones. It's time

684
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,150
to change the old ones

685
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:32,449
and the agent will be smart enough to to

686
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,509
fetch the previous information

687
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,529
and include.

688
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,088
In this conversation, even with the 25%

689
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:39,799
of discount.

690
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:44,108
Semantic

691
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,000
Um

692
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:50,140
We are not going to store

693
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,259
every single sentence in any

694
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,000
case that we are checking here.

695
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,039
So in semantics, we are choosing,

696
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:59,670
not us, but the model is choosing

697
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,019
the most important information

698
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,059
of this conversation. So a

699
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:04,799
summary,

700
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,900
OK. This

701
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,299
person is pretty hard to

702
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,459
make this person happy,

703
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,259
right, so.

704
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,500
Now this person wants to return

705
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,939
the headphones that I bought last week

706
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:20,000
because

707
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,680
found $100 cheaper

708
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,500
elsewhere,

709
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,170
but our agent is pretty

710
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,559
smart, so we will help this customer

711
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,318
to pay less, so we'll refund

712
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:34,539
$100 in difference. I really

713
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:35,539
like this agent.

714
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:40,769
Summary

715
00:26:42,858 --> 00:26:43,439
Well,

716
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:46,118
In this case,

717
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,729
We have just a summarization. I told you

718
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,729
that we don't have all the lines of a

719
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:52,239
chat,

720
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:55,049
just the preference or the semantics

721
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,068
or what is similar,

722
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:58,130
and here the summary.

723
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,078
The person broke the phones.

724
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:06,348
So now, I broke the phones,

725
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,779
um,

726
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,189
and now the agent is going to

727
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:12,318
happen maybe to fix it or maybe to

728
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:13,338
send the customer

729
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,818
for some kind of shop

730
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:17,259
that they can fix

731
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,858
this, these headphones,

732
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,680
OK? About

733
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,299
the memory

734
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,959
The default storage of the memory

735
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,939
is 7 days,

736
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,719
but you can store the memory up

737
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,858
to 1 year.

738
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:32,750
OK.

739
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:33,890
A lot of time.

740
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,449
Sometimes we don't remember what we said one year

741
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:37,989
ago, right?

742
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,279
Now let's check the browser.

743
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:45,618
The browser module, we are going

744
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:46,318
to use,

745
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:47,920
it's correct,

746
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:50,338
we are going to use when there is a need

747
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,739
to access a web interface,

748
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:55,479
so a website that we must

749
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,979
search for something.

750
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,680
So in this case,

751
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:02,739
we can use also the security

752
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,219
controls of the VPC.

753
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,029
We have um

754
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:08,969
a a micro VM

755
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,660
that we are going to work for this kind of

756
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,608
operations. Actually,

757
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,068
almost everything on Agent Core,

758
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,469
we are going to use a micro VM, but

759
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:19,549
it's services, so we don't have to

760
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:20,608
worry about

761
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,989
the size of the instance or

762
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:25,789
even the scalability configurations.

763
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:27,868
This is built in in the servicing.

764
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:31,098
But in this case we can control

765
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:33,160
the network level

766
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,400
security using the Amazon VPC.

767
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:38,439
So

768
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,489
What happens when we use the browser?

769
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:43,338
First,

770
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,739
there is the user. Oh, I want to

771
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:47,279
buy new shoes.

772
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:50,368
Me too. Send

773
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:51,670
this to the agent

774
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,289
and the agent will invoke the model,

775
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:54,989
but

776
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,598
the model is not responsible

777
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:58,630
to access

778
00:28:59,049 --> 00:28:59,608
the site.

779
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,699
The browser is going to access

780
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,279
the site.

781
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,368
So in this case, we are going to use

782
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:09,209
a computer to call indicating

783
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,489
what, what actions need to be

784
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:12,900
performed in this browser.

785
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,348
So here it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple,

786
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:17,489
right? We are going to click using

787
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,769
the left button and we have also

788
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:20,729
the position

789
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,088
to click in the screen.

790
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,979
This will be translated to CDP

791
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,799
comments and we are going to use

792
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,180
the browser as a headless

793
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,880
browser,

794
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:31,809
so

795
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:34,318
similar to Selenium, but we're going to

796
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:35,660
use a Playwright

797
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:36,680
browser.

798
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,219
And then

799
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:41,779
we had a screenshot, and this was

800
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,509
returned to our customer.

801
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:45,680
But

802
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:47,868
I have this in more details.

803
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,239
How do we work

804
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:50,880
with the browser?

805
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:52,838
First, in this example,

806
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,588
We have a situation where

807
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,279
I asked to search

808
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,219
on Amazon for a MacBook.

809
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,969
List

810
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:05,699
The options and return

811
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:08,019
the description of the first

812
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,689
option. OK?

813
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,328
So first here we are starting

814
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,289
with the imports that are necessary,

815
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:18,059
OK, so the browser on Agent Core,

816
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,750
Jason and another different kinds

817
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,689
of imports,

818
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,868
but to open.

819
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,699
Our flow

820
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,559
I'm going to use this Nova

821
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,059
act. The

822
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:34,059
Nova Act is an action

823
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,420
dialect that will translate

824
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,608
the actions that need to be performed

825
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:39,459
by the browser.

826
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:42,130
OK, so,

827
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:43,949
and to click,

828
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,309
to copy, to type, to

829
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:47,549
take a screenshot.

830
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,969
So here we are starting

831
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,269
the session

832
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,189
and also I want to see what

833
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:56,189
the browser is doing. Yeah, we can

834
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,189
check. So we're going to use

835
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,170
a DCV SDK

836
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:01,309
as well

837
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,140
to live stream what is happening

838
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:06,509
in the browser for us in a local

839
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,549
server using the Port 8000.

840
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:13,588
And this session is also isolated.

841
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:15,900
We are going to work with signed

842
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,989
URLs to perform this kind

843
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:18,930
of access.

844
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,410
There is also the configuration about the

845
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,868
user interface

846
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,410
that we can see in the live browser.

847
00:31:30,328 --> 00:31:30,989
OK,

848
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,489
and the actions that are

849
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:34,309
going to be

850
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:35,709
performed.

851
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:38,289
So we are going to use the playwright

852
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:40,568
with the Nova act. I need an API

853
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,400
key. Um,

854
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,459
And this is also part of

855
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,019
the layout that we are going to see.

856
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,789
Now we are starting

857
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:55,368
the viewer session.

858
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,769
Generating the pre-sign

859
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,598
URL,

860
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:01,949
OK, and it's a temporary access when

861
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:03,828
we work with pre-sign URL

862
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,479
there is a token that it will be used.

863
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,689
Starting the session of the new

864
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:12,509
browser using the Amazon.com.

865
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:15,709
Site, we have also the instructions

866
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:16,449
over there

867
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,568
and

868
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,729
part of the reasoning. So

869
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:22,630
I am on the Amazon page, my task

870
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,630
is to search for MacBooks and

871
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,910
extract the details of the first

872
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:31,400
one. This

873
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,160
is the page.

874
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,539
I thought it was a video.

875
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,239
But this is the page after

876
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,900
the first one has been chosen, who

877
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,838
has been selected. This information,

878
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,598
so from Apple to Midnight

879
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:49,259
is what we are going to collect. So the

880
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,078
description of the product.

881
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,789
And as we can see here

882
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:57,170
in the first box,

883
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,289
that's what we collected.

884
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,680
OK. There is also the execution

885
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,509
metrics,

886
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,108
um,

887
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,809
so the prompt that were used, the

888
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,250
number of steps that were executed

889
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:10,890
in the site.

890
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,088
So first,

891
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:14,318
We open the site,

892
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:15,910
type it,

893
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:18,400
list it and copy

894
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,838
the first item.

895
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:21,078
OK.

896
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:23,509
So this is the browser,

897
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:26,180
er, secure sandbox so we can

898
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,900
perform external actions in web

899
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,420
websites.

900
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,750
One more.

901
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:34,750
The code interpreter.

902
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,299
We can say that browser and code

903
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,799
interpreter are tools as well.

904
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,019
The code interpreter is to run

905
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,118
your code, so to execute your code

906
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,578
also in an isolated

907
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:50,920
environment, serverless environment using

908
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,000
a micro VM. This, this is, this

909
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,459
is not going to change,

910
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,489
OK.

911
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,239
We can use

912
00:33:57,838 --> 00:33:58,640
JavaScript,

913
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,000
TypeScript, and Python

914
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,640
for these executions, and there are two

915
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,019
ways to work with that.

916
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,989
The first is the system code

917
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,010
interpreter.

918
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,628
In this case, we are going to use the built-in

919
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:14,469
libraries and all the built-in configurations

920
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,829
to execute a simple code that

921
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,869
is not required to import

922
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:21,590
a specific library, so custom libraries,

923
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,519
OK.

924
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,989
So the agent

925
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:25,449
receives

926
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,188
the instruction.

927
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:30,309
Decides that it is necessary to call

928
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,070
the code interpreter,

929
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,610
then the session will be mapped

930
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,969
to a specific VM used only

931
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,728
for this case, for this session.

932
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,858
We have also a terminal over there

933
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:44,197
and a file system. This file

934
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,418
system is ephemeral, so after

935
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,588
the execution, it will be terminated.

936
00:34:50,228 --> 00:34:52,389
And then we have the

937
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,708
result of the execution being returned

938
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:55,469
to the agent.

939
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,688
But if I need a higher degree

940
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:00,128
of customization,

941
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,949
there is a custom code interpreter.

942
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,969
So in this case, you are going to package

943
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:07,349
the requirements

944
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,909
to use in this ecosystem,

945
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,389
OK. You, you package all

946
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:13,519
the dependencies.

947
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,269
In our

948
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,889
last module, a bunch of modules,

949
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:23,050
right? But this is good because we can

950
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,809
configure with a higher degree of

951
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:26,869
granularity,

952
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:28,688
the observability.

953
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:32,659
So in the observability,

954
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,050
we have a full enterprise

955
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,510
visualization. It's compatible

956
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,550
to open telemetry, so

957
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,909
you can check your metrics

958
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,739
outside the service if you want,

959
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,449
or you can check inside the cloud watch

960
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,289
as well.

961
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:48,929
So we can see

962
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,688
tool use, agent actions

963
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,429
using detailed traces, and

964
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:56,619
there are 3 different visions

965
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,949
that will be provided.

966
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:01,550
The first vision in the Gen AI

967
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,250
observability dashboard, I'm inside the cloudwatch

968
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,489
system right now.

969
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,289
We can see.

970
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,329
Almost as needed.

971
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,800
We can see how many agents

972
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,878
were instrumentalized so we can

973
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:18,878
check the metrics.

974
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,500
So just a vision about the agents

975
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,800
and the sessions that are active and the

976
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,418
traces that we collected.

977
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,050
The second vision that we have here.

978
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,349
Is the agent specific metrics,

979
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,449
so how many sessions

980
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,449
per agent,

981
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:39,329
also the consumer, the tokens,

982
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,469
the latency.

983
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,239
So we can see how the agent is

984
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:44,929
performing,

985
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,918
but what if, what if we need more granularity?

986
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,958
In this case, we can check a

987
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,449
specific session

988
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,958
that was that ran in

989
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:55,800
the run time.

990
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,269
OK.

991
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,949
I can check the traces

992
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:01,469
as well.

993
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,070
Here we only have 3 traces,

994
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,590
so it was a very small

995
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:07,809
execution.

996
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:10,688
But there is something new over

997
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,469
here as well.

998
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,389
And this is pretty amazing

999
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:17,168
because

1000
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:19,590
we were talking about latency,

1001
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,469
how the agent is performing,

1002
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,989
but what about the quality of

1003
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:25,090
the answers?

1004
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,250
Now we can see with agent core

1005
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,309
evaluations.

1006
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,110
It is still in preview,

1007
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,909
but we can check metrics like

1008
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,199
accuracy,

1009
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:38,519
helpfulness, faithfulness, harmless,

1010
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:40,050
and stereotyping.

1011
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,909
But sometimes these metrics are not enough,

1012
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:44,188
but it's OK.

1013
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:46,878
You can work out with custom metrics,

1014
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,929
you have to detail

1015
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,929
describe the metric and also

1016
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:54,168
provide a hacking system. It

1017
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:56,250
can be numerical or it can be

1018
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,929
also personalized,

1019
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,030
OK,

1020
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,070
um,

1021
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:02,369
for those who already worked with

1022
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:04,840
Bedrock, um, evaluations,

1023
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,389
the interface,

1024
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,449
it looks like almost the same.

1025
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,628
OK,

1026
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,889
but

1027
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,389
in this case, where we are working

1028
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,610
with the built-in metrics, sorry I

1029
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,688
said accuracy, but I, I was

1030
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:20,070
trying to say faithfulness.

1031
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:23,239
But in this case, we are working with

1032
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,659
a programmatic evaluation,

1033
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:26,760
OK?

1034
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,019
When we are talking about custom

1035
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,019
metrics, we are going to use an

1036
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,159
LLM as a judge, so

1037
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,398
almost the same way that we work

1038
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:38,099
outside Agent core.

1039
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,860
So I hope you like it,

1040
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:44,688
our tour on the components

1041
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:45,820
of Agents car,

1042
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,398
and the main thing here is

1043
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:50,438
that now we can work with

1044
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:52,579
a higher degree of customization.

1045
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,958
We can use whatever model

1046
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,039
fits you best. We can use any

1047
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,059
framework that your team

1048
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,360
or even you, why not? You can work in

1049
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,099
your personal project.

1050
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,280
It's more user too.

1051
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,458
So if you have any questions, I'll be

1052
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,639
available next to the stage,

1053
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,570
and I hope you enjoy it. We have

1054
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,489
a little bit of slides here,

1055
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,510
so the developers community,

1056
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,208
but today is the last day

1057
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:22,489
for the expo. You have to run

1058
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,590
to reach the other hotel, to reach Venetia.

1059
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:27,280
Um

1060
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,878
During the event we had several activations

1061
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:33,760
from training certification with the gamification

1062
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
team, the amazing gamification

1063
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,139
team. Also, if you

1064
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:40,219
want to know more about the cloud, you want

1065
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:41,739
to know more about the agents,

1066
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:44,280
you can find this by free

1067
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:47,418
inside the SkillBuilder platform. So

1068
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,659
more than 1000 trainings

1069
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:50,208
for you

1070
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:51,099
to get,

1071
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:52,719
to gain more knowledge.

1072
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,469
Here we have also training paths

1073
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:00,208
to gain more more experience in

1074
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,688
specific areas.

1075
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:03,699
And

1076
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,250
I want to see everybody here with certifications.

1077
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,458
I'm a golden jacket myself. I want to

1078
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,019
see everybody to become a golden jacket

1079
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,079
too. And

1080
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,320
I want to say thank you so much for

1081
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,378
being here in the last session,

1082
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,719
and I hope you had an amazing event.
