  "abstract": "Credit unions and insurance organizations can leverage AI agents for automating complex workflows. In this code talk we’ll demonstrate going from concept to production with spec-driven development. We’ll work backwards from your business processes such as lending automation, claims processing, and fraud detection to turn prompts into detailed specifications, code, documents, and tests. Using prompts as code, we'll build production-ready agents using Strands Agents SDK and AWS services. Attendees will leave equipped with implementation tools, sample code, and best practices for building and deploying agentic AI solutions that transform credit union and insurance operations while ensuring explainable, compliant AI decision-making.",
