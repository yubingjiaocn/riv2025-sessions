1
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:04,059
Hey, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:07,809
Almost the end of the conference.

3
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:10,648
It's uh how's everyone doing?

4
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,009
Uh, still surviving,

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,960
uh. All

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,019
right, you know, so today in this session, we're gonna talk

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,260
about harness, who harness is, what we do.

8
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,739
Uh, and we have, will, uh, have

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,019
a fireside chat, uh, with Marriott,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,138
one of the customers of Harness, and how Marriott

11
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,280
has transformed their

12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,969
DevOps and their software engineering, uh,

13
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,020
using Harness.

14
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:33,779
So I'll, I'll start with, uh,

15
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,880
you know, uh, introducing Who Harness is,

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,459
uh, our mission in harness that

17
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,658
we have all the developers, software engineers in the world

18
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,728
writing a lot of code, writing much more code now with

19
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,918
AI. How do we enable them to ship

20
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:46,978
all that code very quickly, reliably, uh,

21
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,918
efficiently,

22
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:49,459
uh, and securely.

23
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:52,289
And but if you look at like, you know, what's happening

24
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,750
with AI, it's the biggest, uh,

25
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,609
conversation everywhere in the world of software engineering is AI.

26
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,348
Uh, a lot of the focus is AI on coding,

27
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:01,630
uh, and

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,278
everyone has adopted in one way or another. Uh,

29
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,650
everyone is using it either through your business, you're

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,409
using it personally,

31
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,349
white coding, uh, AI agents for coding,

32
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,579
uh, which is really powerful.

33
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,969
But if you look at these numbers from, uh, from

34
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:16,129
Google's Dora Research,

35
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,760
25% increase in code volume, uh,

36
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:19,489
using AI.

37
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,918
But there is a 7.2%

38
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:23,558
decrease in the in the

39
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,329
in the delivery stability and 1.5%

40
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,459
decrease in the delivery throughput. So why, why

41
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:30,698
is that happening? Like you're writing more code. Everyone

42
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,819
would think, you know, if you write more code, you're

43
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,260
gonna ship much more code, uh,

44
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,579
but that's not really happening. A big part of

45
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,239
that is

46
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,900
coding is not everything, uh, you know,

47
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,558
that you do as software engineering.

48
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,549
The inner loop of software engineering that you spec

49
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,579
something and you write code, that's only the 1st

50
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,698
30-40% of the time that the engineering team will

51
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:50,730
do. Then you give it to the outer loop,

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,019
you know, when it goes out of the developer's laptop, that's

53
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,629
at least 60-70% of the time,

54
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,099
uh, that you spend doing all kinds of things from, you

55
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,558
know, testing, securing, deploying, optimizing.

56
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,620
And if you look at in those buckets, the testing, securing

57
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,439
deploying, optimize,

58
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,819
there's so many workflows you have to do. Like if you

59
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,099
just look at testing, unit testing, integration

60
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,118
testing, load testing, resiliency testing,

61
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,000
API testing, UI testing.

62
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,679
If you look at your security, you

63
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,740
have the code security scans, API security

64
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,689
scans, supply chains scans,

65
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,139
audit approvals, governance approvals.

66
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,835
Checks if you look at what

67
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,754
you have to do for deployment, code deployment,

68
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:29,913
feature flags,

69
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,444
database deployments, infrastructure,

70
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:36,564
infrastructure as code, infrastructure changes, artifact

71
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,585
management, you know, and then you have

72
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,594
to optimize it all the cost of the cloud, cost of

73
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,615
AI, cost of data,

74
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:44,383
you know, cost of your, you know, your teams and processes.

75
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,835
That's where a lot of the software engineering

76
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,493
time goes, 60 to 70% of the time.

77
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,528
You know, you see, you saw all these, you know, workflows

78
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,088
that historically have been a big painful

79
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,129
process for people to do, like, you know,

80
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,710
everything, these 30 plus complex workflows.

81
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:00,778
With AI,

82
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:03,479
the, the code volume is going up. There's 4X

83
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,558
more code volume there, you know, in many companies, you

84
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:07,500
know, you see 20 to 25% pretty often,

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,038
uh, but we're gonna very soon be in at least

86
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:10,838
in 4X.

87
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,240
But if you don't have the downstream outer loop

88
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,088
optimized,

89
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,479
we don't,

90
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,139
we're not going to get the throughput out of it.

91
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,830
And that's where if you look at the testing

92
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,508
processes, a lot of manual steps.

93
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,028
The security is mostly siloed away

94
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,990
from DevOps and the deployment systems.

95
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,429
Deployments are mostly still

96
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:30,429
written through scripting.

97
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,919
People, you take your CI

98
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,990
from the old kind of CIs and

99
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,330
add deployment scripting on top of it

100
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:39,129
and optimization.

101
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,669
A lot of people still have a lot of inefficiencies

102
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,788
you see everywhere from cloud costs, all

103
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,729
kinds of costs that are happening everywhere.

104
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:50,229
That's what Harness is looking to solve.

105
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,808
Harness is a platform for software delivery

106
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:55,300
and bringing AI and automation to the entire software

107
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,028
delivery process.

108
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,550
So Harness is built of many

109
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,669
modules, modules to help you through

110
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,050
all of that process. So you use

111
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,270
AI to help write code better,

112
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,028
code faster,

113
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,028
and be much more efficient in coding.

114
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,460
And harness becomes the automation and AI

115
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,808
solution to help you after that,

116
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,460
which is, you know, increase your velocity, next

117
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,000
generation CICD,

118
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,559
uh, you know, next generation infrastructure as code,

119
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:21,230
uh, database DevOps, artifact registry,

120
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,619
you know, cloud developer environments, all kinds of

121
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,858
things that you need to do to modernize your DevOps

122
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,988
practices that you know, so that you can. Ship the

123
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:28,970
code really, really fast,

124
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:31,649
uh, you know, all the software for

125
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,230
uh for you know for reliability to increase the reliability

126
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,738
whether it's feature flags and future experimentation,

127
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:38,869
uh, chaos engineering, AI SRE,

128
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,869
uh, you know, AI test automation so you can replace

129
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,988
your selenium and playwrights and all those kind of

130
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,059
scripting with with AI agents are

131
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:46,889
doing the testing.

132
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,410
Uh, security work, uh, a lot of the app

133
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,449
security, uh, work that you have to do on

134
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,488
code security scans, API security,

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,798
supply chain security,

136
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,129
and then, you know, uh, optimizing it all, you

137
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,019
know, from your cloud cost, and then you,

138
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:01,449
you have the, uh, the engineering metrics, uh,

139
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,730
you know, to, uh, uh, to understand

140
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,970
where the inefficiencies are,

141
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,569
uh, you know, where, where in your engineering processes,

142
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,809
where the cost inefficiencies are, so

143
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,170
you can, you can, you can increase that.

144
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,488
So harness platform, you know, it's a platform of all of

145
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:14,569
these capabilities our customer.

146
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,994
will normally pick and choose where they want to

147
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,855
start with. Most of our customers

148
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,105
start by modernizing their CICD,

149
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,595
uh, you know, replacing the old CICD system

150
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:25,673
so you can have fully, fully automated process of,

151
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,024
uh, of, you know, code,

152
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:29,184
developer rights code, and every,

153
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:31,673
every, every, every check, every test,

154
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:32,983
every control, every,

155
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,983
uh, you know, check and balance is all fully automated

156
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,355
in the CICD pipelines, you know,

157
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:40,514
then you, then our customers start adding, you know, security

158
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,829
testing, resilience testing. Testing

159
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:43,858
finops, uh,

160
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,309
all kinds of other practices in these modern pipelines

161
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,500
so you can have a fully automated process, uh, uh,

162
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,699
you know, and get significant productivity boost,

163
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,988
uh, boost of, uh, by in, in doing this.

164
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,738
All of this, uh, uh, uses an underlying

165
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,829
AI foundation, you know, this, which is, uh,

166
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,949
uh, you know, built of a few areas, you know,

167
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:01,738
number one is the AI agents,

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,059
uh, so we have a whole library of AI agents from, uh,

169
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,178
to do all these tasks,

170
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,559
AI agents to do DevOps tasks, you know, create CICD

171
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,084
pipelines, you know, troubleshoot. Deployment

172
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,303
failure, a build failure,

173
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,165
you know, set up policies

174
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,605
around our governance policies, templates,

175
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,894
you know, release agents to make sure

176
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:21,233
like you know you can have the future experiments and the future releases

177
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,394
and the rollouts set up properly,

178
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,894
reliability testing, you know, UI

179
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:28,004
testing, security. So these agents

180
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,084
are doing all the all the work that you would

181
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,524
do normally through a lot of manual

182
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,564
dev ops kind of work to set up, set

183
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:37,004
up your set up your STLC practices.

184
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,319
But the agents are, you know, as I'm sure in the, the

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,449
whole conference you've heard about a lot about the context,

186
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,949
uh, engineering, um, but that's a, uh,

187
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,129
that's a very important part of, uh, what we provide

188
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,170
like that's the your businesses,

189
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,119
your enterprises have a lot of context,

190
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,449
context around like, you know, uh, how your

191
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,923
services work. How your environments work, which infrastructure

192
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:58,244
you're running on, what your security policies are, what

193
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,394
tests you do, how your team structure look like.

194
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:03,225
There are all kinds of things that you have to do, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, always,

195
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,725
and that's what we're capturing in, in a knowledge

196
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,764
graph that we, we understand the knowledge graph of,

197
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:10,045
of, of, uh, any organization,

198
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,363
any software engineering team, where all the things are,

199
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,545
and that knowledge graph

200
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:15,845
is the context that, you know, how the AI agents

201
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:17,954
will use to, to do something. So for example, if we

202
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:18,564
go to our AI,

203
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,194
say create me a CICD pipeline for,

204
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,144
you know, my deployment.

205
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:24,059
Now it's like, you know,

206
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,379
if you, if you just create a generic stuff like if you

207
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,540
go to chat GPD you're gonna see a generic some

208
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,319
answers there.

209
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,920
That's not useful for any organization, any enterprise.

210
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,738
So that's where the context comes in. Like, you know,

211
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,088
in the context we understand like what does it mean?

212
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,139
What does your deployment policies mean? What are your

213
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,619
templates, what your security controls are,

214
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,019
what infrastructure you're running on,

215
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,579
what are your requirements that you need to, to run there,

216
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,608
you know, how, uh,

217
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,959
where, where things are connected with each other,

218
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,399
what secret systems you use,

219
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:50,410
all of that's,

220
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,939
you know, part of the context that we'll, that we'll use to, to

221
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,559
set up things.

222
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:55,920
And then we have the underlying orchestration layer,

223
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,213
uh, you know, these, everything. The AI agents are

224
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,384
doing the orchestration layer is

225
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,545
still, you know, could still be deterministic

226
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,665
around it so you can control what

227
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:06,704
you want AI agents to do. You want AI agents to

228
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,944
go and do a deployment in production, or

229
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,285
you want for them to create a pipeline

230
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,504
that will more deterministically do a deployment

231
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:15,983
in production. So you have the full, full

232
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:17,165
spectrum of how much

233
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,665
control AI takes over and how much,

234
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:21,903
you know, your, your deterministic automation

235
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:24,233
takes over, and that's what you know will

236
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:24,863
allow you to do.

237
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:27,858
We have about 1,000+ enterprise customers using

238
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,059
harness in, you know, in big ways

239
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,309
to solve these problems, uh,

240
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,479
you know, you'll see a lot of logos here,

241
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,139
you know, a lot of large banks, large technology companies,

242
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,619
insurance companies, airlines, you know, hospitality

243
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,158
companies,

244
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,580
you'll hear from uh from Marriott soon

245
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,817
here. And

246
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:45,119
we are doing it at a very large scale.

247
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,577
Just in the last 12 months on harness Platform,

248
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,817
there were 128 million deployments

249
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,138
that happened through Harness Platform.

250
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,658
We had 81 million builds that happened through Harness Platform.

251
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,337
11 billion tests we optimized

252
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,697
through our AI-based test optimization.

253
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,129
$1.2 trillion 1.2 trillion

254
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,109
API calls we watched and secured,

255
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:05,457
you know, $14 trillion feature flag evaluations,

256
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,967
5 million security scans,

257
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:10,744
$1.9 billion of cloud. Cost optimized

258
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,445
and a lot of people using the, you know, these

259
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,484
agents to do, do, do, uh, do these

260
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:16,125
tasks now,

261
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,565
uh, so we're very, uh, uh, uh, you

262
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,604
know, very proud, uh, that we were able to solve

263
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:23,205
these problems for many organizations and, uh,

264
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:25,075
uh, you're we're recognized, uh,

265
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:27,565
by Gartner and Forrester and as the leaders,

266
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,844
uh, you know, in the Gartner Magic Quadrant

267
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:31,585
for DevOps platforms. Harness is a leader,

268
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,274
uh, the Forester wave for DevOps platforms.

269
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:35,625
Harness is a leader now.

270
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,038
And we have a very strong partnership with AWS,

271
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,619
you know, we work very closely with AWS, uh, you

272
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,658
know, we, our, our everything that we do with

273
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:45,820
our AI is exposed through a lot of MCP tools

274
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
in our MCP server,

275
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,139
and all of those are integrated in Amazon Quiro

276
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:49,779
and, uh,

277
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:52,320
uh, you know, and, uh, any, any

278
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,440
kind of coding systems. We're very, uh, deep partnership with,

279
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,320
with, with, with Amazon.

280
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,440
Uh, you know, we are deployment ready on AWS,

281
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,558
uh, and working very closely with the

282
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,759
product teams and the, and the innovation, uh, as

283
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,899
we drive our innovation,

284
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,359
uh, on our knowledge graphs and our MCPs. So

285
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,440
if you are on AWS, which, uh, uh, you

286
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,629
know, we can, uh, we, we can definitely help you there. So

287
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,913
I'm. Going to invite our field CTO Nick

288
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,533
here on the stage to show you

289
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,114
a demo of the harness platform so you can see for

290
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,154
for real. And once, you know, after the demo

291
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:20,553
we'll have uh you know, uh

292
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,114
Adnan and Sean from from Marriott join us

293
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:25,183
and we'll have a conversation on how, how they're

294
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:25,835
using harness.

295
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:29,619
Alright,

296
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,239
I'm gonna try to keep this as brief but also

297
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,830
hopefully a little bit entertaining, give you some context.

298
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,418
I'm gonna show you a lot of what Harness does.

299
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,788
I'm not gonna talk about in the modular ways of what we're doing, but

300
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,389
we're gonna show you what this could look like,

301
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,759
um, just to give you some, some kind of ideas of how

302
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,168
this works. I'll show you the AI throughout this entire

303
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,399
process because the whole point of this is that removing

304
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,609
the worst part of the job,

305
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,178
right? If we think about where all the AI has been spent,

306
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:53,219
it's actually been the things we love doing like planning

307
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,219
and and then actually like critically thinking and

308
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,418
going through these things and developing software, but

309
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:59,460
now let's actually take away the things we hate doing, whether

310
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,538
it be, you know, running tests and waiting for them

311
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,619
to run or security. So let me walk through what this

312
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:04,808
can look like for you,

313
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,359
um, and how easy it is to set up and configure, but also

314
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,455
let's talk about. How we make this easy to

315
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,455
do the right thing. We want to make sure you have templates that it's

316
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,974
very quick and easy to get to production,

317
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,413
but also make sure that it's hard to do the wrong

318
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:17,654
things. And I know those are two very basic statements,

319
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:19,875
but we have to put policy in place to make sure

320
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,933
we're not skipping steps,

321
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,455
we're not combating that security scam on accident.

322
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,673
So making sure that we have all of the things so we know what goes into

323
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:27,678
production. Um, what you're looking at right now

324
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:29,840
is a pipeline. It's very specifically designed to go

325
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,320
from, uh, we've got a build stage, we're gonna do infrastructure

326
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,548
stand up, we're gonna deploy to multiple different environments,

327
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:36,989
and every step of the way you can see exactly what we're

328
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,080
doing. So anything that we're doing, it's entirely

329
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,119
audited. Every step of the way you can see

330
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,239
everything we've executed. You can see the input variables, you

331
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,320
can see the output variables. Everything's here for you

332
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,389
to know exactly what happened and how it

333
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,399
happened. But more importantly, what we really wanna do is

334
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,599
we wanna save you that time.

335
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,168
So one of the things you'll notice we call out really quickly is that we're saving

336
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,229
you about 1819 minutes' worth of time

337
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,450
by doing things intelligently. So for instance, if

338
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,190
I do a 200 line code change.

339
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,359
Right, I don't wanna run all 12,000

340
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,479
unit tests. That wouldn't necessarily make sense

341
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,658
because it's a very small change.

342
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,239
So Harness now understands exactly what's

343
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,320
correlated with the change that you made in the test. So

344
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,099
we can go ahead and correlate and understand.

345
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,288
Here's the uh

346
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:15,678
the changes that we made, the tests associated

347
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:17,798
with it. So now instead of running all 12,000,

348
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,200
I can run about 10% of those.

349
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:21,969
So right there alone saving about 8 minutes

350
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,379
by simply running the tests

351
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,509
again that are associated with the change,

352
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
right? If I have new tests, fine, I'll run those, or

353
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,960
if they're updated tests, I'll have to run those. I don't know how

354
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,820
they're going to respond,

355
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:33,428
so I need to see them. But at the end of the day, again,

356
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,678
take care of that pain every single build now we're

357
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:37,979
we're cutting that time away from, from your folks.

358
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:39,200
Another big one,

359
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,538
for folks oftentimes is dealing with security

360
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:42,320
vulnerabilities,

361
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,960
right? We've got tons of different scanners, so whether they're SCA

362
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,019
scanners, or are code scanners, whether they're

363
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,340
SAST, right, all the different SAST scanners,

364
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:51,609
um, you know, as you go through infrastructure scanners, so

365
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,340
forth, and even container scanners,

366
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,899
the issue is that it's very hard, it's very difficult to

367
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,899
go and actually get through and find

368
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,038
the noise throughout that or find the signal through the noise.

369
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,899
And so how do we start prioritizing those? How do we deduplicate

370
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,070
those? How do we start actually doing something that's valuable?

371
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,879
So one of the things that we can do for you very quickly.

372
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,710
Is what we'll do is we'll automatically go and aggregate,

373
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:11,908
normalize, and deduplicate all those vulnerabilities for

374
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:14,070
you. And if it's a code base, so not changing

375
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,190
a library, but if there's an actual code

376
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,269
change that needs to happen,

377
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,590
you know, you don't wanna see all 31 occurrences

378
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,668
of this sit inside of your entire environment. We can

379
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,788
show you them, but we wanna aggregate it. We wanna

380
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:24,969
know what's valuable to change

381
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:27,428
and then most importantly, I wanna be able to give you an AI

382
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:29,288
response of like how would we go do this.

383
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,979
That's fine, but in the reality today, what

384
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,029
would happen is somebody would go build me a spreadsheet. I'd take

385
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,090
that spreadsheet, I'd turn it into Jira tickets. Those Jira

386
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,580
tickets would go into a backlog, and two weeks later, somebody

387
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,440
might go fix that critical vulnerability.

388
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:41,519
And instead,

389
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,298
why would we do that? Why wouldn't we have Harness just go and

390
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:46,379
understand the lines of code with that knowledge graph that

391
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,418
Jyothi talked about? I can know the lines of

392
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,538
code, I know the vulnerability. I can actually

393
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,460
just go ahead and write you the PR.

394
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,639
Here's how you fix it.

395
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,178
So you don't have to go through the process and think about it

396
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,658
and go through this. These are the things we hate doing. Let's

397
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,129
let harness handle that portion for you,

398
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,658
so that you can go ahead and again do the

399
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:05,558
things that you love.

400
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,469
And So again, this is just in the

401
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,940
build phase, right? Just very simple things thinking

402
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,840
about things like your best engineers, taking away

403
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,229
all the extra work and the toil that we don't wanna go through

404
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,538
as this progresses forward, we're gonna build that full

405
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:19,538
bill of materials for you so you can make sure you know what's in that

406
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:21,658
artifact. You're gonna have the attestations to prove this

407
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:22,759
is that same artifact

408
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,259
so that you don't have an attack that they're gonna do through your supply

409
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,450
chain. We know this is the exact artifact. We know what it's

410
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,500
built, right? And so all throughout this process

411
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,399
only ever progressing forward,

412
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,759
if and only if

413
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,099
this actually meets those requirements.

414
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,739
Right, so after this one was, uh, we, we did our build,

415
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,849
now we're gonna go stand up some infrastructure. And so

416
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,899
the benefit here is we're gonna go look at that infrastructure and the

417
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:42,690
neat parts is,

418
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:45,178
is that not only do I wanna go and, and, and make the assumption

419
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:47,330
of like, OK, great, we're gonna do that plan, we're gonna that apply,

420
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,960
but what's it gonna cost me?

421
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,440
And I can actually go ahead and I can actually look

422
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,479
at the estimated costs in that

423
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,000
environment and I can go look, hey this is gonna 19x

424
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,119
my costs. Maybe I should pause that infrastructure

425
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,279
change until someone actually says and approves

426
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,500
that so the policy can even be on the cost

427
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,519
of what's changing. We wanna bring that information

428
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,629
now when it's valuable,

429
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,960
not a month later when it's sitting there running in production.

430
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,168
Right, as we go through this now, it's we've studied the infrastructure,

431
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:12,899
we've done the build, we've done the infrastructure.

432
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,450
Now I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna look at our uh deployments

433
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,529
into dev. We're going QA staging

434
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,849
and again following that same pipeline, being able to

435
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,038
see and and audit every single thing that we've done,

436
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,460
it's gonna go through that, making sure it's that same bill

437
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,619
of materials that we've got that same salsa check. It's gonna

438
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:27,479
make sure that we're

439
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:29,599
integrating with all of your ticketing systems.

440
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,129
So now I'm updating Jira, I'm updating Service now. I'm

441
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,139
putting the evidence in the places that are needed

442
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,979
so that I don't have to do that collection anymore,

443
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:37,960
right? Again, tasks we don't wanna do.

444
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,889
Um, this is gonna go through. This is gonna do that

445
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,940
application. It's also gonna make the database change

446
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,940
for you, so it's gonna roll out in a way that's meaningful, but

447
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,139
also a way that can roll back in the same capacity.

448
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,690
So we'll go ahead and roll out those database changes and

449
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,830
then ultimately this is just gonna roll out to, to, uh,

450
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,979
to, to the dev environment. We'll go do some tests.

451
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,340
If it's great, we'll update the tickets, right? And

452
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,899
we can see this thing kind of progress through.

453
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,274
In QA it's almost the same pipeline, but we're gonna add a whole

454
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:01,075
bunch of tests.

455
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:03,014
So we're gonna go run those tests where

456
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:05,835
our AI can actually go ahead and design

457
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,875
and create those tests on the fly. If I move a

458
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,195
button and change a button and change a color, I don't wanna go

459
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,195
put an X path somewhere. I can have this determine

460
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,634
it for me, but I can also run all the resiliency

461
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:15,783
checks throughout the process.

462
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:17,234
So now when we think about.

463
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:20,058
I wanna make sure that I've got enough replicas. I wanna

464
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:22,139
make sure that I can handle an outage. I, I'm gonna keep

465
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,139
my order. All of the things that I wanna prevent, I

466
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,139
can have those actually running as

467
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,340
chaos tests for us and again

468
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,379
only ever move forward if it meets those

469
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,538
requirements that I have. If it doesn't meet my resiliency requirements,

470
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:33,259
don't worry about it.

471
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,129
Pause the pipeline, stop,

472
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,158
go fix them,

473
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,119
right, so you can continue forward.

474
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:41,129
I'll go to one last one really quickly. I don't wanna spend too much

475
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:43,479
time. Um, and in production

476
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,109
we've been doing this for the last 8 years.

477
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,599
We, we started doing, uh, we started and

478
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,830
we came to the market when we first started as bringing

479
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,330
AI to continuous delivery. That was in 2018,

480
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,519
so be very clear, it was not generative AI. This

481
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,519
was predictive modeling. It was neural networks. It

482
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,519
was, uh, machine learning, but it

483
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,908
was thinking about deployments like your best engineers.

484
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,399
The idea here is that if I'm gonna look at the APM metrics,

485
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,630
if I'm gonna look at the logs,

486
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,154
like I don't want to have my best engineer. On the phone every

487
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:08,723
time to figure out what that should look like.

488
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:11,074
So the intention very simply, and I'll I'll show it to

489
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:13,154
you, is that as we go through this process, as you'll see,

490
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,904
it's gonna go through the production deployment again,

491
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:17,515
checking and validating all the critical vulnerabilities,

492
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,674
making sure that this is the same artifact, updating

493
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,025
the tickets, rolling through the database changes,

494
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:24,223
doing complex deployments like a canary,

495
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,594
but now it's gonna actually go verify and it's gonna look at the

496
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:27,743
things that matter to you.

497
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,275
So let me actually go over

498
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,140
here. Mhm.

499
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:35,410
Here we go.

500
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,779
So. Right now it's gonna

501
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,779
look at all the metrics that you care about. So

502
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,019
think about your response times, your, your error

503
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,098
rates, anything that you would actually consider those golden

504
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,239
metrics, any time series metrics, this for even,

505
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,068
so some of our customers, it's actually uh revenue

506
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,098
generation. So when I do an experiment and I wanna see if

507
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,180
an ad's actually giving me uh better results,

508
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,500
I can even use revenue as that time series metric. But

509
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
now I'm gonna go ahead and look at those and have an

510
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,160
understanding. This shows me that I'm slow.

511
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,719
If I'm slow as an engineer, the first thing I'd do is

512
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,699
go look at the logs,

513
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,199
right? And, and here's the area that, you

514
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:07,598
know, there are certain known logs that we've got, we've got exceptions

515
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:09,640
that happen, they shouldn't be there. And we'll show those

516
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,719
like traditionally we don't highlight them, I'll turn them on so you can

517
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,779
see them. But like here's an example

518
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,920
like this is a null pointer exception. It should not exist.

519
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,838
We know it shouldn't exist. However,

520
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,920
it's there every single time we deploy,

521
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
right? So I, if I'm, if I'm, I've been

522
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,660
in the system a long time, I've been with the company, I

523
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,779
know, OK, that, that it's OK. It shouldn't

524
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:27,959
be there but it's OK, it's fine.

525
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:30,380
We're in that same kind of concept. So what you actually

526
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,009
care about,

527
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,380
it's not about, uh, the things that we know

528
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,459
about it. So what about those ones that change in frequency and

529
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:36,699
what about that brand new one?

530
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,289
Right, that happened for the first time. Those are the signals that

531
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,469
we want to get to very quickly,

532
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,239
and based on those failures,

533
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,650
because Harness knows what you deployed, on

534
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,890
which infrastructure, with which configuration,

535
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,328
with which database changes, now we can actually

536
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,078
get you back to where you were before you started,

537
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,529
right? We'll go ahead, we'll kill that canary.

538
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,309
Alright, we'll go ahead and roll back that database change and then we'll

539
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,348
update the tickets and all of the systems to

540
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,588
make sure everyone knows exactly where we're at. We

541
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,588
know why we rolled back. We know where the errors are, and you can

542
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,469
get to what you need to.

543
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:05,949
The whole point is to solve all of those problems that

544
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:08,108
constantly take us that extra time so

545
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,650
we can start focusing on the things that matter to the business.

546
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:13,108
One last quick thing and then I'll, I'll, I'll let the stage

547
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,189
go up and, and, and, and what you're actually here for

548
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,489
and, and listen to Marriott.

549
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,299
Is all of this should be a way that it

550
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,608
could be a contribute uh contribution model,

551
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,140
right? This is not, uh, someone sitting in an ivory tower

552
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,259
building this very strict rigorous template

553
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,578
that that's the only way you can get to production. It's, it's made

554
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:29,719
so that you can actually contribute.

555
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:32,439
So even your developers, if they wanna make changes, they can commit,

556
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:33,618
uh, go ahead.

557
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:36,430
You know, give me a PR, we can go and actually merge

558
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,890
that and bring it into the system.

559
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,539
But so you can do this in the UI. You can do this as configuous

560
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,588
code. But the best part about this

561
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,750
is that now we can allow security teams, finance teams,

562
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,868
they can start running policies that make it very easy

563
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,868
for us to do the right thing but very hard for us to do

564
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:49,568
the wrong thing.

565
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:52,469
And so what I mean by that is like, let's take this whiz scan.

566
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,108
Oftentimes if you go look at your current CIN

567
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:55,779
CD systems,

568
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,910
developers will just go comment out the scan.

569
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,439
They'll just, the scan's taking too long, so they'll comment it

570
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:02,608
out, they'll run the build, and then they'll turn it back on. If you

571
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,689
don't believe me, go check your PRs. Like it's

572
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,039
like there's some people smiling, so trust me, that happens.

573
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,420
Um, you can't do that in harness. I

574
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,469
just deleted that whiz scan. I said, all right, I don't

575
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:13,568
want it. I'm an admin on this account. I'm a full

576
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,799
admin. I'm not even gonna do a PR we're gonna push

577
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,380
straight to Maine,

578
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,650
but what you'll find very quickly is I can't.

579
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:21,400
Those policies are put in place to make sure we all know

580
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,640
the rules of the game that we don't go and do something

581
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,759
wrong and and and hinder our business, so it

582
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,779
says you can't even save this pipeline

583
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:30,239
because it doesn't have the required security steps

584
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,539
that you need to go to production.

585
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,259
So again, all of those can be built specifically

586
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,699
with the context for your teams, for your

587
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,759
organizations, and you can have different setups for the different areas

588
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,000
that you have, but the whole point is to make it

589
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
extremely easy. We want everybody playing by

590
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,519
the same rules so we can all go faster.

591
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,338
Uh, I know that was a lot in a very short period of time, so

592
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:49,420
but that was a, that was just a very small subset

593
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
of what we can do, but I wanted to kind of give you some

594
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,779
of that AI to show you how it's truly removing

595
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:55,930
that, the worst part of the job for you to

596
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,689
help you then go back and do what you love.

597
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,809
So thank you. Yeah

598
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,209
So I wanted to get you a glimpse of, you know, what, uh

599
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,660
Harness does and how it solves these problems.

600
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,059
Uh, if you want to reimagine all your

601
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:13,368
DevOps, dev ops, uh, software

602
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,459
delivery practices now in the age of AI,

603
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,059
like why do you have to do so much developer toil? Why

604
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,739
is it all this scripting? Why is, like, you know,

605
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,118
it's such a mess,

606
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,459
it's, uh, you know, uh, we can help you through

607
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,785
that, uh, reimagine it all automated. All,

608
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,314
uh, you know, bring AI agents to it, uh,

609
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,604
and, uh, simplify the entire process.

610
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,824
So you, you'll hear from, uh, from Marriott. Uh,

611
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:34,414
so I'm going to invite, uh,

612
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,844
uh, you know, uh, Adnan and Sean, uh,

613
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,104
to join us here on the, on, on the stage

614
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,684
and, uh, share their journey on how they

615
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,805
were able to transform their DevOps and software

616
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:44,443
engineering through,

617
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:45,414
uh, you know, through,

618
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:46,805
through help of harness.

619
00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:48,005
Please come on.

620
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,250
So let's start by, you know, everyone knows

621
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,328
who Marriott is. You know, I'm sure everyone has stayed in

622
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:06,348
Marriott's Hotel, but it'd be great if you can,

623
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,118
uh, you know,

624
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,489
introduce, uh, you know, each of you, uh, you,

625
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,650
you'll do a much better job in that, in doing

626
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,650
that. And like, you know, what, uh, what role

627
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,160
do you play at, uh, at Marriott?

628
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,098
Sure, do you wanna start, Sean? Sure,

629
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:19,828
I'll start. So I'm Sean Corkum, senior director

630
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,348
of Devset Ops and Automation.

631
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:22,380
Um,

632
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,719
I work within our, our DevOps

633
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,868
team and also our internal

634
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:29,029
developer portals to, you know, try to make our

635
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:30,140
developers' lives easier.

636
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,479
Uh, I'm Adnan Haq, and, uh, I

637
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,799
oversee our infrastructure platforms,

638
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,739
all our, uh,

639
00:22:37,118 --> 00:22:39,140
global data centers, cloud practice,

640
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,430
uh, Devite cops, and, uh,

641
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,900
lately service reliability engineering.

642
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,390
And you can imagine the Marriott scale. Like, you know, Marriott

643
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,439
is not just one brand, it's the, you know, how

644
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,779
many properties you have now.

645
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:54,118
Uh, we're approaching 10,000. We,

646
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,670
um, we open,

647
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:58,318
including acquisition, we open about

648
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,640
a new property every 16 hours. Without

649
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,680
acquisition it's about 24 to 36

650
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,338
hours,

651
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,779
give or take 130 plus countries,

652
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,719
uh, yeah, 143 countries the last time I

653
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,439
counted. All right,

654
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,000
so the countries are countries are increasing

655
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,180
their, uh, all right,

656
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,640
so you know, we'll, we'll talk about.

657
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:16,834
Um, transformation when,

658
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,574
when any time like someone talks about any kind of transformation

659
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:21,154
starts, OK, what does transformation mean,

660
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:22,483
you know, is it, uh,

661
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:24,973
so for a company like Marriott Olivier,

662
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,483
you have like, you know, such a massive number of customers,

663
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,364
uh, consumers,

664
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,233
so, so much complexity

665
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,493
when it comes to technology, modernization,

666
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:33,505
transformation.

667
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:34,515
What does it mean?

668
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,549
I think that's a great question, um.

669
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:42,039
So typically it depends on

670
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,539
the vantage point of the person

671
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,430
that's looking at it, right? For

672
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,338
someone in the infras space,

673
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,818
perhaps it means looking at cloud

674
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:51,680
adoption.

675
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,500
Um, for someone in the application space,

676
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,578
perhaps it's moving from monolithic systems

677
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:58,920
to services based architecture.

678
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,459
Um, from a business perspective it's

679
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:03,539
about more cross-sell opportunities, more

680
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,818
upsell opportunities, higher revenue, right?

681
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,828
Um,

682
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,358
same thing can be said for the process

683
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:11,640
side. They're looking at processes, how to streamline

684
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,078
it, but to me transform transformation

685
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,279
is actually all of the above. They all

686
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,019
have to happen

687
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,500
at the same time.

688
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:19,959
Um,

689
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,400
in order for an organization

690
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,500
to operate.

691
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:26,818
In a manner that increases its velocity

692
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,519
and its ability to roll out its

693
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,739
products and services at a faster pace,

694
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,239
um, so if you really look

695
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,838
at the crux of what enables

696
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:39,160
that, it's moving away from the traditional

697
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,479
concepts of blocking governance and

698
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,799
bringing in technologies to automate

699
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:46,239
where the default answer is no, you

700
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:48,239
need an approval, the default answer is

701
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:50,539
yes, answer is yes, you're approved.

702
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:52,059
Unless

703
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
there's a reason not to approve it, right, automate

704
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,719
the approval and you know,

705
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,199
and the only the failure condition requires an approval,

706
00:24:58,338 --> 00:24:59,489
not the normal condition.

707
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,920
And when you do that, you actually reduce

708
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
the cognitive overload, right?

709
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,578
Um, you and Nick both talked about toil,

710
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,568
uh, and if you look at,

711
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
um, any of the team members that are trying

712
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,680
to build a product,

713
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,578
deliver something, a service,

714
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,400
you know, easily 30 to 40% of their

715
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,618
time in a large enterprise, maybe even higher.

716
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,358
Uh, is the cognitive overload

717
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:22,598
of not

718
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,059
developing that product or service, but everything

719
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,598
else that has to be done, change management,

720
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:29,539
uh, approvals,

721
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:32,420
socialization, funding, managing

722
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,979
the budgets, etc. right?

723
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:36,039
And that's where that standardization

724
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,989
can actually reduce the cognitive

725
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:41,068
overload and, and that's where we are

726
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:43,259
really excited about harness because

727
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,469
that's exactly what it does, that's where it plays. It

728
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:46,689
reduces the cognitive

729
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:48,489
load of our

730
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,029
um of our team members so that they can move faster

731
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,729
at scale.

732
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,969
And that

733
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:56,130
leads us to the definition of modernization.

734
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:58,939
So what, what triggered for you guys, like,

735
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:00,828
uh, OK, let's go ahead and uh.

736
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,259
You know, you have old ways of doing things. You

737
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,289
know, what's like at some point, like, the

738
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,328
frustration from it builds up some for

739
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:09,380
many people it's like, you know, I'm more code coming out

740
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
with AI or something is we have, we

741
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,160
have to move to cloud. We have to do something

742
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,769
and let's, let's rethink, you know, why are we

743
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,769
slowing down and where the developer toil is. What, what,

744
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:18,539
what was that.

745
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,170
Yeah, I, I don't know if there was a single

746
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,430
thing, um, I think it,

747
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:24,729
uh, you know, um,

748
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,449
what leads an organization to transformation

749
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:30,539
is a series of things that happen,

750
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,949
right? When they grow fast, when the processes

751
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:33,650
stop working,

752
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,509
uh, when things, when the hidden factories

753
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:38,229
that were created for a purpose at one,

754
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:40,630
at one point are now just running and,

755
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,828
and people are are doing things just

756
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:44,078
because that's how it's been done,

757
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,890
right? Um, so all of that was happening,

758
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,250
um. The catalyst

759
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,519
was um.

760
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:52,449
Uh, uh, was COVID,

761
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:55,328
Marriott being a hospitality company, um,

762
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:57,630
our, our biggest challenge was going

763
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,670
through COVID when the hotels were literally

764
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,449
boarded up.

765
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:03,630
So coming out of it there was a unique opportunity

766
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,828
to really rethink,

767
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,500
um, the teams were, uh,

768
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,328
were reduced, uh,

769
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:12,009
significantly just to keep the lights on.

770
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,250
Investments obviously were difficult during

771
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,000
that era.

772
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,469
Uh, so when we started rebuilding and when

773
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,578
the demand actually, um,

774
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,670
people talked about all these.

775
00:27:21,384 --> 00:27:23,693
V shaped recovery and W shaped and every

776
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:26,285
alphabet, no one talked about an Is shaped recovery.

777
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,884
That's what Marriott went through.

778
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:30,223
We shot through the roof. We were

779
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:32,305
trying to shut down our mainframes while we were

780
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:33,453
buying new mainframes,

781
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:36,243
so it was very interesting. So that kind of helped us

782
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:38,743
in uh really reimagining how we

783
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:40,384
want to operate as we move forward.

784
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:43,064
So with the eyes shape recovery, you have no other option. You have

785
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:45,144
to move really, really fast. You have

786
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:47,233
to do everything. You have to keep the lights on.

787
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:49,324
You can't say no to the demand that's coming

788
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:51,500
in. Uh, you have to restart

789
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,838
your properties and you have to rethink

790
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,140
how you're doing business because the old processes

791
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,160
were, were pretty broken at that point.

792
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,630
So what's, uh,

793
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,979
uh, how did you think about where to start?

794
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,160
You said, you know, you're

795
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,578
not moving fast enough in your innovation,

796
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,880
you know, or the move to digital,

797
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:09,969
um,

798
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,299
all the things that you need to do to, you know, in that

799
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,299
ice shape recovery. So how did you think

800
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:16,479
about, let's move the break the problems and

801
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:17,439
figure out where to start,

802
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:18,818
yeah, um.

803
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,739
So it has to start with a vision.

804
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,750
What is the problem that we're trying to solve? That's step

805
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,500
number one,

806
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,910
but you know, vision can only give you

807
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,000
so much. You have to really define it at

808
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,118
the right level of success criteria that

809
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:34,059
you wanna achieve,

810
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,380
right? Um,

811
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:37,880
and the flexibility that you need

812
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,598
to have,

813
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,000
uh, to deliver on that vision. So it's, it's all

814
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,219
about thinking big but delivering small,

815
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,880
right? Um.

816
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,809
Looking at areas that had the,

817
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:50,130
the, the largest blast radius and

818
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,209
those small levers that could

819
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,108
really create big waves,

820
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,689
right? and identifying them and

821
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:58,229
prioritizing them and I feel

822
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:00,549
that platforms is one area

823
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,279
where you could actually,

824
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:04,809
you know, um, where you can rethink

825
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,000
how a platform is operating. We, we actually

826
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,108
rethought how infrastructure was,

827
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,400
was operating and we went from becoming an

828
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,608
infra uh from being an infrastructure team to becoming

829
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:15,088
a platform team, right?

830
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,900
And we, uh, we said we're gonna build that once

831
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,559
we're gonna standardize it, we're gonna put

832
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,868
all the security control governance,

833
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:25,779
everything inside our platform so that our products

834
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:26,719
can inherit it

835
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,279
and as a result we're gonna reduce

836
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:31,539
the um the toil and

837
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,578
the cognitive load on our

838
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,660
engineers who are developing those products so

839
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,239
that they don't have to redo it.

840
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,539
um. It's also

841
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,630
really important to have

842
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,858
an agile mindset, and I'm not

843
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:47,019
talking about a framework like safe,

844
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,818
uh, scale agile framework.

845
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm really talking about an agile mindset,

846
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,559
being a, uh, having the ability,

847
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,160
uh, to change course at any

848
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,170
point. When you see that there is

849
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,209
a better option, right? We can't live our

850
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,318
lives on shortcuts, but we should always keep an

851
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:03,828
eye

852
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:06,328
for a shortcut and if we find it, we should

853
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:07,650
be able to, um,

854
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:10,130
have that agile mindset and not

855
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,170
consider that as a weakness or

856
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:12,979
a problem,

857
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,689
but. As, as, uh,

858
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,759
uh, as an enablement for our teams

859
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,390
to make those decisions, right, and move forward,

860
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:22,939
standardization is another area where

861
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,699
I feel it's, it's a small,

862
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:27,420
small thing that reaps big results

863
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,019
once we have standardized our deployment pipelines,

864
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:31,318
right? Sean and his team

865
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:33,719
standardized the deployment pipelines.

866
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,338
Um, that was a pretty big impact

867
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:38,529
because now you've taken that overload, that,

868
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:40,660
that cognitive load from the

869
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,400
engineers.

870
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,910
Hundreds and thousands of engineers

871
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:46,449
by just building that one pipeline and

872
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:47,289
standardizing it.

873
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,689
That's the, that's the platform effect, right?

874
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:50,509
You do it once,

875
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,009
uh, you know, the, the move of move

876
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,170
from DevOps teams and, uh, infrastructure

877
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,250
teams to like you this is the ticket, do something

878
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,410
to. Yeah, give a platform

879
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,019
where everything's automated, standardized.

880
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,500
It's, it's simpler for everyone,

881
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,239
absolutely, and that's a big part where harness

882
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:05,939
came in for us too,

883
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,479
like being able to provide that, uh, it's

884
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:10,519
rich API systems that then allow

885
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,180
us to

886
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,098
create other automations and

887
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,799
get to the point where developers are

888
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,039
not having to look at a bunch of things, not having

889
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,150
to have that, you know,

890
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:21,640
tribal knowledge of I have to go talk to this

891
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,709
person for this, that person for this, submit a

892
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:24,578
ticket over here.

893
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,219
Uh, for us internally, uh,

894
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,799
they can go right to our, uh, our IDP

895
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,019
we call it the developer's concierge, uh,

896
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:32,920
and

897
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,279
that can trigger and build everything right from off

898
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,219
the bat. So like,

899
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm starting a new product, I can just go

900
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,799
click I need this at microservice.

901
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,759
Sets them up in harness, gets them completely

902
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,160
configured, creates their repositories,

903
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,199
gets them going, and

904
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,719
really keeping your application developers

905
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,719
like writing application

906
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:54,000
code is incredibly

907
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,539
important

908
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,880
and not having to think about all these other things like

909
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
uh my security and this and that

910
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,660
like just.

911
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:02,660
Help take that off their plate and

912
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,779
just that one feature that Seann just

913
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:05,699
talked about

914
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,358
resulted in our time

915
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:11,299
of about 6 months to build an integrated

916
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:13,799
environment at a cost of roughly $500,000

917
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,279
to 35 minute self-service deployment.

918
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,439
Engineers can do it in the middle of the night.

919
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,568
Great data point, you know, that's,

920
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,338
that is the power of automation and standardization

921
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:26,420
and simplification. Like, you know, that's what I was, you

922
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,799
know, when I talk about the

923
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:29,019
impact of AI,

924
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,420
you know, this AI for coding and this AI for everything

925
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,769
after coding, and the impact of AI for

926
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:35,930
after coding could be some, could be big numbers,

927
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:38,019
and, uh, like, like this. So, you know, thanks for sharing

928
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:40,019
that. So when, when, when you guys looked at,

929
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:42,140
you know, let's go and, uh, create this

930
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,459
platform engineering concept and a developer

931
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:45,199
concierge.

932
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,078
And you started looking at tools

933
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:49,630
and the the tool chain in in in the market

934
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,939
has been like there's all kind of older tool chain,

935
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:52,719
you know, there's

936
00:32:52,979 --> 00:32:54,660
next generation solutions like harness.

937
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:55,920
How do you guys, uh,

938
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,759
you know, maybe share with the people here,

939
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:00,529
uh, why did you pick harness.

940
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,463
So for me, kind of going through things,

941
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:05,755
uh, I've, I've gone through this rodeo

942
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:08,213
before of, of helping a, a, a

943
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:10,515
company kind of modernize the space

944
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:11,555
and

945
00:33:12,174 --> 00:33:14,174
one of the big things that I've learned from that that I

946
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:16,174
wish I could go back and redo was

947
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:16,953
the fact that.

948
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:21,019
There's, you

949
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:22,680
need something that you can actually

950
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,660
have uh an auditable governance

951
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,259
around,

952
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,739
um, so like Nick was showing in his

953
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:29,509
demo, you know,

954
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:32,049
engineers will just, oh well that scan's

955
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:34,299
failing. I don't wanna deal with it right now, they'll remove it

956
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:36,818
and a lot of systems make it very

957
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,868
difficult, uh, not on purpose,

958
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,279
but just because of,

959
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:41,239
you know,

960
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:43,019
how they were initially architected.

961
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,180
To kind of uh

962
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,699
provide that governance

963
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,279
and when it came to harness having

964
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:49,789
OPA

965
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:52,660
big baked right into the platform,

966
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,160
now I can easily write a Rego policy

967
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,699
that will look across everything

968
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,118
and we're able to create these

969
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:01,660
templates at the account level everyone can inherit,

970
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,180
but they can add to

971
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,568
they can't take out.

972
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,400
There's always gonna be little quirks about their individual

973
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:08,699
applications that they'll need something

974
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,168
um. But they can't skip

975
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:13,349
any of these processes anymore and

976
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,550
we didn't have to spend

977
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,409
8 months writing some custom process

978
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,519
to build that governance around a different tool.

979
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,250
We had this all right off the bat.

980
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:22,989
Beyond that,

981
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,969
harness out of the box for us had

982
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,010
significant, uh, advanced

983
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,128
capabilities for the deployments like uh Nick had

984
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:31,050
mentioned Canary.

985
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,539
Doing Canary

986
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,070
is actually a little complicated,

987
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,489
uh, and we get it out of the box right

988
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,148
there with this.

989
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,809
So we were able to go from a

990
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:42,860
system that was firing forget

991
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,409
so you don't know if your deployment

992
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,648
actually succeeded, but you know

993
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,829
it triggered something off to Kubernetes

994
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:52,389
uh to now being able to

995
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,309
have it up,

996
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:54,820
make sure it's running,

997
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,590
watch it for however long that we want

998
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,610
integrated with our APM tools and

999
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,668
really make sure

1000
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,179
it really is doing what we expected

1001
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:04,550
and if it's not.

1002
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:06,289
Let's go back

1003
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,590
No harm, no foul to the system.

1004
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,168
Nobody noticed. Nobody's getting paged at

1005
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,909
3 in the morning because of it,

1006
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,360
uh, and we're all able to, uh, to

1007
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,309
keep moving along.

1008
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,168
Harness was the, the only system out

1009
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,829
there that allowed us to

1010
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,708
really leapfrog a good 10 years

1011
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,389
from where we were to where

1012
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:26,929
I wanted to get us to

1013
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:28,090
in one shot,

1014
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,349
and that's the definition of.

1015
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:33,099
Everything is approved unless it's not

1016
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,619
right as opposed to nothing is approved

1017
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,639
unless it is,

1018
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,300
but that level of automation that harness

1019
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
has given us has really

1020
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,360
allowed us to implement that principle,

1021
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,329
right, um, and then there are other

1022
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:48,570
areas of course in, in the transformation,

1023
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,820
but at least from a deployment

1024
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,059
perspective and, uh, canary

1025
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:55,039
releases and feature flags,

1026
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:57,418
these are capabilities that are coming out of the box,

1027
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:59,610
so. So how do

1028
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,688
you, how do you convince the dev teams? Like one of the

1029
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:03,628
things that we hear quite a lot is, uh,

1030
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,208
you know, the platform engineering team, the leadership

1031
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,309
team, very convinced that we gotta modernize,

1032
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:10,369
uh, and automate everything,

1033
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,849
but the dev teams are used to doing certain

1034
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:14,889
things like they have CICD systems. They've,

1035
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,750
they've used for 5 years, 10 years.

1036
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,369
They've done some ways, and then there's a resistance

1037
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:20,889
that you have to overcome. So how did you guys do that?

1038
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:22,639
Uh, for us,

1039
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,969
it, it's Adnan mentioned, we kind of followed

1040
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:27,010
that agile mindset within our

1041
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,148
space. We started small,

1042
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:29,478
day one,

1043
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,898
you know, piloting with harness as we

1044
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,519
first started,

1045
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,679
we started dog fooding it ourselves.

1046
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,688
There were some teams, uh, as, you know, we

1047
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:40,000
kept moving forward, some teams that were a little more

1048
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,648
interested in, in forward thinking,

1049
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,090
we started engaging with them. They started

1050
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,989
getting quick wins.

1051
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,599
So now we've got a couple of teams getting quick wins

1052
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,820
and now their leadership

1053
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,179
groups are seeing like, oh well this group's

1054
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,418
delivering faster

1055
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,739
and it can start growing organically

1056
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,320
versus just being like a mandate

1057
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,360
to, you know, shove down everybody's throat,

1058
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:00,340
they start going, oh.

1059
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,418
I can, I can move faster. I can

1060
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:05,579
move safer. I'm not getting paid for

1061
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,478
things as much.

1062
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,349
I'm

1063
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,860
able to focus more on the

1064
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,489
thing I actually like to do in writing my

1065
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,869
application and it starts

1066
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,898
taking off like fire. So if you can build that

1067
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:18,949
kind of excitement and

1068
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:21,219
get your, your customers quick wins,

1069
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:23,039
start showing it, start showing the value.

1070
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:24,739
Makes it a lot easier,

1071
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,320
yeah, you, you have to, you have to get to this

1072
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,340
roughly 30 to 35%,

1073
00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:32,500
um, of mindset shift,

1074
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,619
right? Once you have that,

1075
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:37,079
I, I feel the teams build escape velocity,

1076
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,320
then, then they just have to move forward, right? They

1077
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,418
continue on and just rinse and repeat,

1078
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,840
uh, and for us to reach that 35%.

1079
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:47,610
Like Sean said, we had to eat our own dog

1080
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,688
food, so we actually brought in harness to

1081
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:51,889
automate the processes within the infrastructure

1082
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:52,989
and platforms team.

1083
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,110
We were still deploying infrastructure, but

1084
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,168
everything was being done through harness.

1085
00:37:58,989 --> 00:37:59,949
And once we,

1086
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:01,289
once we, uh,

1087
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,590
figured out all the kinks, worked it out, and

1088
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,648
it was working stably, that's when we started

1089
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,789
the self-service with a few teams and we

1090
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,789
said you can do it any time, you don't

1091
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:10,849
have to depend on us

1092
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:13,389
and, and, and that one piece where a

1093
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:15,469
team doesn't have to depend on someone, an

1094
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:17,070
engineer doesn't have to depend on someone.

1095
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:18,699
That sells itself, yeah, yeah,

1096
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:21,139
and engineer, that's what engineers want. They don't want

1097
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,958
to depend on someone. They want, like, you know,

1098
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,449
uh, they don't want to even know about

1099
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:27,699
most of those things. That's not their strength. So

1100
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:28,438
it's good to,

1101
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:31,409
that, you know, what you, what you guys did is what, uh,

1102
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,619
we see as a successful model because otherwise if you go

1103
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:34,918
from top down and say

1104
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,539
go and replace your things and, uh, people

1105
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,579
just don't do it. It also helps when you can tell

1106
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,760
your engineers, I'll have your CI time,

1107
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,280
yes. Uh,

1108
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,148
yeah, so yeah, let's talk about that. Like, you know, the,

1109
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:48,269
the results and the numbers, uh, and I'm

1110
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:50,550
sure like, you know, uh, uh, folks in the audience

1111
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,789
would love to hear what are the outcomes of all this,

1112
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:54,869
uh, what we're able to achieve. So half the build

1113
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,898
time, yeah, so I mean for us our,

1114
00:38:56,978 --> 00:38:59,188
our CI time dropped from, you know, roughly

1115
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:01,349
12 minutes on our old platform down

1116
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:02,409
to 5,

1117
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:04,708
and this guy doesn't know it, but we actually did

1118
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:06,909
some tweaks about 2 weeks ago and it's, it's a little

1119
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,000
lower. We're we're closing in on 4 minutes for CI.

1120
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:12,489
Um, and how much was it before,

1121
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,409
before it, it was 12, it was 12,

1122
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,110
but the caveat on

1123
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:19,769
that was, it was 12 but with less

1124
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:20,570
things in it,

1125
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:23,449
so moving into harness we've got

1126
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,610
all of those safeguards and all those extra bits

1127
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,909
to help start making.

1128
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:30,159
Uh, things like auditability

1129
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:31,780
being more automated

1130
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,280
where teams can just go, OK, here's

1131
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,378
a graph auditor, you got

1132
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:38,378
all the information you need versus having to

1133
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,458
do 1000 things because they only really

1134
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,500
did like a docker build, maybe didn't even run their

1135
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,938
tests, who knows?

1136
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:45,610
They now all have that,

1137
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:48,139
but we still shrunk the amount of time it took.

1138
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:50,760
Yeah, the, the 12 to 5 is

1139
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,898
all the, um, all the tweaks

1140
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:55,478
that were made within harness right pre-harness

1141
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,110
era.

1142
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:59,070
Um, I, I think it's, it would be unfair

1143
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,110
to, to, uh, judge that as a

1144
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,429
12 minute deployment

1145
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,840
because the amount of capabilities

1146
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,728
that we had using Jenkins

1147
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,469
were probably half of what we have

1148
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,469
today. So not only did we

1149
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:13,659
double the things that we're doing during

1150
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,739
deploy deployment checks, balances,

1151
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,769
whatever, OPA policies, etc.

1152
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:20,269
we also reduced the time on top of that, right?

1153
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:21,128
So, so the.

1154
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:23,750
Uh, the benefit is actually significantly better

1155
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,809
than what that metric

1156
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,469
tells from 12 to 5.5 minutes. It

1157
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,409
doesn't do justice.

1158
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,590
And then going along with that too, I mean, our,

1159
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:33,309
like you mentioned earlier, our, uh, environment

1160
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,590
provisioning going down from like 6 months to,

1161
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,378
you know, 35 minutes, 35 minutes tops,

1162
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,789
sometimes less depending on what they need, uh.

1163
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:42,208
And

1164
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,079
trying to do that level of automation

1165
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,938
previously with Jenkins was

1166
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:49,039
very challenging to say the least.

1167
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,579
Um, harnesses API system

1168
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,898
make it, makes it significantly easier

1169
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,139
for us to be able to work with that and get it going.

1170
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:59,539
And uh how, how do the security

1171
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,639
teams uh respond to this? Are they happy

1172
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,059
that they are ecstatic that

1173
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:06,179
everything is getting scanned now and

1174
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,219
when they wanna find it and know what's going

1175
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,219
on, they can see it all and

1176
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,820
they know everything we're getting, you know,

1177
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,179
like all the S-bombs, the salsa,

1178
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:16,610
all the artifacts signing, all that's actually

1179
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,199
happening.

1180
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,500
They're like, thank you, thank you,

1181
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,699
appreciate it. Yeah,

1182
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,760
it's, it's, uh,

1183
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,099
uh, the impact of modernizing, you

1184
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,309
know, where, where you,

1185
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,648
you automate security, security is happy and

1186
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:31,898
developers are happy because they don't want to be chased by security

1187
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:33,938
and, you know, did you run my scan or not

1188
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:35,030
and all that stuff, yeah,

1189
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,619
exactly, yeah, and, and once they know

1190
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,239
that it's gonna

1191
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:40,239
happen automatically.

1192
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:43,199
They start removing those governance processes,

1193
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:45,438
those oversights, those meetings that you have

1194
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:47,719
to go to to get the I approve message

1195
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:48,918
from all stakeholders,

1196
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:50,659
right, change management meetings,

1197
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,369
all of that just starts to die on the vine

1198
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,398
by itself.

1199
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,119
That's what I like to say like the,

1200
00:41:56,398 --> 00:41:58,534
the new cabin. The no cab like

1201
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:00,543
your your pipeline should be the cab like you know

1202
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,594
it's like that's everything is in

1203
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:04,684
there like why do you need anything else? The automated pipeline

1204
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:07,014
should be the cab and you know what it does is it actually

1205
00:42:07,014 --> 00:42:09,043
reduces a lot of escalations because the number of

1206
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:11,175
escalations that came to me, hey, we, we need

1207
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:13,313
an approval to move forward because of some.

1208
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,860
Some fire drill some issue,

1209
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,360
right? And, and now you're under pressure

1210
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,639
to approve or be that

1211
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:22,619
ass who's gonna say no,

1212
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,320
go back, fix it you automate it,

1213
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:28,019
you kinda remove yourself from the picture,

1214
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,860
uh, it's the system,

1215
00:42:30,438 --> 00:42:31,110
you know, as,

1216
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:32,079
as a,

1217
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,398
you know, boss, the, the, the

1218
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:36,559
thing that I hate the most is like someone asked me to approve something

1219
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,619
I don't know what I'm approving.

1220
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,030
That's a big problem. Like, you know, when you are under the fire,

1221
00:42:40,148 --> 00:42:41,030
like, you know, I don't under.

1222
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,500
Should I approve it? Did you do all the right things or not? What's

1223
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,449
the, what's the proof,

1224
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:46,659
uh, and you know that's why you need all the,

1225
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:49,179
you know, some process that approving instead of you approving

1226
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:50,409
most of the times, yeah,

1227
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,728
absolutely. And it, and it does it. And,

1228
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:53,829
and those are not,

1229
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,110
those weren't even the benefits that we were looking

1230
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,228
at. Those are just benefits that you get

1231
00:42:58,228 --> 00:43:00,668
because you do it the right way, right? And you standardize

1232
00:43:00,668 --> 00:43:02,769
the processes. It's also really important

1233
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:04,188
to, um.

1234
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:07,250
Not automate for the sake of automation,

1235
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:09,739
right? Um, a lot of times, uh,

1236
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:11,918
organizations would automate toil.

1237
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,349
That's not really good automation. Um,

1238
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:17,969
you, you have to first simplify the

1239
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:20,208
process. You have to make sure it's completely

1240
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,228
streamlined and then you automate it.

1241
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:24,418
Yeah, one of the things that we, um,

1242
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:26,929
see in many organizations like you have 10,000 pipelines,

1243
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:28,969
20,000 pipelines, uh, that are built in

1244
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:30,309
Jenkins or something before.

1245
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,869
And when people say I'm gonna move to harness, let

1246
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:35,119
me bring the 10,000 pipelines from Jenkins to harness.

1247
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:37,449
So that's, that's, you lose the whole point. Like

1248
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,648
that's like you're taking the toil and the bad thing

1249
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:41,929
and harness you probably need like 30 or 40

1250
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:43,639
or 50, no more than that

1251
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,219
if, if that, I think we.

1252
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:49,280
Really have like less than 10

1253
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,769
types and that builds everything we need

1254
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,409
and like I said because of the fact that we can

1255
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:56,708
provide that that level they don't have to think

1256
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,789
it but they can add 2 for

1257
00:43:58,789 --> 00:43:59,909
the specific things they need.

1258
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:01,938
There's no reason for all those,

1259
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,769
and now we're, now we're, uh, taking that

1260
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,019
same concept to

1261
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,320
because of the scale of Marriott we, uh,

1262
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:10,610
we have systems that are more centralized

1263
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,889
in nature like our global reservation system,

1264
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,809
right? It has to be in sync with

1265
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:17,679
each and every one of those 10,000 properties

1266
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,309
and the property management system.

1267
00:44:19,648 --> 00:44:22,128
So we, we started using harness,

1268
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:22,769
um,

1269
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,289
more at the, the central systems

1270
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:26,550
what we call above property.

1271
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,179
But now we're working on efforts where we're gonna

1272
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:29,760
take it

1273
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,340
to at property workloads

1274
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,458
as well. And, and within that, maybe

1275
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,438
the 10 goes to 20 at most,

1276
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,360
but

1277
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:40,800
with those 20 pipelines, we're going to be deploying

1278
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,989
in 143 countries

1279
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:46,019
across multiple continents

1280
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,590
with different um

1281
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,010
legal and policy challenges,

1282
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,500
right? Um, whether it's China

1283
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
or it's India or it's Germany or,

1284
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:55,438
or, or wherever,

1285
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,329
right? All of that built into the pipeline

1286
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:00,398
just with a few patterns,

1287
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,860
that's the power of standardization and doing it the right

1288
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,878
way. That, that's so great to hear. That's

1289
00:45:04,878 --> 00:45:07,059
what we like to evangelize a lot like, you know, if

1290
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:07,878
you standardize

1291
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:09,478
the, um,

1292
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,820
every app team thinks that app is very different, but

1293
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,978
in the, in the end, like, you know, you have some patterns like 10

1294
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,208
patterns, 20 patterns, and.

1295
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,659
And you standardize you gain gain so much, but you

1296
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:20,059
want to have the flexibility, a bit, bit of flexibility

1297
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:22,059
there with the guardrails. So that's why

1298
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:22,860
we had this, you know,

1299
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,418
opine templates, but you can still go and modify,

1300
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:26,519
you know, but as

1301
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,119
you have to follow the guardrails.

1302
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,159
Exactly, there's only so many ways to build a docker image.

1303
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,409
Yes, yeah,

1304
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,438
cool. So, um, let's talk about AI a

1305
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:37,478
bit. You know, we are, uh, uh, it's, it's hard

1306
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:39,519
not to talk about AI in the, in the world of software

1307
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:41,800
engineering. So how, how are you guys thinking about AI

1308
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,958
and, uh, how does AI

1309
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,898
play the role, uh, in the future here

1310
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:48,500
to me, so coming from my vantage point

1311
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,539
of being in the dev ops space

1312
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,119
and whatnot.

1313
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,329
I think

1314
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:54,989
that particular area is

1315
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,110
so ripe for being

1316
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,599
able to take advantage of AI,

1317
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:02,000
uh, there is so much that happens

1318
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,070
within, you know, from going from

1319
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,579
story to production and so much

1320
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:08,070
information that.

1321
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,719
AI being able to grab that

1322
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:12,719
context from what's changing in

1323
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,019
the code to what's changing in the environment

1324
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,329
to the tests,

1325
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:19,079
being able to look at all of that and start

1326
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,418
helping fix

1327
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,179
the little problems that we don't wanna deal with,

1328
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,539
that is

1329
00:46:24,878 --> 00:46:27,000
such a like you saw on the graph, such

1330
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,478
a huge waste of application developers'

1331
00:46:29,478 --> 00:46:30,800
times and talent.

1332
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,000
AI is, I think,

1333
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,539
really going to take a big chunk

1334
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,739
of that out and let them focus

1335
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:38,648
more on,

1336
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:41,260
you know, working with cursor Windsurf,

1337
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:42,978
uh, Quiro, etc.

1338
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,378
and Cloud code and focusing

1339
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:47,500
on their applications and being able to

1340
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,239
create amazing things

1341
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:51,938
and not have to worry about, oh

1342
00:46:51,938 --> 00:46:53,938
my unit has failed, uh, oh I've got

1343
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,860
a new CVE that popped up like.

1344
00:46:56,829 --> 00:46:57,800
Just let it,

1345
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,559
you look at it, let it resolve, resolve

1346
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,760
it, give you the PR so you still have a

1347
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,619
human in the loop,

1348
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:06,199
make sure it doesn't do something a little crazy

1349
00:47:06,648 --> 00:47:08,860
and go from there. And then

1350
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
the next step from there is as that continues

1351
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,179
to mature

1352
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:14,478
and you build out better systems around

1353
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:16,550
that and the models continue to get better,

1354
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:17,659
you can

1355
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,579
stop thinking about that human in the loop on that PR

1356
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,760
and just let the pipeline handle

1357
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,079
it because as you said, the pipeline's the new cab.

1358
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,349
Yeah, um,

1359
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:28,610
and, um,

1360
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,668
a lot of this work people don't, uh, you know, people

1361
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:33,739
are struggling to do,

1362
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,110
you know, it's like pipelines can do a lot

1363
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,148
of automation, but you still need to bring AI to write

1364
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,500
the test, you know, to interpret the outcomes

1365
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,750
of the test, you know, maybe to fix the code if something

1366
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,648
failed, you know,

1367
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:46,128
developers don't really want to do it, and, and, and

1368
00:47:46,148 --> 00:47:48,269
it's AI can do a better job on

1369
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:49,360
many of these things now,

1370
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,820
uh, and to create all the checks

1371
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,869
and balances on the code coming in, you know, one

1372
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:55,849
of the things that we keep hearing is the.

1373
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:58,360
Just the, the code volume with AI is very

1374
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,559
high and it's, it like

1375
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,559
the, the same applications that used to

1376
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,599
have a million lines of code base would

1377
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,760
probably have for the same functionality like 2 or 3 million

1378
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,760
lines of code base now because AI writes

1379
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,539
a lot of code.

1380
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,889
It can be a little verbose,

1381
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,228
yeah, and, and it, it,

1382
00:48:15,668 --> 00:48:17,909
it all goes back to that earlier comment

1383
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:19,769
around reducing the cognitive load,

1384
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,929
right, and I feel,

1385
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,148
um,

1386
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,510
as we modernize and as we go

1387
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,628
more towards, uh, more advanced

1388
00:48:26,628 --> 00:48:28,708
systems and, and ways to develop

1389
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,188
them, um.

1390
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:32,909
The the definition of cognitive load also

1391
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:33,590
changes,

1392
00:48:34,188 --> 00:48:36,349
so unit test becomes

1393
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:37,469
a cognitive load,

1394
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,659
right? um,

1395
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,110
uh, keeping tabs on all the different things

1396
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,389
that have to happen starting from scratch

1397
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:45,389
all of that becomes unnecessary

1398
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,010
things

1399
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:48,324
that if. We allow AI to do

1400
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:50,353
that, then we, uh, uh,

1401
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:52,445
then we in turn allow our engineers

1402
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:54,905
to really keep their eyes on the ball

1403
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:57,253
and really think about what the big picture

1404
00:48:57,253 --> 00:48:59,324
is, what the real value is that they need to

1405
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:01,675
produce with that code, with that product, whatever

1406
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:02,945
it is that they're creating,

1407
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:04,144
and a lot of times

1408
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:05,773
we, um,

1409
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,375
engineers can't focus on that value.

1410
00:49:08,523 --> 00:49:10,724
They take their eyes off the ball because they're just

1411
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:12,724
so inundated with all

1412
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:14,583
these million steps that have to happen

1413
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:16,603
before the value is even driven.

1414
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:19,369
And and many of those things they will lose

1415
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:21,340
track, you know, some balls will be dropped.

1416
00:49:21,688 --> 00:49:23,208
It's hard to just, you know,

1417
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:25,519
uh, keep up with everything that's that's

1418
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:27,969
uh that's gonna happen, the million steps.

1419
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,148
So, what, what advice would you give to, uh,

1420
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:33,389
to the audience here, if people are looking

1421
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:34,789
at, uh, we have

1422
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,949
certain ways of doing things, CICD,

1423
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,300
uh, but we are looking at modernizing

1424
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,628
and, and looking at harness, uh, what

1425
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:42,429
advice would you give to them?

1426
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,280
Um,

1427
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:48,000
I would say particularly when you're looking to modernize

1428
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,260
within the CICE space.

1429
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,860
I, I said it kind of jokingly earlier

1430
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,059
like there's only so many ways to build a docker image

1431
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,599
really kind of keeping that in mind,

1432
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,099
you know, standardization

1433
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,199
will set you free

1434
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:01,599
in this space

1435
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,438
as much as any other,

1436
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:06,199
so having the ability to create

1437
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:08,300
a standardized template for the

1438
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,840
various types of, uh,

1439
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:12,000
applications that you'll need,

1440
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:14,800
uh, it's huge. Don't drag

1441
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,519
along the old tech debt

1442
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:18,619
just let it die.

1443
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:20,648
Uh, move on to the new system

1444
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:23,510
and let them start seeing the, the early

1445
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,820
wins. Find some teams in particular

1446
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,949
that are more for, you know, forward

1447
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:29,389
thinking that really wanna get,

1448
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,289
uh, get going in this,

1449
00:50:31,688 --> 00:50:33,760
um, and work with them. Remember,

1450
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:34,889
they're your customer.

1451
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,119
So you need to make sure that their voice

1452
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:38,898
is heard

1453
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,360
and you're delivering them the product that they need as

1454
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,969
well. Uh,

1455
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,519
100% agree early wins

1456
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:46,780
are extremely important.

1457
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,179
Uh, and they get overlooked,

1458
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,679
um, and the higher

1459
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:53,699
the velocity is, the more

1460
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,918
likely that you're gonna get some early wins.

1461
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,239
So velocity also matters, right?

1462
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:58,918
Not speed,

1463
00:50:59,228 --> 00:50:59,840
velocity,

1464
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,280
right? It's a vector quantity, so

1465
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,340
it's not the distance, it's the displacement,

1466
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,559
right, uh, between the two points. So, so

1467
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,619
you have to enable that somehow,

1468
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,539
um,

1469
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,519
and, and you have to build that escape velocity.

1470
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:15,289
Once you build it, then your work is done.

1471
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,750
The teams will take care of the rest of it, right?

1472
00:51:18,128 --> 00:51:20,369
Um, any leader who thinks that

1473
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,409
it's gonna go exactly how they,

1474
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,309
they, they thought it, um,

1475
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,159
uh, it is, I, I would say, um,

1476
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:29,110
being naive because.

1477
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:32,349
Most likely it's not gonna go the way

1478
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:33,389
you're thinking, right?

1479
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:35,938
There's always gonna be something that's

1480
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:37,989
gonna hit you sideways when you

1481
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:38,949
least expect it.

1482
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,469
And that's where it's really important to

1483
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:43,789
be able to change direction as needed.

1484
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,159
The, the agile mindset, you

1485
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,010
know, start small,

1486
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:49,070
change direction if you need to, you know,

1487
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:51,869
absolutely change there because these are big changes

1488
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:54,228
like the transformational

1489
00:51:54,228 --> 00:51:56,188
effect on software engineering is very high,

1490
00:51:56,628 --> 00:51:58,628
but you know people are resistant, so the

1491
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:00,769
thing, the number one thing that, you know, always

1492
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:01,929
amazes me is like, you know.

1493
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:04,458
If you can cut down something from 6 months to

1494
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,708
35 minutes, uh,

1495
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,340
why, why would the organization resistant

1496
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,219
about it, but

1497
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,958
it's like people are sad in doing, uh, ways

1498
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:14,039
to start small and, and get them there.

1499
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:16,360
It's, it's changing the hearts and minds,

1500
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:18,780
right? Uh, especially over the last

1501
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,010
decade or so. Technology is no longer

1502
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:21,918
the bottleneck.

1503
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,458
Everything is possible. Anything is possible. You can

1504
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,628
do it. Um, use harness and

1505
00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:27,239
everything's possible,

1506
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:29,168
that too, of course,

1507
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,309
but it's, it's really changing the, the mindset,

1508
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:32,898
right? Uh,

1509
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:35,550
organizations implement, uh, safe or

1510
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,969
agile practices, but they don't implement

1511
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:39,119
the agile mindset.

1512
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:41,329
They implement product model,

1513
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:43,909
but they don't build the level of accountability

1514
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:46,070
that needs to come with product model. They will

1515
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,349
bring in DevOps tool chain,

1516
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,958
but they will not build, uh, bring in,

1517
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,030
uh, uh, the.

1518
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:54,500
Uh, the culture of DevOps, you build it,

1519
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,639
you own it, soup to nuts, right? They will, they

1520
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,688
will continue to operate in an operations

1521
00:52:58,688 --> 00:52:59,199
versus,

1522
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:00,898
uh, project environment.

1523
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,539
So I think changing those mindsets.

1524
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,579
And then leveraging tools like

1525
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:08,188
harness you rightfully said

1526
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:11,090
to automate and standardize the processes,

1527
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:13,099
really looking for those levers that

1528
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:14,918
will create the big waves. Yeah,

1529
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,699
definitely I think, uh, mindset is

1530
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,059
extremely important. Mindset combined with the automation

1531
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:21,639
and the tool chain. If you

1532
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:24,019
many times like it's hard to change the mindset if you

1533
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:26,260
don't give people the tool because then they say it's too hard

1534
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,159
to achieve what I want to achieve

1535
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,619
and then they won't change, uh, you know, change their approach

1536
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:32,728
so. If you combine the two and show them the path,

1537
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,179
you know, what, how you guys did it, like, you know, starting with

1538
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,188
your own internal platform engineering group and

1539
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:37,769
then, uh,

1540
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,228
moving from there. That's, uh, that, that, that, that makes

1541
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,340
sense. What advice would you give, uh,

1542
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:44,429
to people about evaluating, uh, you

1543
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,208
know, new products and tools in this space?

1544
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,550
Um.

1545
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,418
Keep going, always go in with an open mind.

1546
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,139
So when you're walking around,

1547
00:53:55,878 --> 00:53:57,978
particularly like if you're walking around the expo here,

1548
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:00,668
um. Obviously go

1549
00:54:00,668 --> 00:54:03,019
stop at the, the harness booth, check out the Squid Games,

1550
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,369
uh, the theme that they have. It's quite fun,

1551
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,030
but also, uh, wander around and, and make

1552
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,530
sure to check in at the, the tiny booths, um,

1553
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,148
you know, somebody that's still in a, a startup phase,

1554
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:15,188
that's kind of how we

1555
00:54:15,188 --> 00:54:17,449
actually came across harness, uh, many years

1556
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:19,550
ago at, uh, it was either this

1557
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,668
event or the one that's, uh, or at

1558
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:23,699
Cuban, uh, came across a harness

1559
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:25,418
booth. You're still very early on,

1560
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,409
but like.

1561
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,148
That's a great idea and you kinda

1562
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:31,188
keep tabs on them.

1563
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:32,958
At the time, uh,

1564
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:35,539
where I was, we already had a very mature

1565
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:36,239
process, but

1566
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,878
hardness always stuck in my head and when it

1567
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:41,079
came to an opportunity to be able to

1568
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,079
start anew, uh,

1569
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,619
made a call and, uh, obviously kept going

1570
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:46,199
from there.

1571
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,820
But having a, having somebody

1572
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,820
that's really willing to like

1573
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,679
be your partner

1574
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,320
in this whole process too is very

1575
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,628
important. Changing

1576
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:58,789
the entire way that

1577
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:00,010
an organization

1578
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:01,909
builds, deploys,

1579
00:55:02,188 --> 00:55:02,860
tests,

1580
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:05,429
uh, is gathering audit

1581
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,610
requirements, uh, and all of that.

1582
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,050
It,

1583
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:11,449
it's a huge deal. It's a very

1584
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:13,628
tough undertaking to really kind of

1585
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:16,570
make a big leapfrog, uh, uh, a

1586
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,769
big leap in that, in that

1587
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:19,429
space,

1588
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,030
uh, so having a partner that's kind of,

1589
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:24,688
you know, willing to, to, you know, go to

1590
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,929
the wall with you and help, uh, has

1591
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:28,148
been huge, and

1592
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:30,769
we've had that from, from your team. I know some folks

1593
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:32,889
that are here, uh, in the audience listening

1594
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:33,519
as well,

1595
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:35,889
and it's been great to work with and the fact that.

1596
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:37,539
Especially now,

1597
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:40,030
Harness has gone through it with us, we've gone through it with

1598
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,050
many others.

1599
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,898
It's good to have that experience to lean on too

1600
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:46,898
because you can't know it all.

1601
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:50,179
Yeah, a lot of, uh, a lot of large

1602
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:52,530
enterprises when they're, when they're, um,

1603
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:54,699
starting this, this journey, transformation

1604
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:57,019
journey rely on other large

1605
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:59,019
enterprises because they feel that

1606
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:01,050
they can actually help them scale, right?

1607
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,918
uh, and operate at scale,

1608
00:56:03,378 --> 00:56:04,639
um, but the challenge with

1609
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:07,340
with dealing with a large enterprise

1610
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,409
is that they are very set in their ways,

1611
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:11,659
rightfully so because they have to standardize

1612
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,519
as well, right?

1613
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:13,659
Um,

1614
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,199
but working with an organization that's

1615
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:16,708
growing,

1616
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,119
that's thinking, and, and more

1617
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,199
importantly, rethinking how things are

1618
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:21,739
done,

1619
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,500
um, where you have the ability

1620
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,590
to have a conversation and

1621
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,429
influence their road map and product capabilities

1622
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:32,119
that goes a long way because every enterprise

1623
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:33,418
has these unique

1624
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:35,878
areas that have to be catered

1625
00:56:35,878 --> 00:56:36,679
to, right?

1626
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,280
Um, and that's where our partnership,

1627
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,019
uh, with harness that that Marriott International

1628
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,239
has is, is, uh,

1629
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
really good because we can come and we can talk about,

1630
00:56:45,579 --> 00:56:46,679
hey, we have a problem

1631
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,478
and you may not have a solution,

1632
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,938
but you will come up with a solution and you will work

1633
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:53,139
with us, right? And then that solution

1634
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,219
goes mainstream and, and, and, and it works

1635
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:57,438
with others as well. That agility

1636
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:00,239
generally comes from, um,

1637
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:02,719
smaller organizations that are more innovative.

1638
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,398
And we take a lot of pride in it. And

1639
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:06,829
even as we get bigger,

1640
00:57:07,128 --> 00:57:09,530
we set up harnesses like multiple parallel

1641
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,889
startups so that we can retain that agility

1642
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:14,289
and, you know, ability to innovate very fast

1643
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:16,070
working with the working with the industry,

1644
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:17,750
working with partners. So, uh,

1645
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,119
we really appreciate the the the innovation

1646
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:21,510
partnership, uh, as well.

1647
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:23,978
