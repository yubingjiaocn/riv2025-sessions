1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
- Hey everybody, my name
is Santiago Giraldo.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,690
I am the Senior Director
of Product Marketing

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,900
for Artificial Intelligence at Snowflake.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm joined here today with Brian Neumann,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,970
who is the SVP of Engineering for Decile,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,980
one of our customers that's using

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,773
our latest innovation called
Snowflake Intelligence.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,040
So to dive right in, we
recently made an announcement

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,980
around the release of
Snowflake Intelligence

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,290
to address a very critical problem

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,420
that many enterprises face today.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,370
And that's the disparities
and the differences

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,900
between how business teams and
data teams actually operate

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,283
and work together to solve problems.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,510
Up until today, and really
I'm sure a lot of you

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,910
have experienced, that there's a big gap

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,260
between how the business
users actually utilize data

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,650
and how the data teams
actually deliver that data.

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,080
One of the big disparities that we've seen

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,300
is the fact that data
teams spend a lot of cycles

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,020
creating static reports or
reports that take a lot of time

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,970
to actually reach that insight.

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,430
And by the time that you
actually get that insight,

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,963
it's already too late to act.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,400
The solutions that we have
today tend to be very rigid

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,590
and face a lot of problems
in terms of how you actually

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,600
answer and solve problems.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,680
So as an example, today
it's very easy to ask, what?

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
It's very easy to ask,

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,523
what did my sales look like last week?

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,020
What campaigns, how did they perform?

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,850
But one of the big critical gaps here

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,940
is that those are very singular questions

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,400
that don't get at the
real crux of the problem,

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,280
which is answering the why things happen

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,860
and being able to critically
analyze and understand

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,973
what to do next.

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,360
It's hard for business
teams and data teams

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,300
to be on the same page.

40
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,400
You have fragmented data
in very disparate systems

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,257
across different databases.

42
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,060
You have siloed insights that oftentimes

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,860
are coming too late
for you to actually act

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,060
and to make decisions.

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,100
And by the time you actually get that data

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,870
and you're able to make those decisions

47
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,910
and understand what's happening,

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,310
it's already a bit too late.

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,060
So what if we changed that?

50
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,190
What if we made it
possible for every employee

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,340
across your organization to simply be able

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,370
to ask questions, do reasoning,

53
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,210
and get responses and get
solutions much faster,

54
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,530
much more quickly, and
with just a simple prompt?

55
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,630
What if we could remove the barriers

56
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,340
between these types of questions

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,090
and the insight that's required
to operate your business?

58
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,120
And then what if we take it a step farther

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,670
and say, what if you
could act on this data,

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,370
and not just the data, but
also have a reasoning partner

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,163
with you that can help
you make those decisions?

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,230
This is why at Snowflake we created

63
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,970
the Enterprise Intelligence Agent,

64
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,520
and this is what
Snowflake Intelligence is.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,620
It enables everybody from the C-suite

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,330
down to the regular business user

67
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,300
and everybody in between
to ask deep questions

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,190
of your data, and not just your data,

69
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,880
but every system across your organization,

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,880
whether that's Salesforce,
your customer platform,

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,720
all of your databases, all
of your data, securely.

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,780
And it lets you go a step further.

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,110
By using generative AI
and leveraging the power

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,520
of these varied models,
it helps you essentially

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,700
solve these problems
and ask these questions

76
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,993
that were impossible to answer before.

77
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,790
So what is an Enterprise
Intelligence Agent?

78
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,140
With Snowflake Intelligence,
there's three principles

79
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,880
that really guide and
essentially give you the power

80
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,560
to be able to make decisions in a way

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,210
that you weren't able to before.

82
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,490
First, it enables very deep analysis,

83
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,070
so it's not just asking what happened

84
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,070
or getting point-in-time results,

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,750
but it helps you reason, it
helps you ask deeper questions

86
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,330
like, what should I do next?

87
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,880
How can I actually improve my sales?

88
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,990
What are the headwinds that
are coming for my business?

89
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,610
And it lets you do deep research

90
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,593
in a way that wasn't possible before.

91
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,040
The second piece here is about trust.

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,590
So everybody understands that
with generative AI models,

93
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,550
with a lot of these innovations in gen AI,

94
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,220
it's become increasingly
difficult to really understand

95
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,490
where those answers are coming from,

96
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,460
and actually trust the results

97
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,920
and trust the decisions
that you're making.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,540
With Snowflake Intelligence,
we've enabled you

99
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,870
to have transparent and verified answers,

100
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,210
so questions that get asked oftentimes

101
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,520
can be completely verified
so you know you can trust it.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,350
And also, you have full traceability,

103
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,660
so you're not just receiving, for example,

104
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,890
a dashboard or a graph or a response,

105
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,410
but you can trace that back
all the way to the source

106
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,870
and see every piece of data that informed

107
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,530
that decision at the end.

108
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,950
And then, of course, as you all know,

109
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,190
Snowflake is really known for
their enterprise readiness.

110
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,890
All of this is native to Snowflake,

111
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,410
and it's secured and governed directly

112
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,600
inside of the Snowflake platform,

113
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,580
making sure that you don't have any issues

114
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,580
with data quality, with
security, or governance overall.

115
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,240
What we're trying to do
here is really transform

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,480
the way that you use your
enterprise data today.

117
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,030
And enable high-confidence decisions,

118
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,680
decisions you can trust,

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,050
and have essentially a reasoning partner

120
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,610
with you at your fingertips

121
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,943
that can help you make those
decisions in real time.

122
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,470
So how do we deliver this?

123
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,120
There's a couple pieces here

124
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
inside of Snowflake Intelligence

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,480
that are incredibly powerful.

126
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,510
As an example, the ability
to do dynamic discovery.

127
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,790
So again, not just looking at the graph,

128
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,370
but understanding how that graph was made,

129
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,600
having clear explanations

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,470
of the requests that you're
making, but also how it reasoned

131
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,270
and came up with a decision for you.

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,780
It enables everybody in your organization

133
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,480
to basically test assumptions,

134
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,320
to be able to explore the data,

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,960
and to develop comprehensive answers

136
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,110
that your business can
actually operate on.

137
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,060
Second piece here is, again, trust.

138
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,250
Generative AI has its challenges.

139
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,080
Everybody here knows that.

140
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,090
One of the things that we've really sought

141
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,940
and strived to do is basically create

142
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,590
an entire different culture

143
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,470
of how you operate and
use your data today.

144
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,090
What does this mean?

145
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,600
It means that you're able
to not just ask questions

146
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,030
and receive answers in
a black box kind of way,

147
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,100
but it gives you verified answers.

148
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,700
So the questions that get
asked across your business

149
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,790
essentially can be traced
back to every original source.

150
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,590
It'll reformulate the questions for you.

151
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,470
It'll give you explanations,
and everything is transparent,

152
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,550
down to the SQL queries

153
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,590
that are being produced in the background,

154
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,190
and all the reasoning
essentially completely open

155
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,450
for anybody in the organization

156
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,170
to understand how these
decisions are made.

157
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,330
It enables transparency and observability

158
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,290
through and through,

159
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,240
so that you know the answers
that you're receiving

160
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,220
are actually something that's trustworthy

161
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,643
and something that you can
actually run your business on.

162
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,700
And it goes even beyond that.

163
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,600
So, of course, generative AI,
we can ask questions of it.

164
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,010
It can give us answers.

165
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,110
But what we've enabled
here is really the ability

166
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,320
to dive even deeper inside of your data

167
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,720
and actually answer those
very critical questions

168
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,240
that were impossible to answer before.

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,070
So with things like Research Mode,

170
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,620
it lets you do deep reasoning
inside of your information

171
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,380
and all of your data across
your entire organization

172
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,300
to really ask those critical questions

173
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,740
that are forward-looking,

174
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,610
as opposed to just receiving reports.

175
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,200
It enables, essentially,
the ability for you

176
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,220
to use all your data,

177
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,180
your multimodal data,
unstructured, in a single place.

178
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,810
And it lets you ask questions
of this complex data

179
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,790
and get comprehensive answers

180
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,930
that basically take into account

181
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,123
everything that your
organization is doing.

182
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,600
In addition to that,

183
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,970
it enables you to
connect to varied sources

184
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,570
from our marketplace
to your enterprise data

185
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,530
and everything in between.

186
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,950
All of this together, so you
can ask comprehensive questions

187
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,430
with actual real insights that
take everything into account,

188
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,550
not just a single database
or a single source,

189
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,290
but everything together to enable

190
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,863
those deep questions and deep answers.

191
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,390
Basically, with Snowflake Intelligence,

192
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,250
we're enabling a new way for your business

193
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,960
to operate and work.

194
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,790
It's all of your knowledge in one place.

195
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,230
It's all of it together.

196
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,520
And it lets you ask questions

197
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,860
that were impossible to answer before.

198
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,500
And all of this, in real time,

199
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,983
at the fingertips of everybody
inside of your organization.

200
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,680
So with that, what I'd like
to do is introduce Brian here,

201
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,070
who is the Senior Vice President
of Engineering at Dessau.

202
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,750
Brian, take it away.

203
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,583
- Thanks.

204
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,980
And I just wanted to introduce
Dessau really quickly.

205
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,590
So we are an e-commerce
analytics platform.

206
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,830
And dovetailing with what
Santiago was just speaking about,

207
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,380
our mission is really
to democratize access

208
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,650
to a brand's e-commerce data
to everybody at that business,

209
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,630
from the marketers, to the
executives, to product managers,

210
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,800
so that they can generate
insights and action that data

211
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,130
without being reliant
on an in-house analyst.

212
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,740
We work with over 100

213
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,360
of the most successful e-commerce brands.

214
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,330
So a lot of the governance
and multi-tenancy

215
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,750
that comes with Snowflake
was really important to us.

216
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,643
So just kind of going through our story.

217
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,423
Before Snowflake Intelligence,

218
00:10:03,423 --> 00:10:05,430
this is kind of what
our stack looked like.

219
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,090
So we effectively bring together

220
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,610
all the data that's really
relevant to an e-commerce brand,

221
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,790
from their commerce platform,
like Shopify or Magento,

222
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,440
their marketing channels,

223
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,230
other plugins that they might be running

224
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,590
in the e-commerce platform.

225
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,510
We also pull in third-party
enrichment data from Axiom

226
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,800
to provide our customers

227
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,950
with a more well-rounded
view of their customers,

228
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,560
including demographic and
psychographic information.

229
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,800
We run all that through our
data pipeline into Snowflake,

230
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,960
where we basically create
a dedicated data warehouse

231
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
for each of our clients,

232
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,940
and have an application
experience sitting on top of that.

233
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,210
Now, our applications and the
dashboards that we have there,

234
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,870
the original intent was
really to kind of go beyond

235
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,190
the reporting that they had available

236
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,490
in their native platforms,
in their e-commerce platform,

237
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,980
or in their ESP, stitch
all that data together

238
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,810
to enable richer customer
lifecycle reporting

239
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,850
for their e-commerce brand.

240
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,480
What we notice, as we
pulled all that together,

241
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,460
is that there's a large variance

242
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,253
from how one brand operates
to another brand, right?

243
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,160
You know, we onboard some brand,

244
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,350
and maybe they have a retail business

245
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,300
running on Shopify POS.

246
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,417
They're like, "Hey,
well, let's just kind of

247
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,497
"set that data to the side.

248
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:22,740
"Let's just focus on our
e-commerce business."

249
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,370
Or they wanna go deep into
kind of product analytics,

250
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,810
but their product analytics may be sitting

251
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,950
in their commerce platform,

252
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,350
some of it may be sitting in an ERP.

253
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,660
And the more flexibility that we built

254
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,370
into our BI dashboards,

255
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,700
the more complex it
became for the executives,

256
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,020
the more non-technical folks

257
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,600
to kind of get access to those insights,

258
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,010
and they became increasingly reliant

259
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,390
on our customer success team

260
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,420
to really operate the software for them.

261
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,070
So our data analysts were kind of busy

262
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,780
developing new features,

263
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,640
kind of suturing up all the discrepancies

264
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,780
on how they might represent their data

265
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,130
on the e-commerce platform.

266
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,300
And it ended up that we basically became

267
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,083
like an outsourced data
team for our clients.

268
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,270
So the challenge for us was
we've now become the barrier,

269
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,850
just like data teams become the barrier

270
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,040
for having their executive stakeholders

271
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,070
get access to that data
in a timely fashion

272
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,280
for them to be able to get the insights

273
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,093
and activate the marketing
tactics that they'd like to.

274
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,960
So in the AI world, we
kind of took a step back

275
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,050
and we thought, how do we
remove ourselves as a barrier?

276
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,640
And once again, enable our customers

277
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,520
to really get in there and get
access to this data quickly.

278
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,770
And we started to think
about whether or not

279
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,080
we could build an AI agent

280
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,230
to basically be like
our e-commerce analyst,

281
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,290
an AI-based e-commerce analyst.

282
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,130
And we started to think about
what that would entail for us.

283
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,220
We have clients asking questions.

284
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,780
Oftentimes there's a fair amount,

285
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,640
and forgive me, probably
all of you in the room

286
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,690
have gone through this,

287
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,480
fair amount of clarification
that you need to dig into

288
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,180
to really understand their intent.

289
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,180
We really wanted to explain
what we were doing for them

290
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,130
when they asked a question and why,

291
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,930
so they could course correct if needed,

292
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,510
or at least they had
confidence in the data.

293
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,450
We wanted to make sure that we
had good monitoring solutions

294
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,790
to understand how our clients
were using the software,

295
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,440
where we can make improvements,

296
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,043
what they were expecting
out of the AI analyst.

297
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,530
Being able to evaluate and test our agent

298
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,590
as we made model updates,
as we maybe made changes

299
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,260
to some of our data representations.

300
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,010
And then ultimately, how
do we take all of this

301
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,940
and move it into a context
they're more familiar with,

302
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,640
providing visualizations and insights

303
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,190
that they could take to
the rest of their business.

304
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,230
We went off earlier this
spring, early summer,

305
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,700
and started prototyping this
against several AI frameworks,

306
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,480
and quickly discovered

307
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,210
that this is gonna be a
significant investment for us,

308
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,073
especially for a startup of our size.

309
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,800
We had to not only get the LLMs in,

310
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,960
but we had to build up the vector stores,

311
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
representing the knowledge

312
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,170
of how our brand's data was structured.

313
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,467
Brands not gonna come to us and say,

314
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,170
"Hey, I'm looking for product category X."

315
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,003
They're just gonna say,

316
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,860
"Hey, I really wanna know about jeans."

317
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,140
One client that might
be a product category,

318
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,250
another client that might be

319
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,250
how they label their
products, the product title.

320
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,330
We need to provide that
information to the LLM

321
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,693
to be able to access
the right data points.

322
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,980
We also wanted to push additional analyses

323
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,313
and brand context in, so
that the agent had that,

324
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,553
or the LLM had that information.

325
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,310
So there was an effort, basically,
about providing context.

326
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,010
We also found that the accuracy of the SQL

327
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,210
that was coming out of
a lot of the solutions

328
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,310
we were looking at was subpar.

329
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,657
And when it's returning SQL to
us, we were like, "Oh, crap.

330
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,337
"How are we gonna explain
this to a non-technical person

331
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:01,830
"when the SQL goes wrong?"

332
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,660
That looked like a challenge to us.

333
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,400
We had kind of evaluated other ways

334
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,250
to retrieve the data and provide it.

335
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,420
But then when we started falling back

336
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,640
to using some of our BI data models,

337
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,620
we were concerned that
we were gonna be limited

338
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,870
by the inflexibility of the BI models

339
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,300
like we had in our previous
reporting solutions.

340
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,190
We really wanted to have
something that provided

341
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,150
that rich, just generative SQL experience

342
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,250
so that we had full
expressivity of the SQL

343
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,220
to be able to run whatever
analysis that a client wanted to.

344
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,080
If they had a really
interesting customer segment

345
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,960
they wanted to look at,
people who purchased X twice

346
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,260
and then came back and purchased
Y a couple months later,

347
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,093
have at it.

348
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,890
You can go do that in SQL. It
was always a challenge for us

349
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,860
to kind of build those
things out into our BI models

350
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,633
in a way that was accessible.

351
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,877
And then at the end of it, it was like,

352
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:52,057
"Okay, how do we build
the evaluation harness?

353
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:53,707
"And then how do we get visualizations

354
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,160
"back into the user experience?"

355
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,540
Because at the end of the day,

356
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,580
picture's worth a thousand words.

357
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,080
So I think it was at a Snowflake
Summit last year in June,

358
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,570
we saw the announcement
around intelligence

359
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,290
and we started very
aggressively asking our rep

360
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,810
for access to Snowflake Intelligence

361
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,433
to start playing with it.

362
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,100
We felt like we were ripe
for running this exploration.

363
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,080
We already had Snowflake data warehouses

364
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,123
for each of our clients.

365
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,950
So if we were looking at
an intelligence solution,

366
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,270
we were already gonna be able to draft off

367
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,700
of all the data governance
that we had set up in Snowflake

368
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,140
for this new AI offering.

369
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,520
There wasn't gonna be an
additional lift for us

370
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,850
on that side, or very limited.

371
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,580
We also had a lot of semantic data

372
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,750
that we already had in DBT.

373
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,250
Even when we were building
this out against AI,

374
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,757
we were like, "Okay, where do we get

375
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:48,247
"the semantic information to
really feed into the models

376
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,520
"to understand how they're
pulling this data?"

377
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,237
So we had this in a DBT and we were like,

378
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:55,797
"Okay, this looks extremely
promising for us."

379
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,760
So we started to look at
what it was gonna take

380
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,980
for us to set up Snowflake Intelligence.

381
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,250
And really, there's
only a couple of things.

382
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,870
We wanted to set up a semantic view,

383
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,010
or multiple views, per client.

384
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,980
And the semantic view,
think of it as describing

385
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,320
your dimensions, your
facts, your table structure,

386
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,630
the relationships there,
and wrapping all of that

387
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,790
into descriptions, more
natural language descriptions

388
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,850
for the model to read.

389
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,850
We knew that we also
needed search services.

390
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,490
Those are optional, but for us,

391
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,220
we already, from our earlier experiences,

392
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,420
knew that when we wanted to
go into these more free-formed

393
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,700
product discovery type questions,

394
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,740
it was really gonna accelerate and improve

395
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,080
the user experience if
we had those in place.

396
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,730
And then, the agent
configuration, the instructions,

397
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,810
the model, et cetera.

398
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,040
So we started looking at our stack

399
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,403
and figuring out how we were
gonna implement all this.

400
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,150
So we started from our
DBT model documentation.

401
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,700
And so, any of you who
are familiar with DBT,

402
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,700
you've got your models,
your logical table name,

403
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,170
the description, the
columns, descriptions,

404
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,120
and data types at that level.

405
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,510
We were like, okay, this is great.

406
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,413
This is a jumping-off point
for our semantic view.

407
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,420
We're just gonna extend this.

408
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,670
We're gonna use the
MetaField feature within DBT

409
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,200
to add additional semantic information

410
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,260
that we wanted to push into Snowflake.

411
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,260
So we found aliases,
synonyms, sample values,

412
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,740
whether or not we wanted
to index a particular field

413
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,830
with the Cortex search service

414
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,240
to be able to perform fuzzy matching.

415
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,303
And we just extended all this
into our DBT model templates.

416
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,360
Easy enough.

417
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,090
From there, the semantic
views in Snowflake,

418
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,230
they're YAML files.

419
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,930
They look, if any of you
have built semantic views

420
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,340
in other tools or BI tools,
it looks very similar.

421
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,540
So we're like, okay, well, great.

422
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,490
We're just gonna build
little Jinja templates

423
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,770
on top of that to produce the YAML files.

424
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,400
So you'll see we've kind of
pulled together the manifest.

425
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,080
We'll pull it into the context.

426
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,913
And it's like, okay, well,

427
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm gonna go reference my orders model.

428
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,550
I'm just gonna pull the
description through,

429
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,500
pull the dimensions through, the facts.

430
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,770
The only things I'm really kind of adding

431
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,650
into this template that
are interesting here

432
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,290
are derived metrics.

433
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,640
I wanna run certain calculations

434
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,910
to have well-defined metrics

435
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,070
that are available
within the semantic view.

436
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,170
I think we had our relationships in here.

437
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,630
And as Santiago was speaking to earlier,

438
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,270
we also introduced verified queries here.

439
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,130
Primarily in our use case,

440
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,130
we were looking for things
that didn't quite fit cleanly

441
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,280
into maybe a derived metric definition,

442
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,280
but something that we
wanted to show the agent,

443
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,020
how do I produce this type of a query?

444
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,490
So for us, just for context,

445
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,720
it's something like retention rates,

446
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,000
where it's like, okay,
there's an initial cohort,

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,140
and there's a size of,

448
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,780
how many customers did
I bring in in March?

449
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,270
And then how many of them came
back and purchased in June

450
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,420
or in the next quarter?

451
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,590
So we provide a couple of
verified queries like that

452
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,563
in these semantic views.

453
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,530
And then ultimately,

454
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,320
kind of built this out into
our deployment pipeline.

455
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,390
So when we go to deploy into Snowflake,

456
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,770
and to build an intelligence,

457
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,470
we will run dbt, we'll
run a compile command

458
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,420
to build a manifest file.

459
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,710
We'll pull all that together

460
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,500
with our semantic view templates and YAML,

461
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,240
the agent instructions.

462
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,080
We have this little library
called DecileCortexGen,

463
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,360
which effectively goes off to Snowflake,

464
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,160
and it provisions multiple
layers of the stack,

465
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,280
from the semantic views
used by Cortex analysts

466
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,050
to the search services

467
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,690
to the agents for Snowflake intelligence.

468
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,600
So all that kind of gets
packaged up very neatly for us

469
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,750
just coming off of our
deployment pipeline.

470
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
And so here, not too many
developer days after that,

471
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,930
we basically started to have
a stack that looked like this.

472
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,790
We had our manifest file coming through,

473
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,950
we were deploying all
these into Snowflake,

474
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,800
and then through the
Snowflake intelligence UI,

475
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,060
we were able to pull
users in really quickly.

476
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,820
So for us, time to market was imperative,

477
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,550
and what we really liked
was in the Snowflake stack,

478
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,530
we could start with the UI,

479
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,800
we could pull in a couple of
our trusted client accounts,

480
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,420
people that we knew that
were kind of be familiar,

481
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,570
like kind of logging into
Snowflake, accessing intelligence,

482
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,570
and we gave them access,
oh, I don't know, July.

483
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,430
We were like, okay, let's
start playing around with this,

484
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,380
let's start iterating together.

485
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,213
I wanna start observing

486
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:42,840
what types of questions they're asking,

487
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,390
start to use that to inform
where we're investing,

488
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,310
how we're building out
our models, et cetera.

489
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,490
So they started asking
these really cool questions

490
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,990
that in the past would have been,

491
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,700
some of them would have been
more time-consuming analyses.

492
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,197
My favorite session was
one of our clients came in,

493
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:03,180
and was like, I launched a new
product earlier last month,

494
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,590
how's it performing?

495
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,130
And I was like, oh man, in
our pre-existing solution,

496
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,930
there's a couple of different
ways I would think about that.

497
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,910
You know, is it bringing in

498
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,620
like kind of a new client demographic?

499
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,450
I would go to one report for that.

500
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,710
You know, how is it reporting

501
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,630
or performing in terms of returns?

502
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,220
Okay, well, there's a
product returns report,

503
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,570
let me go look at that.

504
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,980
Let me go look at, you know,

505
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,180
whether or not these
people are coming back

506
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,400
and making another purchase.

507
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,140
Or what are they co-purchasing?

508
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,930
All those things kind of pulled together.

509
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,050
She just sat down and she
just rapid-fired questions

510
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,820
within 15 minutes, you know,

511
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,560
without having to do any sort of like

512
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,600
kind of deep diving into reports

513
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,820
to like kind of mine the insights herself,

514
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,830
or setting filters to like limit it

515
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,650
to the particular new fabric
that they had launched.

516
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,850
She had these answers.

517
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,713
That was really cool.

518
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,593
It was really cool to see that.

519
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:52,680
In the past, you know,
it would have been like,

520
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,230
ah, you know, why don't
you guys go do that for me?

521
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,530
So one of the other
pieces that kind of like

522
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,500
led to us adopting Snowflake
was the fact that they,

523
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,890
it's not just a UI, but that
they have API level access

524
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,660
at every level of the stack.

525
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,140
So, you know, the same
things that we were showing

526
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,880
in Snowflake Intelligence earlier,

527
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,630
you get all that through
the Cortex Agents API.

528
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,660
So for us, we were able
to port that experience,

529
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,930
the same experience that our
initial pilot customers had,

530
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,560
into our own application and
produce our own, you know,

531
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,630
branded e-commerce analyst,

532
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,030
AI-powered e-commerce analyst named Luma

533
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,730
as a feature within our application.

534
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,830
All again, this is just
an API integration.

535
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,540
It was sitting on top
of the same resources.

536
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,700
There was no new provisioning
that we needed to do.

537
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,820
So we were able to kind of
migrate those initial customers

538
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,540
from the Snowflake Intelligence
UI into Cortex Agents.

539
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,080
Similarly, there's like APIs
at the Cortex Analyst level.

540
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,460
So if we ever wanted to pop off

541
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,370
and maybe do inferencing in
like a different framework,

542
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,990
we could also take Cortex Analysts

543
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,303
and its text-to-SQL capabilities,

544
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,060
leverage that and, you know,

545
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,610
kind of whatever like other
kind of agentic frameworks

546
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,280
we needed to use.

547
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,570
So for us, this has been a game changer.

548
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,310
We've been able to take, you know,

549
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,800
all this information that
was previously locked

550
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,490
behind dashboards and make
it accessible to our clients

551
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,193
through a natural language chat interface.

552
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,170
I'm just gonna walk through
a little bit of, you know,

553
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,230
what this looks like for our clients.

554
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,170
So again, we've had a
couple of our clients,

555
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,563
Emily at Lake Pajamas and
Becky at Caddis Eyewear.

556
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,180
They were early pilot users for us.

557
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,710
And, you know, this is
kind of what they said,

558
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,647
that they were like,

559
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,347
"Hey, just, we weren't
doing the analysis before.

560
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,950
"It was taking us too much
time to go access the data."

561
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,870
Even when we had like kind of reports,

562
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,677
they were like, "I would
go download two things,

563
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:51,820
"try to stitch things together

564
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,180
"to really understand what was going on."

565
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,220
And they didn't have to do that anymore.

566
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,350
And their marketing channel owners

567
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,720
are now empowered to come in
and actually make those queries

568
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,777
or ask the questions
that they're looking for

569
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:05,610
and get the results back.

570
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,260
The other thing that all of our clients

571
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,140
have really highlighted in the feedback

572
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,320
is the thinking steps that
Santiago was showing earlier.

573
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,340
Being able to see what the
agent is doing in the background

574
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,830
and not just at a SQL level.

575
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,080
You can do it at a SQL
level if you know SQL.

576
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,090
But because the semantic view's in place,

577
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,807
it's like, "Hey, I'm
gonna go hit this field

578
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,390
"and I'm filtering for this."

579
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,940
Or, "I'm gonna look at
this property over here."

580
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,630
Seeing it at that level
has given our users

581
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,970
a lot of confidence that
the data that they're seeing

582
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,373
is accurate and complete.

583
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,520
I fundamentally don't think
that we would actually

584
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,900
have a product without
those thinking steps

585
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,240
because it's just too much of a black box.

586
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,240
And that natural kind of
ideation and collaboration

587
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,270
that happens when you're
actually sitting in person

588
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,560
with an analyst.

589
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,147
Like, "Oh, I asked, can I have this?

590
00:25:58,147 --> 00:25:59,677
"Go run a market basket analysis for me

591
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:00,510
"for the last two years."

592
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,077
"Oh, okay, I'll start last November."

593
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,837
"Oh, actually, we changed
our products in March.

594
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:06,787
"Let's just go back to March of 2024

595
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:08,700
"and go run that same analysis."

596
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,200
Since the thinking steps kind of shows you

597
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,120
what it's doing along
every step of the way,

598
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,180
clients come in and they
can kind of course correct

599
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,640
throughout the session.

600
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,050
And that's been great.

601
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,240
So for us, on the decile side,

602
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,720
what Snowflake Intelligence has given us

603
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,320
is really a turnkey AI framework

604
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,510
to quickly launch to our customers.

605
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,190
We're able to provide quicker access.

606
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,170
We were able to get our
product and our agents

607
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,900
in the market faster and
start building confidence

608
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,640
that we had something that was viable,

609
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,470
even before we ran through the integration

610
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,030
into our own application.

611
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,850
But because it has the
flexibility of not just the UI,

612
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,950
but all the API endpoints underneath,

613
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,780
we had flexibility going forward

614
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,490
in terms of how we might want to iterate

615
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,580
and evolve our agentic solution.

616
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,890
But already, it's reduced the stream

617
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,900
of custom analytics
reports that we're doing.

618
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,150
It's helped our users transition

619
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,970
from mining data in a report

620
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,940
to actually extracting the insights.

621
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,330
For the clients who are
already on our AI solution,

622
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,410
we see about a 75% reduction
in their support asks.

623
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,060
So they're able to come in,

624
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,200
one value pop of ours
is running segmentation.

625
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,790
They're able to come in and just express

626
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,710
what segments they do
without having to understand

627
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,990
group by logic, for instance.

628
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,967
They're just able to say,
"Hey, I wanna go find people

629
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:28,567
"who purchased the same
product three plus times

630
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,187
"over the last six months
because I want them

631
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,100
"to join my subscription program."

632
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,410
They're able to come
in, just type that out,

633
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,170
and get to a customer segment
that they can then activate

634
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,600
through our platform and
go push up to their ESP,

635
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,480
and immediately run a
campaign against them.

636
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,307
So for us, this has been a game changer,

637
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,440
and we've been really excited
to partner with Snowflake

638
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,140
on getting this product to market.

639
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,853
Roadmap on our side, like I mentioned,

640
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,460
this first step for us has been,

641
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,620
after we got Snowflake
Intelligence set up,

642
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,420
integrating with the Agents API,

643
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,420
really pulling all that experience
into our own application.

644
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,370
And again, that's
one-to-one with what you see

645
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,440
within the intelligence world.

646
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,300
Optimizing workflows
within our application,

647
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,620
making the data portable.

648
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,610
So if you saw some of the
results in the previous slides,

649
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,250
we can take a table of customer IDs,

650
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,500
effectively just click a button,

651
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,750
migrate it to a segment
within our platform,

652
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,830
and then click another button,

653
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,340
and then go sync it up to Klaviyo

654
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,433
for some sort of an email campaign.

655
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,290
Next things for us,

656
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,060
and I think this is kind
of a critical point for us

657
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,560
in terms of making this
product successful,

658
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,810
is being able to
customize the instructions

659
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,820
on a per-brand level.

660
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,740
Again, we're working with 150-ish clients.

661
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,100
It's hard for us to manage all the nuances

662
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,810
of every brand, right?

663
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,440
One brand runs a gift program
on a certain platform.

664
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,120
Others run subscriptions.

665
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
There's three or four
different primary vendors

666
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,033
on the Shopify world.

667
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,280
Wholesale, retail, how
they wanna handle that.

668
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,933
What they mean by customer value.

669
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,690
All that information is context

670
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,130
that we kind of know about the brands,

671
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,980
but being able to encode that
and push that up to the agent.

672
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,923
And then I think aspirationally,
being able to work with the

673
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,380
hands-on keyboard more employees

674
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,780
to be able to infuse those
types of instructions

675
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,440
and the context about who the brand is

676
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,380
into the agent themselves
to help inform the agent

677
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,120
what types of analyses
it should be running

678
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,800
for different types of verticals within

679
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,270
the e-commerce space.

680
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,620
And the last thing on our piece

681
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,670
is actually trying to build
scheduling and alerting.

682
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,360
Again, when we're trying to
build an agentic e-commerce

683
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,010
analyst, an analyst should be able

684
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,960
to run background tasks for you, right?

685
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,450
Wake up Monday morning,
go run anomaly detection,

686
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,610
go tell me if I have an inventory item

687
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,350
that I need to go restock.

688
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,800
Tell me if sales of a particular
product fell off last week.

689
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,850
These are things that people are doing

690
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,710
with our platform today that ultimately,

691
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,630
now that we have agents in place,

692
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,250
being able to enable our
clients to schedule out

693
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,290
on a recurring basis to be able to say,

694
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,593
go pop that up on Monday
and go give me this report,

695
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,520
just like they would if they
had a human analyst in-house.

696
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,850
So these are some of the exciting features

697
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,180
that we're looking to build
into Luma here shortly.

698
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,780
If you wanna learn more
about Luma AI by Decile,

you can go access that QR code there.

700
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,660
It'll take you to our product page.

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,360
- Okay, that's all I have for you,

702
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,090
but we did have a demo plan,

703
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,560
unfortunately it didn't work out.

704
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,660
But if you come by the Snowflake booth,

705
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,430
we'd be happy to show you
Snowflake Intelligence

706
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,330
in real time.

707
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,790
And Brian and I will be
here and be available

708
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,260
if you all wanna chat anymore.

709
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,130
Thank you all so much.

710
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,763
