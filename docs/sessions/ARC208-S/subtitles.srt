1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,120
- Good afternoon and
welcome today's session

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,540
on the topic of advancing
behavioral health analytics

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,553
with integrated cloud services.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,090
This session will step
through the journey.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,120
The Commonwealth of Virginia
has taken to implement

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,780
a modern enterprise data warehouse,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,130
to streamline data management,
improve data quality,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,750
associate individuals across
multiple health systems,

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,840
and optimize outcomes reporting

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
on critical programs serving
our vulnerable populations.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,820
My name is Bryant Jenkins.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,970
I'm the engagement manager
leading the implementation

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,700
of the new EDW platform

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,280
for the Department of Behavioral Health

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,903
and Developmental Services.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,610
I'm joined on stage with three
of our technology leaders

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,890
from Virginia and Deloitte

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,990
that helps make this transformation

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,460
to a serverless event-driven
architecture possible.

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,663
Bob Osmond, Russell
Accashian, and Don Hoag.

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,483
Gentlemen, could you please
each introduce yourselves.

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,680
- Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,230
Bob Osmond, I'm the Commonwealth CIO

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,813
and agency head for
the Virginia IT Agency.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,980
- Good afternoon, Russell Accashian,

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,480
the chief information officer

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,100
for the Department of Behavioral Health

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,080
and Developmental Services.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,930
Great to be here.

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,130
- I'm good. I got my mic, thanks.

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,460
Don Hoag, I'm the Deloitte
leader in digital health

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,590
and also am the account manager associated

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,150
with this project for Deloitte.

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,010
And I did order the extra large room,

35
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,253
but I guess we'll have to
deal with what we got, so.

36
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,220
(all laughing)

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,590
- Okay. Thank you, all.

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,140
So, now for today's agenda,

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,900
we're gonna begin with an overview

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,010
of Virginia's IT footprint,
followed by steps

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,570
that VITA has taken to transition
on-premise applications

42
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,193
to the AWS cloud.

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,220
Then we're gonna spotlight the work

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,600
that's been happening over
within DBHDS specifically

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
to rethink how data is collected,
governed, and aggregated

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,990
to support data-driven decisions

47
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,503
related to behavioral and
mental health programs.

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,073
- Hey, Bryant. you need
to advance the slide.

49
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:37,550
- [Bryant] Okay.

50
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,147
- So, states are funny
entities. We're all different.

51
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:44,040
You know, if you look at, there's 50 of us

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,090
and everyone operates with
a different type of model.

53
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,650
Virginia is a mid-size state.

54
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,070
We're smaller than Texas,
bigger than Rhode Island.

55
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,470
We serve 8.7 million citizens.

56
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,580
And as you can see, there's
67 different agencies

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,130
that we directly work with.

58
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,870
The breadth of the state
in terms of Virginia

59
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,870
recognizes the diversity
of the respective missions.

60
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,132
And so, if you think about
all the different things

61
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:16,620
that a state does, we
have entities that operate

62
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,680
museums and cultural exhibits.

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
We have groups that do public
safety, like the state police.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,060
We have groups that operate,
you know, hospital systems.

65
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,960
We have people that manage transportation.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,780
It really is a breadth of activities.

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,640
We even have a space port.

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,260
So, when you look at all
these different things,

69
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,400
you see a lot of stuff.

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,400
And, you know, we operate in
a 1,700 different locations.

71
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,270
We have a lot of data,

72
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,210
a lot of different
services that are offered,

73
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,000
and that the work that we do

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,690
at the state level follows four themes.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,690
One is the work around
commonwealth infrastructure,

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,140
so the different things

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,780
that people use to
operate their IT systems

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,250
for the agencies that we serve.

79
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,710
We provide statewide
unified cybersecurity.

80
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,730
We do governance of all kinds
of IT-related activities

81
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,563
across the state.

82
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:15,033
And then we do statewide procurement.

83
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,610
Next slide.

84
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,130
So, the operating model that we have

85
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,650
is what I call a shared operating model.

86
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,080
It's very much based around the notion

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,200
that at the enterprise we
standardize the infrastructure

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,990
so that we can unify the
different work that we do

89
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,840
in terms of the platforms
that we operate in,

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,920
the network, the end user compute
devices, the data centers.

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,360
Those are all common across
the 67 different entities.

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,300
We provide shared work in
terms of the governance

93
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,760
and the architecture
and the cybersecurity.

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,850
The work then, but that's
happening at the data

95
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,070
and the application layer
that was very much done

96
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,140
by the agencies that we serve.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,710
And so, this is what I call a
decentralized model, you know.

98
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,530
And like I said, every state
operates a little differently.

99
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,780
At Virginia, this is how we operate

100
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,040
and it's a nice way to drive
scale and standardization

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,190
on things that lend
itself to standardization

102
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,520
and also allows agencies that
are closest to their mission

103
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,710
to develop the unique
solutions and capabilities

104
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,620
that they need in order
to deliver that mission

105
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,793
as best possible.

106
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,230
So, we started our journey
really back in 2018.

107
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,230
That's when we got into
the cloud officially.

108
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,820
And I call that phase

109
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:39,510
between 2018 to 2022 our fake cloud phase.

110
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,670
And so we were in the cloud technically,

111
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,680
but we were using the cloud

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,470
really like as if it was
a private data center.

113
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,370
So, we were using EC2 clusters.
We were using storage.

114
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,080
But we weren't really
taking advantage of it.

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,870
We were treating 'them as just
another source of servers.

116
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,320
That changed around 2022
when we started looking

117
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,230
at the true opportunity
of working in the cloud.

118
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,520
And that's where we started looking

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,680
at all the different
serverless capabilities.

120
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,090
We started looking at the value

121
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,270
of how we can more fully
embrace the public cloud

122
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,620
and work together.

123
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,570
And we started with AWS.

124
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,633
There were a lot of reasons
why we led with AWS.

125
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,080
There's quite issues around...

126
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,940
It was a function of maturity.

127
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,400
It was a function around choice.

128
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,220
For example, in the private
cloud that Virginia had,

129
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,090
we offered 50-ish different
flavors of compute,

130
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,950
different types of operating systems,

131
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,950
different types of clusters.

132
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,990
In the AWS cloud, we offered 450

133
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,330
and that number is growing
and growing and growing.

134
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,410
And even this morning,

135
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,030
they announced even more different choice.

136
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,250
And so, that choice allowed us to think

137
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,810
about cloud capabilities
in a very different way.

138
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,000
Instead of moving, thinking
about it from the perspective

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,450
of a server that took
you weeks to provision

140
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,480
to a server that you can
provision in 37 minutes.

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,390
That's a very different
mindset around capabilities.

142
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,320
And now that we're looking

143
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,390
at even different types of capabilities

144
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,860
around serverless architectures

145
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,320
and different types of
capabilities in that way,

146
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,330
we're finding that there's
even a greater opportunity

147
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,840
to accelerate value and time to deliver

148
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
within the enterprise

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,300
and build out capabilities
starting with the fine work

150
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,733
being done by my colleague Russell.

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,870
- So, that's a great segue.

152
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,703
Why don't we talk a little

153
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,320
about what's happening over within DBHDS

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,063
and the challenges that
you faced when you came?

155
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,290
- Perfect. So, just to
set a little context here.

156
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,470
I probably spent about 25
years in the private sector,

157
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,510
predominantly in the financial services

158
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,013
and in some in healthcare.

159
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,520
I've been with the agency
for about two years.

160
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,760
So kind of brought in that
private sector mentality.

161
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,860
And one of the first things, you know,

162
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,840
that we looked at was, you know,

163
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,970
kind of just an agency topology

164
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,883
and really wanted to understand
kind of where we were.

165
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,630
And what we found was we had
an antiquated architecture.

166
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,450
And there's a lot of companies
out there that have that.

167
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,840
The problem that we
really kind of ran into

168
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,340
was everything in that public
sector is done in silos.

169
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,100
Everything is a funded
project with no vision,

170
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,110
no ability to look at,

171
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,010
well, how do I want to
build, you know, components

172
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,700
that, you know, I can then
continue to build on as I go.

173
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,340
And so, the first thing
that we really wanted to do

174
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,150
was begin to lay out kind of
what we wanted architecturally

175
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,590
and then kind of started with the data.

176
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,330
Everything starts with the data.

177
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,270
And so, we have 12 facilities.

178
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,210
We've got 40 community service boards

179
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,740
that support behavioral health

180
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,820
throughout the State of Virginia.

181
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,980
And then we've got
thousands upon thousands

182
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,030
of private sector supporters
of behavioral health

183
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,707
throughout the state of Virginia as well.

184
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:58,860
And so, where we're really
trying to to go is understanding

185
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,070
that an individual can go to a facility,

186
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,420
to a community service board,

187
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,330
to a private, you know, provider,

188
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,850
but there was no data
integration across the state

189
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,540
to really understand how this
individual was being serviced.

190
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,180
And so, this is where our
enterprise data warehouse

191
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,780
really began was to start
bringing all of this data in,

192
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,660
building out, you know,
a master patient index

193
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,850
where we could then
begin to track, you know,

194
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,123
the progress of an individual
through the state of Virginia.

195
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,240
We had a lot of manual processes.

196
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,010
It was hard to believe that
data was days, weeks, months

197
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,800
being delayed as you envision, you know,

198
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,910
envision a clinician or a doctor,

199
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,860
you know, servicing somebody

200
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,670
and then having to go in
and manually enter something

201
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,500
because systems weren't integrated.

202
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,420
And so, a lot of what we've been doing

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,010
over the last two years, you know,

204
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,290
as we were building
out the data warehouse,

205
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,220
you know, was beginning to
build the integration layers

206
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,450
in the cloud as well

207
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,770
so that as we begin to continue
modernizing our technology,

208
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,830
the hooks are there, the
service bus is there,

209
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,720
the data warehouse is there.

210
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,190
So, now, we are at a position

211
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,590
where we can now
modernize the applications

212
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,330
and continue to integrate

213
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,170
and really begin to move all
these manual processes away.

214
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,400
Last and least was,

215
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,470
there was zero transparency into the data.

216
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,470
Data quality across the
board was truly lacking.

217
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,370
It made it hard to do
analytics to really understand

218
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,350
where the state was, how they were moving

219
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,780
in regards to behavioral health services.

220
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,960
And so, as we sit here today

221
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,900
with millions of transactions flowing in,

222
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,970
we've really, really progressed, you know,

223
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,390
the data analytic capabilities
across the state of Virginia

224
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,100
when it comes to behavioral health.

225
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,290
And we're well positioned now

226
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,290
to really modernize our
technology and move forward.

227
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,260
So, it's been a great partnership.

228
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,850
It was a great, you know, advancement

229
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,470
for the state of Virginia.

230
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,830
And as you'll hear here later, you know,

231
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,730
we're kind of set up to now
begin integrating, you know,

232
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,120
systems across sister
agencies within the state

233
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
and that'll be something that'll be done

234
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,720
for the first time as well.

235
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,100
- That's good.

236
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,200
Let's talk about the solution itself.

237
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,150
Don, why don't you tell us about

238
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,110
what made this implementation
of the data warehouse platform

239
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,060
so novel for Virginia?

240
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,130
- And I think it was,
Russell had alluded to it,

241
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,960
and one of the things that
Russell was very clear about

242
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,860
in the beginning of this

243
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,470
and as a part of the
contracting activity was

244
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,240
we don't wanna just do things the same way

245
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,230
that we currently do them.

246
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,260
How do we expand? How
do we get to real time?

247
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,050
How do we get information in more data,

248
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,097
more accurate and complete data?

249
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:44,010
And so, that was kind of
around three big pillars

250
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,410
that I think about within
the architecture itself

251
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,910
was speed of information.

252
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,320
Can we get APIs?

253
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
Do we not just rely

254
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,190
on managed file transfer,
batch information?

255
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,440
But can we create
something that can connect

256
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,570
to these community service boards?

257
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,680
These community service boards,

258
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,040
they use electronic
health record platforms.

259
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,300
And so, integrating with them

260
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,760
and allowing them to submit
information real time,

261
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,150
utilizing cloud capabilities
to expose that secure

262
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,640
and working through key
transfer and key management

263
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,580
so that all that information
can flow very seamlessly.

264
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,160
This was the first time
that DBHDS would also get

265
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,850
accurate and complete
information at the point of care

266
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,320
that was delivered for an individual.

267
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,770
You can imagine all the files
become proprietary files.

268
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,170
The text files, they have to be submitted.

269
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,420
They get corrupted. They don't
have all the data in them.

270
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,253
You have to resubmit them.

271
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,030
Maybe they get fixed. Maybe they don't.

272
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,410
The solution was to solve that,

273
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,870
not only by still
enabling batch submission,

274
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,480
but then also through
a healthcare standard,

275
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,490
the HL7 transaction.

276
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,800
And we went through many
different facets of the pieces

277
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,990
for the discharge information,
the admission information,

278
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,970
like what has to all go into that

279
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,280
so that those community
service boards could give

280
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,560
the department a complete
and total picture

281
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
running of everything that's
happened to that person.

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,930
You can imagine in the continuum of care,

283
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,520
there are a number of things that happen.

284
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,400
It's not just you go into
a facility and you're done.

285
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,510
You know, there's many follow ups

286
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,490
that happen along that way.

287
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,810
And then the third big piece of this

288
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,730
was also federal compliance.

289
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,920
So, there are many federal
reportings through SAMHSA

290
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,690
and other organizations that are required

291
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,820
to get out to the what is happening.

292
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,497
And it's given DBHDS now
the opportunity to say,

293
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,690
"I have a better understanding

294
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,640
of not only the care
that's being delivered

295
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,780
but how much it's costing,

296
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,460
how frequently it's being delivered."

297
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,230
And we can start talking
about getting proactive

298
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,270
around that care as well
going out in the future.

299
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,710
And I'm sure we'll talk
a bit more about that.

300
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,570
But how have we done that?

301
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,700
Of course we've been focused a lot on

302
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,670
as much serverless
technology as we can get to.

303
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,590
We're trying to ingest real time.

304
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,140
We're also using Glue for
that data transparency

305
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,630
so that we can go through and
say, "Here is the metadata.

306
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,490
Here's the composition of the messages.

307
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,950
Here is the totality of the
pieces that are coming in

308
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,540
and what cycle that they come in."

309
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,550
So there is full lineage of what happens

310
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,830
for every piece, every submission.

311
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,920
We've also now begun ingesting
from financial systems

312
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,740
as well as incorporating master
data management services.

313
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,887
So, we can start looking and saying,

314
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,860
"Are these actually unique individuals?"

315
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,200
So, we're running through an
entity resolution services,

316
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,560
some other verification
functions within the platform

317
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,200
so that we can identify
uniquely each of those people

318
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,520
and then say, "Are we seeing duplicates?

319
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,620
Are we seeing, you know, rationalization

320
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,930
around all of those folks?"

321
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,240
So, that gives us a lot to
that longitudinal record view.

322
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,640
So, now, I can say not only today,

323
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,210
but this month, this year,
these last three years,

324
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,370
what has happened to you
in your entirety of care?

325
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,810
And people can go through

326
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,870
on the front end of the
application, dive into that.

327
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,070
They can drill down.

328
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,980
They can see all the
things that have happened.

329
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,120
There's a very important aspect
here around data quality.

330
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,280
Russell had mentioned a bit
about that as well as Bryant

331
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,423
of saying this transaction process,

332
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:46,020
it still inherently
has its own challenges.

333
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,230
And so, even though you
get in a record actively,

334
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,150
there may be issues with its submission

335
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,030
that you want the community
service board to fix.

336
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,130
But they need to be able
to log into something

337
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,930
and see the front end and have a dashboard

338
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,137
or something that's going to tell them,

339
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:01,800
"You've got 10 messages
that failed today,"

340
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,060
or, "You have three data elements

341
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,920
that we expected you to
fill in that you did not.

342
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,870
We're expecting you to now fix that,

343
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,750
get real time acknowledgements,
and have those come back,"

344
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,910
so it's not a month later
that the data comes in

345
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,010
or six months later if they get to it.

346
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,660
There's sort of a running track record now

347
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,457
for those community service boards to say,

348
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:21,510
"Have you fixed all the things
that we expected you to fix?

349
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,520
Does all the things balance out now?"

350
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,440
10 messages in, 8 errored out.

351
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,390
That means there's two left
you're still supposed to submit.

352
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,890
Have you submitted all of those?

353
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,000
And that running track record,

354
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,660
that learning logging process
as well is actively exposed

355
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,920
to those community service boards.

356
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,690
And they can see those things

357
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,060
so that DBHDS not only
has that transparency,

358
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,990
but so do those active and
accountable participants.

359
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,250
There's certainly any number of things

360
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,740
that we do around some
data enrichment functions.

361
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,630
There's any number of
geocoding activities,

362
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,600
some things that we do
around the diagnosis codes

363
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,980
and procedure codes that are used

364
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,750
with those people at the point of care.

365
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,040
Things that we've had to coordinate

366
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,770
and work directly with those
community service boards

367
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,170
on how is the method
of how you're recording

368
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,300
the care that is delivered
and is that consistent

369
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,220
with how the program anticipates

370
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,900
that that data is being delivered?

371
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,610
So, a lot of reference checks,

372
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,920
verifications that happen in real time,

373
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,830
and then any number of
ingestion integration

374
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,230
into the wider data ecosystem

375
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,750
that Russell wants to
maintain within the department

376
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,960
so that this particular EDW solution

377
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,060
is also one of those supporting components

378
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,780
within the larger enterprise
data ecosystem and framework.

379
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,370
So there's a number of certainly services.

380
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,420
And of course there's compute

381
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,977
and there's various other
things that go into that.

382
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,170
And we can certainly get into
any number of those things,

383
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,020
but I think there's been
an unprecedented amount

384
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,650
of information that is now
available to the department.

385
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,360
There's some exciting things to come next

386
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,650
about what they can start to do

387
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,600
with that information
now that they have it.

388
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,610
If you can imagine historically,

389
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,090
the files that they got were
actually also de-identified.

390
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,270
So they didn't even know who
those individuals per se were

391
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,060
at the, they had like a unique identifier

392
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,320
from that community service board.

393
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
Other than that, they didn't have names.

394
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,470
They didn't have anything else.

395
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,140
So some of that security rolled
into working with Bob's team

396
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,940
of how do we make sure now that we have

397
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,190
this accountability around the data

398
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,080
that we're protecting it correctly

399
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,150
and that we have everything
signed and sealed off

400
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,740
the way that it's supposed
to be transmitted,

401
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,470
and supported, and viewed by individuals.

402
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,510
But there was a lot of paving the roadway.

403
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,370
I think that I can
probably go out on a limb

404
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,570
and say that we were one of the first

405
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,610
to really start laying the groundwork

406
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,060
within this environment of how
this could and should work,

407
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,460
not only for DBHDS but also with VITA

408
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,360
and a lot of the surrounding partners.

409
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,340
- So, let's talk about teaming.

410
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,780
Right? This team.

411
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,870
What made this team in
collaboration so successful?

412
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,400
Don, why don't you lead?

413
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,130
But Russell, I'd like
to hear from you after.

414
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,139
- Yeah, I think there was a lot

415
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,810
of even just sort of
group conversations here

416
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,290
around how are we going to
set up the API structure,

417
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,100
how is that going to feed
into a common data ecosystem

418
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
and framework that's going to
be shared across applications.

419
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,240
Many Agile sessions
was really a good focus

420
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,510
for how we structured the team
to say we're going to iterate

421
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,650
and we're going to learn

422
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,620
and we're going to, you know,
review and do retrospectives

423
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,180
and come back and have new sprints

424
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,370
that are gonna create different activities

425
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,950
starting with a base foundation
of the data framework.

426
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,660
And then from there we were
able to start progressing

427
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,280
into, like, reporting and activity.

428
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,730
So, that was a lot of
agency department support

429
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,800
around data governance.

430
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,080
What are the policies
that need to be in place,

431
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,610
envisioning what that needs to look like,

432
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,430
and then how security policies
from VITA and team and others

433
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,040
are gonna mix into the
structure and architecture.

434
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,200
A lot of common design
sessions is talk about

435
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,250
what does the framework

436
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,920
and the system solution need to look like

437
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,110
so that it fits with
the architectural plan

438
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,800
but then also the proposed
solution that we had put forward.

439
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,413
So, a lot of very multidisciplinary team.

440
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,240
We have a lot of folks
who are very exposed

441
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,280
to the federal compliance angle of things.

442
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,900
People who are very data focused people,

443
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,187
a lot of technology and
architecture people,

444
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,527
AWS cloud specific people.

445
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,330
And it was, you know, definitely getting

446
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,530
a lot of those people together

447
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,600
and having a lot of good iterations,

448
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
but then also solid deliverables

449
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,900
of this is what we're putting forward,

450
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,370
this is what we're recommending, is that,

451
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,650
and then iteration from
all those people on.

452
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,120
We agree. We understand.

453
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,460
This is where we're moving with that.

454
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,540
Thoughts, Russell?

455
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,950
- Yeah, I mean I think for me,

456
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,440
the collaboration was great

457
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,890
but it was something that was different

458
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,480
from being in the private sector

459
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,970
with, you know, where
you owned everything.

460
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,960
- Right.
- You know, 'cause,

461
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,820
like you said, there
was the Deloitte team.

462
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,793
There was an AWS team.
There's the VITA team.

463
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,450
And then I brought on my
chief enterprise architect,

464
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,930
you know, upon joining the
contract was kind of in flight

465
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,770
as we joined.

466
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,710
So, a lot of the groundwork had been laid

467
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,170
and then we had to go
through those iterations

468
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,944
and the collaboration that
you were talking about

469
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:51,540
to really kind of, you know,
exploit the vision that we had

470
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,300
in regards to what we
wanted to do architecturally

471
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,030
to really advance the agency.

472
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,120
You talked about the real
time data integration.

473
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,020
It was hard to believe
that you had 12 facilities

474
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,610
that, you know, each could have anywhere

475
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,250
from 100 to 300 to 400 beds

476
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,110
and nobody knew what was going on.

477
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,280
- Right. (chuckles)
- You know, and so,

478
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,680
being able to do bed management

479
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,800
through admissions and
discharge in real time.

480
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,360
And while it sounds foolish to sit here

481
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,950
and talk about it today,
when you think about

482
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,900
how money moves and everything else,

483
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,330
that was eye-popping,
but it was the result

484
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,140
of everything being done in
silos as a defined project.

485
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,570
And so, I think this was the first time,

486
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,460
you know, for our agency

487
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,780
where there was a true
collaborative negotiation around,

488
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,640
all right, what is our vision

489
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,410
and where do we really want to go?

490
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,850
So that was, for me, you know,
it was a true appreciation

491
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,580
for what Deloitte brought to the table,

492
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,200
what our AWS partners brought.

493
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,960
And then, you know,
without VITA, you know,

494
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,200
being there to support us along the way,

495
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,370
we would not have, you know,

496
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,190
been able to get this program
out the way we did, so.

497
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,860
- And we did undertake
an AWS review as well

498
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,380
in multiple stages of the architecture,

499
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,490
the proposed direction

500
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,920
and made sure we were
bouncing things off of them

501
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,850
of what we were doing

502
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,200
and how they thought that that lined up

503
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,180
either with particular services.

504
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,220
There was definitely a
financial operations,

505
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,430
a FinOps structure to this
to say, does this match up

506
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,487
to what our anticipated burn
and budget was expected to be?

507
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,290
And are there things
that we have to adjust

508
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,030
around how we're going to ingest data

509
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,640
or how we utilize that
information or those services

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,130
to align with the budget and the plan?

511
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,440
So, there was a lot of
kind of back and forth

512
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,930
to make sure that all lined
up that particular way.

513
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,840
And then a lot of requests
from, like, Bob's team

514
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
of, like, do we have the right access?

515
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,230
Do we have the right
people who have access?

516
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,330
And do we know what those
roles are supposed to be?

517
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,550
And do we make sure that
those roles are only using

518
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,810
the things that they're supposed to use?

519
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,150
So, it was a, you know, continues to be.

520
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,860
We've gone live.

521
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,160
We have had two of the
phases completed so far.

522
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,360
We are in production.

523
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,605
We do have two more phases

524
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,480
that are going with
additional data sources

525
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,330
and additional services
that are coming through.

526
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,100
So, those are some more
features to come up,

527
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,230
but we continue to even iterate now

528
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,600
and make sure that we're keeping
and maintaining that spirit

529
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,723
of learning from all the
things that we're doing.

530
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,813
- And so, this journey,

531
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,590
as we kinda lead into the
panel discussion here,

532
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,100
this journey was years in the making

533
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,270
when we actually started

534
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,870
with laying the infrastructure
components, Bob,

535
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,080
that, you know, your
team and you helped lead

536
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,110
to the implementation of
the data warehouse itself.

537
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,900
I think as we head into
kind of the questions

538
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,753
that I'm gonna ask you here
in this panel discussion.

539
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,100
I think, Bob, maybe
this is to you first is,

540
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,710
you know, from that initial vision, right?

541
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,750
How did you get,

542
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,860
like, how did you get forward?

543
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,290
What was the next step from the vision

544
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,113
to making some forward progress
to achieve that vision?

545
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,990
- You know, I think it
starts with having a vision.

546
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,070
I mean, having a leader
in an agency like Russell

547
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,650
to come in and bring in that background

548
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,650
from the private sector and say
that I have a different idea

549
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,180
of how we should be operating.

550
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,240
You know, if you look at
state government in general,

551
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,950
it tends to be a little stale

552
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:18,000
and people know what they know.

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,570
And many places within state
government people have been

554
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,340
in position for 20, 30, I mean, 40 years.

555
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,030
You know, I had one
person who hit 55 years,

556
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,313
which is just incredible, you know.

557
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,340
And so, they don't necessarily know

558
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,810
what they don't know.

559
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,500
And so, you need to
have people that come in

560
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,770
to have an alternative view

561
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,250
on how to accomplish the
mission much more effectively.

562
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,857
And they can serve as a catalyst
to the enterprise to say,

563
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:52,140
"How do we do things differently?"

564
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,870
Because otherwise, for someone at my level

565
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,490
who's trying to provide capabilities

566
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,800
that are then consumed by the agencies,

567
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,020
I am innovating for
the sake of innovating.

568
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,680
I need a partner in the
agencies who can lead the charge

569
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,030
and really push ahead

570
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,770
and say that there's a
different alternative

571
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,320
that we have to accomplish that mission.

572
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,360
And so, you know, we were really lucky

573
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,680
to find that in Russell.

574
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,513
So, he brought that.

575
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:17,190
That pushed us to then step forward

576
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,680
and say, "Now, how do we
meet that demand signal

577
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,060
that's now been given

578
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,100
and how do we work
together in order to do it

579
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,250
in a safe, effective,
secure way, you know,

580
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,307
to really advance the
state of the art forward?"

581
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,680
- Russell, what do you think about that?

582
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,480
What was your experience like

583
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,310
before entering state government

584
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,740
and how did that change when you did?

585
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,920
- You know, I kind of touched
on it earlier, you know,

586
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,830
for the organizations that I
managed in the private sector,

587
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,600
you owned everything.

588
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,160
So, life was easy, you know,

589
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,793
in regards to the inner
organization collaboration.

590
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,750
Innovating here was exciting for me

591
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,300
because it was a new challenge

592
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,980
and it really started with you changing

593
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,930
the culture of thinking,

594
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,570
you know, really working
across multiple agencies

595
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,960
and getting, you know, people
to see things differently,

596
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,660
to see how, you know,
technology wasn't a burden,

597
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,230
but an enabler and really
kind of driving that home.

598
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,760
And then really over the last
two years as we have moved

599
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,947
so many workloads out to
AWS when everyone said,

600
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,770
"You can't do that."

601
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,080
You know, that was the
first thing when I joined

602
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,360
was everyone was like,
"You're not gonna do that."

603
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,940
And that's always been my challenge is

604
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,740
as soon as you tell me
I can't do something,

605
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,990
that's what we're gonna get it done.

606
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,480
And it's just around,
you know, leading people,

607
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,300
you know, down a path where,
you know, you empower them,

608
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,060
you teach them, you mentor them.

609
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,710
And really it was, like I said,

610
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,670
it was really around teaching people

611
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,110
how to think differently

612
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,080
to drive that modernization,
to help them see

613
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,030
what they really wanted
to see in the systems

614
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,280
because, you know, they had
been doing it for so long

615
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,690
that they had blinders on.

616
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,523
- Yeah.

617
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,680
And Bob, I mean, back to you, I mean,

618
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,120
any other points you'd have
for other states or agencies

619
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,970
that are looking at similar
modernization goals?

620
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,410
How do you get them started?

621
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,630
- I think it's always hard
to be first, you know.

622
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,780
And for someone to kind of break the ice,

623
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,970
start moving forward, it seems,

624
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,070
I mean, the cloud seems
so scary in a lot of ways.

625
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,630
I know this is fairly common

626
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,400
probably for a lot of people
in the audience there.

627
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,950
They're probably well
along their cloud journey,

628
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,630
but when the state government,

629
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,360
where people are used to
operating a certain way,

630
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,860
they have these internal barriers

631
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,720
on reasons why they can't do it.

632
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,590
And so, this is where we
look at agency leadership,

633
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,080
enterprise leadership,
industry leadership, you know,

634
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,737
from like Deloitte and
others to come in and say,

635
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:41,880
"You know, there's a different
way of getting this work done

636
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,830
and we're holding ourselves back

637
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,900
and so we need to step forward, you know."

638
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,090
And that's where
leadership really comes in

639
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,820
to where leaders really know the way,

640
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,190
they show the way, they go the way,

641
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,680
and really don't accept no for an answer.

642
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,150
I mean, you have to be stubborn.

643
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,850
You have to say, "Hey, we're
gonna do this," you know,

644
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,790
and, you know, and the
fact of the matter is.

645
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,460
And then once you accomplish
it, then it's done.

646
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,890
And then it's no longer
a first of its kind

647
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,360
within the state.

648
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,490
It's something that is normal.

649
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,620
And so, we recreate that new normal.

650
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,270
And then what's exciting

651
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,360
is not just what's happening
at DBHDS at that agency,

652
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,300
but it's what's happening around DBHDS.

653
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,510
And this is other agencies
because we all talk, you know.

654
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,010
We're a pretty chatty bunch, you know,

655
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,410
the state agencies get together

656
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,741
and we talk about each other quite a lot

657
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:34,687
and learning from each
other and trying to say,

658
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,020
"Hey, you know what, maybe
I could try this too.

659
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,620
Maybe that I'll take a risk
and do something differently

660
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,440
and try to take advantage of
some of these technologies

661
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,550
that maybe, you know,

662
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,250
the enterprise is not
necessarily a challenge,

663
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,130
that it is possible to innovate at scale."

664
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,430
And once services have been
approved, that's been secured,

665
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,380
we've shown that pattern

666
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,690
that now we're just talking
about replicating it, you know,

667
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,270
and then it becomes a
little bit much more common.

668
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,820
And then as you bring
technologists together

669
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,170
and they start looking at these ways,

670
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,030
it becomes a lot more exciting.

671
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,250
And 'cause who really
wants to do the same thing

672
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,083
over and over again?

673
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,000
This becomes a whole
new area of innovation.

674
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,030
And I think that's where
the excitingness comes from

675
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,620
in a lot of what we do.

676
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,880
- Yeah.

677
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,830
Let's switch to tooling for a second.

678
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,870
I know, Russell, we've
had many discussions

679
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,300
around the right tools and products

680
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,660
to be applying in our implementation
of the data warehouse,

681
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,060
but kind of what were some of the things

682
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,890
that drove you to make decisions

683
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,890
around COTS versus SaaS versus
custom and native services?

684
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,390
Can you speak to that bit?

685
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,810
- I mean, I think, you know,
first and foremost, you know,

686
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,013
typically you look for those
revenue differentiators.

687
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,290
That's where your secret sauce is.

688
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,123
Those are the things

689
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:52,980
that you're gonna kind
of build on your own.

690
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,450
Those things that, you know,

691
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,453
are just kind of standard
across the industry.

692
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,930
I know, you know, we
leveraged, you know, Mirth

693
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,750
to do a lot of our, you
know, data translation.

694
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,650
You know, it just made
sense from that perspective.

695
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,650
Obviously, you know, using
Snowflake as our data warehouse,

696
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,590
as we talk about the
interagency collaborations,

697
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,190
there's a lot of chatter now
around the data clean rooms

698
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,960
and how we can begin sharing data

699
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,710
across the agencies in a
safe and secure manner.

700
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,497
So, that's where we're now
enabled with that, you know,

701
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:32,760
the data lake journey with
the AWS services, you know,

702
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,940
where we get, you know, full-blown,
you know, ODS out there,

703
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,250
up and running is gonna be great.

704
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,673
So, from that perspective,
we really wanted to stay,

705
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,610
you know, as cutting edge as we could

706
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,663
with our AWS, you know,
services and capabilities,

707
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,180
you know, the event-driven architecture

708
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,910
that, you know, we're kind
of doing in partnership

709
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,030
with you all is really going to enable us.

710
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,610
We got change data capture
capabilities, you know,

711
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,210
on the docket to really
kind of drive, you know,

712
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,520
how fast we can move data, you know,

713
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,430
throughout the state when it
comes to health information.

714
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,640
And really all of this kind
of sets us up for the future

715
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,500
of a health information
exchange, you know,

716
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,520
in the state of Virginia

717
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,730
where we can really,
really, you know, empower,

718
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,470
you know, how people are treated

719
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,330
and serviced across the state.

720
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,390
- Thank you. So, we have to talk about AI.

721
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,090
Don, why don't you reflect
on kind of what's ahead

722
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,280
with how we could be
looking to incorporate

723
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,980
artificial intelligence in this solution?

724
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,090
- Yeah, I think that a lot
of the initial focus had been

725
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,800
on how do we get to the data

726
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,540
and then how do we enable the department

727
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,980
to start analyzing the data?

728
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,700
So, AI had not been a real
strong focus from the outset,

729
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,760
but now I think that the
agency is starting to realize

730
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,230
that there is a lot of information.

731
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,510
There's a lot of very detailed information

732
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,610
and how can they use that.

733
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,930
For any of you who are

734
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,870
sort of the health tech care
standards nerds in the room,

735
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,000
like the HL7 structure itself,

736
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,670
the evolution into fire is
continuously changing as well.

737
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,560
It's continuing to evolve.

738
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,620
And as we start moving into
maintenance mode associated

739
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,937
with the data warehouse and the ingestion,

740
00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:10,560
the integration engine,

741
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,420
those things will also need
to continue to maintain

742
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,700
and keep up with those
changes as they occur.

743
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,740
And so part of the maintenance
and operations process,

744
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,540
start of the process of looking

745
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,180
at how those changes
are evolving is using AI

746
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,530
to help with the coding process,

747
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,170
to keep pace with those changes.

748
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,730
Whether it's from the companion guides,

749
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,590
whether it's from the
implementation guides,

750
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,840
whether it's from the
evolving standards themselves,

751
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,630
to then say we can automate
the addition of fields

752
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,520
in the EDT message.

753
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,510
We can automate those fields

754
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,430
coming from the community service boards

755
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,740
because they're going to
review them every year

756
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,390
and start looking at what
additional information

757
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,010
or what changing information are they.

758
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,960
So, how do we enable AI to support that

759
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,080
and speed up the automation process there?

760
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,050
The second thing as well that
we're also looking at now is,

761
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,450
with that unprecedented information,

762
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,390
the department can start to
become much more proactive

763
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,680
of looking at that and saying

764
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,350
generation of alerts in
the continuum of care

765
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,060
and saying, "This person
has been readmitted.

766
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,070
This is the third time
in the last six months

767
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,300
that they've been readmitted.

768
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,130
We're seeing that these specific symptoms,

769
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,690
these specific triggers,

770
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,000
and now we can say we
have particular facilities

771
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,650
that we can start looking
at proactively saying

772
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,140
treatment patterns and
things for those individuals

773
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,510
can happen because of the
sheer amount of information

774
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,890
that's available about them

775
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,270
and the treatment that's happening."

776
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,740
So, I think I'm very excited.

777
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,000
I hope the department's very excited,

778
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,170
about now starting to get out

779
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,270
in front of these things
that are happening.

780
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,670
I think that also helps the
department start looking at,

781
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,620
how much do those services cost?

782
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,910
Do they have a good understanding

783
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,330
of what drivers are behind
procedures and diagnosis

784
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,340
and state hospitals
and services that drive

785
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,430
what those costs are going to be or are

786
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,263
and that sort of things

787
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:45,060
that they can start predicting
out, doing budget forecasting

788
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,710
and using AI to start looking at that

789
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,780
of where are they seasonal variations,

790
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,130
where are there other
things that are driving

791
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,290
what some of those particular areas are.

792
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,630
So, I think it's an exciting world now.

793
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,420
We've talked a bit more
about how we can use prompts

794
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,870
and various things within
chat box functions for people

795
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,690
who are asking questions about
the analytics themselves,

796
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,100
the drivers behind the metrics,

797
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,780
the number of people that are within it,

798
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,050
without having to physically
code or drag and drop in,

799
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,750
you know, semantic layers for BI systems.

800
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,600
And I know, Russell, you and
I talked a long time ago about

801
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,630
how can we start enabling some
of these models that have,

802
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,270
through these APIs can
create and generate alerts

803
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,530
that immediately go out from them

804
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,420
and they can be embedded in any system.

805
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,190
It doesn't have to go to the warehouse.

806
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,320
The warehouse serves as
that function of the data

807
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,270
and then the things that it finds,

808
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,550
it can create alerts to other systems.

809
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,690
It can send alerts out

810
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,790
to, you know, care measures or otherwise.

811
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,710
And so I think there's a
lot of great possibilities

812
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,930
that we're just on the cusp of.

813
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,060
- [Bryant] Bob, anything
you wanna add to that?

814
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,959
- No, I'm good.

815
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,559
(all laughing)
- Russell. Okay.

816
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,853
- One other area that, you know,

817
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,440
we actually partner with one
of the local universities

818
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,727
to actually write the
curriculum for the course.

819
00:33:56,727 --> 00:34:00,030
And there's usually about
six to seven students

820
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,960
that are in this advanced course.

821
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,660
This is our recruiting pipeline.

822
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,690
This is how we're bringing in
the new talent that we need.

823
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,300
And so, this semester that just wrapped up

824
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,660
and they just actually
presented to us last week,

825
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,660
was using agentic AI to actually
improve overall metadata

826
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,700
as we're bringing, you know,
data into the data warehouse.

827
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,480
So that will be a component
that we actually get to keep

828
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,500
within the agency.

829
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,830
So, semester over
semester, they get to build

830
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,980
new innovative solutions for the agency

831
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,020
and then we get to hopefully hire

832
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,170
those very smart young
adults into our agency

833
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,663
and keep our talent
pipeline moving as well, so.

834
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,820
- [Bryant] Keep the mic.

835
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,940
Let me ask you now to rewind this back to,

836
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,830
if you had to go through this journey

837
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,900
from the start all over again,

838
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,570
what advice would you
give for other agencies

839
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,060
trying to pull together
the right partners,

840
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,970
the right resources, the
right funding channels

841
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,153
to assemble a team to take
on such an initiative?

842
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
- I think, first and foremost,
you know, for me, you know,

843
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,400
I have a very large network

844
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,050
and it was about bringing in people

845
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,500
that wanted to do something
different in their careers.

846
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,200
And we'd all been at the grind, you know,

847
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,520
at Fortune 500 companies.

848
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,330
We've been modernizing for decades now.

849
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,670
And, you know, I kind of joked, you know,

850
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,500
with the leaders at the agency

851
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,440
that I felt like it was
time that I gave back.

852
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,250
And so, I think it's really
around how do you bring in

853
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,330
a team of individuals that
wants to change something.

854
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,103
And so, that was, you know,

855
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:44,850
I think I was two months
into my role, you know,

856
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,920
Bob was rolling out some cloud stuff

857
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,667
and I sent him an email and I said,

858
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,070
"I've got some thoughts."

859
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,230
And so, he was like,

860
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,030
and this was over the Christmas holiday-

861
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,020
- And then it began.

862
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,100
- And then it began, yeah.
(panelists laughing)

863
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,240
And he said, "Let's meet
that first week of January."

864
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,910
And it went in and it felt
more like an interview.

865
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,870
- Yeah.

866
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,140
- And so, it was really
me laying out the vision

867
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,490
of kind of what I wanna do.

868
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,830
So, I think in anything that you do,

869
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,230
you have to have a vision,
then you have to have people

870
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,587
that understand your vision
and wanna be a part of it,

871
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:20,070
and then people that can
actually build a strategy

872
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,110
and then go execute on it.

873
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,460
And then it's around motivating.

874
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,670
I mean, this journey when we
were, you know, building out,

875
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,530
you know, what our
future architecture was,

876
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,440
what our, you know, roadmap
for modernizing was,

877
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,170
we were, you know,
upskilling all of our staff.

878
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,980
I mean, we had, you know,
within the first six months

879
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,294
of starting this journey,
there were over 60 individuals,

880
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:44,850
you know, that had received
numerous AWS certifications.

881
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,510
I had never seen anything like
that in the private sector.

882
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,950
People were excited, you know.

883
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,830
For the first time, it was
like we were not only building

884
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,510
a modernization roadmap,

885
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,130
but we were building a career roadmap

886
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,860
for people, you know, and individuals

887
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,840
of how they were gonna
advance their careers.

888
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,000
And so, I think it was
just building that energy.

889
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,370
And then as Bob had indicated, you know,

890
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,070
we work closely together
with our sister agencies

891
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,010
and really everybody is
now beginning to see.

892
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,770
And these components that
we're building division

893
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,237
is reusability, you know.

894
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:17,220
And we really want to
be able to start laying

895
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,740
all of this stuff out, you know,

896
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,110
so that other agencies can
come along and leverage it

897
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,060
and begin to move faster, you know,

898
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,920
within the state of Virginia.

899
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,080
- And I was gonna to add on
just a little bit to that,

900
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,340
'cause you talked about reusability

901
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,370
and one thing that we didn't
get too far into earlier was

902
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,100
you mentioned Mirth and kind
of the integration engine.

903
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,560
And part of that process
is of course you have APIs,

904
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,740
the EHRs, they submitted
those HL7 messages.

905
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,090
Mirth is an integration engine,

906
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,210
processes them and does
all the acknowledgements

907
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,130
and various things that
come out that process.

908
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,710
But the core of that is that it outputs

909
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,070
what is the finalized,
cleansed, you know, message

910
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,350
that is going to be stored in an S3 bucket

911
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,140
and then made available
to DBHDS as the whole

912
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,750
for various applications as
well as the data warehouse.

913
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,600
And I remember, you know,
very distinct conversations

914
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,750
with Russell of, okay,
I may not like Mirth.

915
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,100
I know it's a commercial product.

916
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,420
Like, fine, it is what it is.

917
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,540
As long as it is encapsulated in its thing

918
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,010
and it's API enabled,

919
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,200
and that way at any point
in time if I need to,

920
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,330
I can replace it with
something else, right?

921
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,790
I can take constituent parts of this

922
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,950
and allow it to be future-proof

923
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,290
so that if things change
and evolve over time,

924
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,090
I'm not locked into something

925
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,520
that these services, this
enablement is going to allow me

926
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,150
to evolve and grow and
change with this over time,

927
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,170
versus the pain of, like,

928
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,700
oh, I'm locked into this specific tool,

929
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,410
or I'm locked into licensing for something

930
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,390
and now it's gonna, I
have to keep it that way

931
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,230
because that's what it is.

932
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,600
And I think that was a really
big theme that we worked on

933
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,430
when you talked about tools and software

934
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,440
and structure and architecture.

935
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,540
And I think we've gotten
ourselves a pretty good way

936
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,950
down that path to keep it

937
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,700
as much to that as we can.
- Yeah.

938
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,010
- [Bryant] What other challenges
did you hit along the way

939
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,800
that others might benefit from navigating

940
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,600
in their implementations?

941
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,610
- Well, I think a little bit
of, at least in my opinion,

942
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,320
was some of the unknown.

943
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,360
There wasn't a specific template.

944
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,660
I mean, we had our
suggestion, we had our pathway

945
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,830
that we were gonna move forward with

946
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,020
and sort of working through with VITA

947
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,280
of, like, where do we set it up?

948
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,900
How do we make requests?

949
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,850
How do we define the
roles that are for those?

950
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,210
A lot of that had not really
been done at this scale before.

951
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,270
And so, for DBHDS, for us,
for VITA, it was a, like,

952
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,520
we need to talk about how
we do all of those things.

953
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,320
And if we're in certain environments,

954
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,380
only certain DBHDS architects
are gonna have access

955
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,300
at an administrator level to those things

956
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,740
and our team would not.

957
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,090
So, then how does the handoff of,

958
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,710
there's an issue, who do I call?

959
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,000
Or how do I put in a ticket?

960
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,230
And so, many of those things

961
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,820
had not been defined or decided yet.

962
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,673
And we were all learning
along the way to get to that,

963
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,240
you know, that sort of was what it was,

964
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,710
wasn't necessarily
anybody's fault or anything,

965
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,350
but it was, we gotta
all get on the same page

966
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,030
and have lots of conversations around,

967
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,380
it's not gonna just be us.

968
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,140
As more things come as
other projects happen,

969
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,480
as other things happen
with VITA and with DBHDS,

970
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,440
they're gonna need these too.

971
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,900
So let's establish those patterns now

972
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,920
and sort of cement them

973
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,480
of how we think they're going to work.

974
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,313
- [Bryant] Yep.

975
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,200
So, what's coming up next?

976
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,800
Bob, why don't you take that?

977
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,390
What's ahead for VITA?

978
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,530
- Sure.

979
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,570
You know, as we talked about earlier,

980
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,720
the idea is that we
want to create patterns.

981
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,433
We want to create different
solutions and, you know,

982
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:28,080
and in the way citizens
experience state government,

983
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,760
they don't experience
it through an agency.

984
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,950
They experience it as a problem set

985
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,270
that they're trying to solve against.

986
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,880
And so, you look at the
challenges that we have

987
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,400
and there are some real
challenges out there, you know,

988
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,860
and one of the things
we're combating right now

989
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,700
is the use of opioids,
you know, substance abuse.

990
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,340
And unfortunately, there's a
lot of it out there, you know.

991
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,610
And so, you look at at how do we tackle

992
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,870
some of these problems

993
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,810
that are really not
single agency problems?

994
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,550
And what we have found
was that there needs to be

995
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,800
a structure to provide solutions

996
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,870
that can pull in multiple
agencies together,

997
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,590
'cause agencies are really good
about doing agency missions.

998
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,993
I mean, they're optimized
for those missions,

999
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,070
but when you want to elevate
a problem to a higher level

1000
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,870
and say, "You know, we
have something, an issue

1001
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,990
that's really spanning
across multiple agencies,

1002
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,440
then it becomes a little bit
more of a challenging set."

1003
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,980
And so, this is an example of a solution

1004
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,440
that we've developed separate from DBHDS,

1005
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,310
even though DBHDS is one of
the participating agencies

1006
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,460
working with our partners
at Deloitte to build out

1007
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,390
a substance use disorder,
an abatement platform.

1008
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,070
It's called SUDA

1009
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,650
but this pulls in data
from 10 different agencies.

1010
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,110
It puts together into
different visualizations

1011
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,270
to understand, and it's designed

1012
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,220
to really serve the frontline workers

1013
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,690
that are throughout the state,

1014
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,600
people that are operating
in law enforcement,

1015
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,240
people operating in behavioral
health and social services,

1016
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,450
and people operating in the localities

1017
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,150
at all these different levels
to give them information

1018
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,120
to understand what is going on statewide.

1019
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,470
And so, there you're able to
see usage around substance use,

1020
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,200
you're able to understand
trends and patterns.

1021
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,133
It looks at data.

1022
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,550
Nothing like this exists in the nation.

1023
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,850
And so we're very proud of
the work that we're doing.

1024
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,150
And the thing is about
creating solutions like this

1025
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,640
is that once you've done
it, you can do it again.

1026
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,990
Because there are other challenges

1027
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,850
that are multi-agency challenges,

1028
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,120
challenges around workforce development,

1029
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,300
challenges around education,
challenges around permitting,

1030
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,460
challenges around putting people to work

1031
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,800
and business development and
all these different things

1032
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,420
that are critically important.

1033
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,360
All the things you need to create a state

1034
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,870
that is the best place to
live, work, and raise a family.

1035
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,360
Those are all the things that
citizens really care about.

1036
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,010
And so, they don't care about

1037
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,080
what agency is doing a particular thing.

1038
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,290
And so, as we look at how to
elevate these conversations

1039
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,640
and elevate these solutions,

1040
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,040
I think that's where
there's a lot of opportunity

1041
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,390
for us to do better.

1042
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,230
And so, using platforms
like AWS to kind of serve

1043
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,870
as that foundational technology,

1044
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,910
having leaders like Russell here

1045
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,780
to talk about different ways
of doing things differently

1046
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,850
to really explore the boundaries

1047
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,120
of what we're capable
of doing and find people

1048
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,940
that are willing to look
at a bigger mission.

1049
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,800
You know, that's why people
come to state government.

1050
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,000
It's really all about the mission.

1051
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,400
We care about our
neighbors and our friends

1052
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,057
and the people we live and work with,

1053
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:33,480
and we wanna do better for them.

1054
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,070
And so, that's what makes state government

1055
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,333
really, really exciting.

1056
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,780
- [Bryant] I agree. Thank you.

1057
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,523
Folks, we've left some time
to ask your own questions.

1058
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,340
For those of you that
are also on this journey

1059
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,470
of innovation, if you have questions,

1060
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,610
I think we've got a mic set up

1061
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,053
or we have a runner
here, so please ask away.

1062
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,150
- [Audience Member] Yeah, I'd love to hear

1063
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,090
a little bit more about how you,

1064
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,280
you said earlier that
you're bringing in sources,

1065
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,630
not just from different agencies

1066
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,140
but also maybe even private
practices and things like that.

1067
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,077
How do you deal with some
of the sharing information

1068
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:20,490
and the legality of that?

1069
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,270
How did you navigate the
kind of the constraints

1070
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:29,270
around sharing data, health
data across different groups?

1071
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
- Want to take that.

1072
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,440
Yeah, that's a difficult one there.

1073
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,840
It's interesting coming
outta the private sector

1074
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,760
and understanding, you know,

1075
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,330
all the data rules and regulations.

1076
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,720
It's magnified at the state level.

1077
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,490
And so, these data clean rooms

1078
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,190
that I mentioned earlier
is one of the areas

1079
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,630
that we're moving into where,
you know, we can really begin

1080
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,630
to control who has access
to what levels of data.

1081
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,470
That's one aspect.

1082
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,220
The other things that we are doing is

1083
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,157
there's a lot of data work

1084
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:10,680
and anonymization that's happening

1085
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,150
across the agency as well
where we've been able

1086
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,460
to, you know, work with
the universities once again

1087
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,630
to introduce noise into
data sets to really begin

1088
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,090
to anonymize, you know, the data

1089
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,440
from that perspective as well.

1090
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,490
And then that way we've also built out

1091
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,510
using AWS a data synthetic generator,

1092
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,170
so we can literally take true data sets

1093
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,870
and then mock them up in a way

1094
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,840
where I can completely scrub the data

1095
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,820
but still leave it in its normal state

1096
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,740
so you can do analytics on it.

1097
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,070
So, that's another avenue
that we've gone down as well

1098
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,480
to kind of begin to safely
share data out, you know,

1099
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,423
across, you know, our
sister agencies as well.

1100
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,360
- Yeah, also-
- Thank you.

1101
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,620
- At the point of ingestion,

1102
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,420
since we have unique submitter IDs

1103
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,460
based on the community service board,

1104
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,620
we also have very
definitive security roles

1105
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,900
within the ingestion process to identify

1106
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,820
who they're aligned to and
who they're associated with,

1107
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,160
because those are the parties
that are also allowed to see

1108
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,470
that particular detail level information.

1109
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,910
So, all of those are also built in

1110
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,920
to all of the downstream processing.

1111
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,390
It's associated with the data

1112
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,610
everywhere from, you know,
the point that it's ingested

1113
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,450
to the point that it's dropped

1114
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,770
to the point that it's made available

1115
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:29,220
into the synthetic or
into the semantic layer,

1116
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,260
and then as well into the end dashboards

1117
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,280
that people are able to see.

1118
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,220
So, that community service
board can only see their members

1119
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,350
and who they're aligned
to and then the messages

1120
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,690
for a certain period of
time that go back for them.

1121
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,370
So, there's a lot of
role-based access work

1122
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,590
that goes into that at the message level.

1123
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,510
- Yeah, and just to,
one of the other things

1124
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,430
that we didn't touch on here today was,

1125
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,680
through this data warehouse journey,

1126
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,963
the agency was rolling
out data governance.

1127
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,830
And so, while most of you
all have probably, you know,

1128
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,980
rolled this out, you know,
in your professional careers,

1129
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,380
there was no concept of
a data owner, a steward,

1130
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,357
or a custodian at the agency.

1131
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:05,430
And so, data governance was rolled out

1132
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,230
over the last two years as well.

1133
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,948
And we are now using the universal,

1134
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:12,600
the SageMaker Universal Studio

1135
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,570
to begin building out data
dashboards for the data owners

1136
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,970
to understand not only data quality,

1137
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,130
but that's gonna be the
governance mechanism

1138
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,070
of who they can actually provide access

1139
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,720
to their data sets as well.

1140
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,300
So that's just one of the mechanisms

1141
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,500
that we've done as well.

1142
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,110
- Just wanna add a little bit to it.

1143
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:35,640
I do want to assure everybody
that the security of data

1144
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,950
is really important, you know.

1145
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:42,077
And so, we're regulated by a
number of different bodies.

1146
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,480
There's HIPAA data that's
regulated, you know,

1147
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,740
health and human services data.

1148
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,200
There's CJIS data, which
is criminal justice data

1149
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,480
that regulates our law
enforcement agencies.

1150
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,920
There's FERPA data that
regulates our educational data.

1151
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,850
All of these data sources
are held at the agency level

1152
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,190
because they're the
ones who best understand

1153
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,200
the constraints and the
requirements of their data.

1154
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,260
So, Russell certainly
representing the data at DBHDS

1155
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,850
and there are people like Russell

1156
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,010
at each of the different
agencies that hold data.

1157
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,540
I mean, that's a challenge,

1158
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,050
but it's also an opportunity
of how do we create mechanisms

1159
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,610
to share things safely and securely.

1160
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,890
So, I don't want to give the impression

1161
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,090
that hey, we take it all

1162
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,860
and just kind of throw
it into a great big room

1163
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,500
and that everybody just kind
of has that citizen data.

1164
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,300
That is not the case at all,

1165
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,120
that this stuff is very,
very tightly locked down,

1166
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,400
sometimes too excessively so,

1167
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,110
but we take that very seriously.

1168
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,100
Cybersecurity data protection
is a key missionary

1169
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,670
of the state because we do
hold the role that we have

1170
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,760
of being custodians of citizen
data extremely seriously.

1171
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,443
So, that's part of what we do.

1172
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,504
- [Bryant] Thank you. Other questions?

1173
00:48:49,504 --> 00:48:52,890
- [Audience Member] Yeah,
I was curious if you have

1174
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,220
or are using any level of
SDOH to determine propensity

1175
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,693
for service needs?

1176
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,830
- So, we have talked about integration

1177
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,780
from some additional sources.

1178
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,010
We do have some external lines,

1179
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,740
but we have not delved very
far into social determinants

1180
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,180
of health data sets.

1181
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,010
We've been examining what
some of the best ones are

1182
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,240
in relation to the information

1183
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,283
that they have now as a wealth of them,

1184
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,280
especially some of the
propensity around supporting

1185
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,410
more of the demographic
information that's not available

1186
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,620
through, you know, the service delivery

1187
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,540
aspect of the messages.

1188
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,490
But I think that's something
they're starting to bridge now

1189
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:29,520
with the department of what
are those externalized sets?

1190
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,720
Where do we pull them down from?

1191
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,890
How do we curate what they are?

1192
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,910
How do we link them together

1193
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,230
with the existing data that they have?

1194
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,150
So, it's part of the journey is just,

1195
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,303
I think it's something
that we're starting off on.

1196
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,033
- [Staff] Next one's right here.

1197
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:44,430
- [Audience Member] I just
had a quick question about

1198
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,980
how you've used the system
with the implementation

1199
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,790
of Marcus Alerts in Virginia
and how the coordination

1200
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,750
between the behavioral
health data ingestion

1201
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,480
and the PSAP CAD center 911 stuff

1202
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,130
has worked with you guys' system.

1203
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,180
- What was the second part? I'm sorry.

1204
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,550
With behavioral health
with relation to what?

1205
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,723
- [Audience Member] 911 centers.

1206
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:12,683
- Oh, 911 centers. Oh, okay, gotcha.

1207
00:50:12,683 --> 00:50:14,040
Okay.

1208
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,050
- Okay, so you're talking about PSAPs.

1209
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,860
Those are the call centers
operate, take 911 call.

1210
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,590
And those are operated
at the locality level.

1211
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,420
Now, there is an organization,

1212
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,160
the Virginia Department
of Emergency Management

1213
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,420
that has governance across,

1214
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,697
what we call Next Generation 911.

1215
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,440
And that allows interoperability

1216
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,590
between the various 911 call centers.

1217
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,940
So, if one center goes down,

1218
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,920
other center is able to step up,

1219
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,470
but each one operates
in a particular region.

1220
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,610
They do take the call.

1221
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,180
They're able to dispatch
first responders to that area

1222
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,010
and provide the citizen
with the help that they need

1223
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,480
in order to secure the
safety of all involved.

1224
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,920
But the data is really
held at the locality level.

1225
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,397
So there is not a necessarily
a mechanism to merge that data

1226
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:04,830
beyond the record.

1227
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:08,460
Now, once there is an
interaction with the citizen,

1228
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,380
the patient, they do generate a record.

1229
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,330
That record does then flow in through

1230
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,060
what we call the office of EMS.

1231
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,160
They then take that
record to have awareness

1232
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,600
of what's happening on a
statewide basis, you know.

1233
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,440
So, we know within 24
hours every single call

1234
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,430
that happened in the state.

1235
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,633
So, it's pretty cool.

1236
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,500
- I think right now what
we're looking in particular at

1237
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,900
is that the health event
itself could identify somebody

1238
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,520
who may have come in because
they've been unconscious.

1239
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,390
But I think the tie is

1240
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,980
what we're trying to get to now around.

1241
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,870
There was a call that was
made particularly about that,

1242
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,060
which had a responder
that came then to it,

1243
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,400
which is the reason why that
person ended up in a facility

1244
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,080
or otherwise with the
situation that they're in.

1245
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,380
So, there are some definitive
data matching rules

1246
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,213
that we use in particular

1247
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:52,440
to try to completely match those up.

1248
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,730
I think that's an algorithm

1249
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:56,280
that we continue to look
at and its efficacy.

1250
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,560
It's one of the things that
Russell had also mentioned

1251
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,720
of putting out something in
front of those data stewards

1252
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,150
to say these match
levels, whether we believe

1253
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,590
that they're corresponding accurately

1254
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,060
with the things that
we're matching them on,

1255
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,410
and is that the right level

1256
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,450
of matching that we're trying to get to.

1257
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,310
But it is still, I
think, an ongoing process

1258
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:15,150
around how accurate is that
with where the data sets

1259
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,650
that we're trying to match up.

1260
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,753
- [Bryant] Any other
questions from the group?

1261
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,565
All right, stunned silence.

1262
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:35,010
- Yay.
- Okay.

1263
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,890
We'll stick around for a few minutes after

1264
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,300
in case there's some other followups

1265
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,130
that you'd all would
like to have in person.

1266
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,677
And thank you everyone for showing up and-

1267
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,418
(audience applauding)
- Yeah. Thank you.

1268
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:46,968
- Thank you to the panel today.
