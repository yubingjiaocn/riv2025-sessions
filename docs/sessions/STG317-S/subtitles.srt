1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,450
- Hey, everyone, welcome
to re:Invent 2025.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,710
Thank you for choosing to spend

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,600
the next one hour or so with us.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,760
We're gonna make it worthwhile.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,080
In this session, we'll discuss

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,930
how you can make your
application data resilient

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,180
using Clumio, and these applications

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,730
can be Gen AI or otherwise.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,560
We'll go through a host of scenarios

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,320
ranging all the way from NoSQL databases

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,410
to Rack data pipelines
to data lake houses.

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,670
Quick round of introductions.

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,990
My name is Akshay Joshi.

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,790
I'm a senior director
of product management

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,400
here at Clumio, and Clumio is now part

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,150
of the Commvault cloud portfolio,
and I'm joined by Jeff.

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,410
- Good morning, everyone.

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,700
My name is Jeff Cassiana.

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,490
I am a principal engineer in
our cloud sales organization

20
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,670
focusing on Clumio and AWS.

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,230
I'm also a former Amazonian.

22
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,690
I was a storage specialist
solutions architect.

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,030
It's great to be speaking with you today.

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,200
- Cool.

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,430
All right, so let's get started.

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,760
Before we begin, let's take a look at why

27
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,800
we need to care about
resilience right now.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,670
AI is everywhere, and
52% of the data leaders

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,910
that were surveyed by AWS said
that their data foundations

30
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,160
are not ready for AI implementation,

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,890
and that's horrible.

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,260
And that's why we're here
to talk about resilience

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,460
at the data layer.

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,413
It's absolutely foundational.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,443
Oh.

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
- We wanna acknowledge something
right off the bat, though.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
Resiliency can mean a
lot of different things,

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
but I think we can all agree

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,943
it's essential to your
cloud infrastructure.

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,330
Akshay and I speak to
customers all the time.

41
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,430
We speak to companies, and
we get many definitions

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,220
of what resiliency is,
but one thing's consistent

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,680
is that there are common occurrences

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,320
that affect resiliency in the cloud

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,870
in a pretty negative way,
and we've put a few of those

46
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,880
as examples on the screen.

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,840
The first being an accidental deletion.

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,430
This can be somebody just
accidentally making a mistake

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,700
and deleting a directory in
your cloud infrastructure

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,770
that has some critical data on it.

51
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,570
It could be a cleanup script

52
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,240
that perhaps wasn't just fully dialed in.

53
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,120
It's basically a mistake,
and mistakes occur.

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,220
Humans are mistake-prone.

55
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,870
They're not perfect, that can happen.

56
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,310
That's definitely one reason
why resiliency is essential.

57
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,980
Another is something that
we probably have all heard

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,850
in the news lately where
code pushes maybe go wrong,

59
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,450
and it becomes a front page
of the internet type event.

60
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,070
Software is not perfect.

61
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,630
It can create havoc.

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,680
It can create a scenario
where resiliency does suffer,

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
and lastly, it's almost
a hour-by-hour thing.

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,330
It's definitely a day-by-day thing

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,260
where bad actors act with negative intent

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,300
on your cloud infrastructure.

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,710
Prime example is ransomware,

68
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,990
but that's not the only example,

69
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,290
so we wanna establish what
we believe resiliency to be

70
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,640
and why it is absolutely essential

71
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,000
in your cloud infrastructure.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,790
Let's get some participation
from the audience

73
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,080
if you don't mind.

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,780
We have a couple questions
that we would like to see

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,853
you raise your hands in response to.

76
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,420
The first is how many of you
are using the AWS Cloud today

77
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,320
to build your applications?

78
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,250
I already got one hand.

79
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,000
To build your applications
in a generative AI way

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,910
with a generative AI or a
large language model pipeline,

81
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,560
I see a bunch of raised hands.

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,393
That's great.

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,870
Like I mentioned, Akshay and
I speak to a lot of companies

84
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,660
very frequently, and this is
extremely common these days

85
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,830
in the AWS Cloud.

86
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,120
AWS is very effective at
making that a reality.

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,890
One second question that I would love

88
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,350
to get a raise of hands about as well,

89
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,050
similar and related to
the previous question,

90
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,220
how many of you are actually
protecting the data layer

91
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,530
that powers these gen
AI cloud applications?

92
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,050
Is that something you
take seriously today,

93
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,153
or is it an overlooked factor?

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,490
Less hands.

95
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,440
That's actually very common.

96
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,370
It's very related to what Akshay
and I hear from companies.

97
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,010
They're really building
some incredible stuff

98
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,000
in the AWS Cloud that
powers their chat bots,

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,960
but it's interesting how often

100
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,993
data protection is overlooked.

101
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,020
We're gonna paint a real-world
picture for you today.

102
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,820
We created a fictitious app.

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,470
I wanna emphasize this is not real.

104
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,860
We didn't get permission to
use any actual real apps.

105
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,870
There's actually a
little bit of humor here,

106
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,100
lightheartedness.

107
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,190
It was vibe coded by our
CTO in about a weekend.

108
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,030
It's really kind of cool.

109
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,990
I'm very impressed by it.

110
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,720
It's called Clumio Final Cut.

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,120
Think of it as an app, a smartphone app

112
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,330
that similar to probably
what you use today.

113
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,300
It's using an openly available data set

114
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,450
of thousands of movies,
actual real movies,

115
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,770
that typically is used

116
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,053
for machine learning type experimentation.

117
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,440
And here's the picture we wanna paint.

118
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,260
We'll call this user Sharon here.

119
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,280
Let's go ahead and press play.

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,933
We have a video going here.

121
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,480
This is our user Sharon.

122
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,340
She's using the Clumio Flick app.

123
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,670
She's loving it, but all of
a sudden, something happens.

124
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,710
Resiliency is suffering.

125
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,560
She tries to go use the AI
chatbot as a part of the app

126
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,860
to provide her with recommendations

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,720
of what she wants to watch
next, and it starts to fail.

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,110
There's her using the
movie assistant chatbot

129
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,003
as a part of the app that we built.

130
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,290
And you can see errors
are starting to pop up.

131
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,670
It failed to load.

132
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,050
She has a watch list.

133
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,090
It's not finding her entries.

134
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,380
She's frustrated.

135
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,180
She went from happy to unhappy.

136
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,390
Like a typical smartphone user

137
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,380
who have come to expect extremely
good performance from AWS

138
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,050
because AWS has set the
bar very high with that,

139
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,000
she goes to her favorite social media app

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,620
and starts complaining.

141
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,690
Perhaps her friends see her complaints,

142
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,660
the people she follows, they
start noticing the failures.

143
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,830
This is a bad day.

144
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,833
This is a failure of
the cloud application.

145
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,480
Let's dissect what's going on here.

146
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,410
And in order to do that,

147
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,940
I'm gonna pass it back over to Akshay

148
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,190
to explain the first
part of the cloud app.

149
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,450
- Thank you, Jeff.

150
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,140
All right, we all saw Sharon
struggle with the application.

151
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,490
Now let's see how we can
dissect the application

152
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,823
and see what's happening under the hood.

153
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,420
So let's go feature by feature.

154
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,520
The first feature that
Sharon struggled with

155
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,670
was the user profile data
and the watch list data.

156
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,750
And the application uses
DynamoDB under the hood

157
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,240
to store user profile data
and the watch list data.

158
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,490
And DynamoDB is actually a perfect choice

159
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,260
to store that kind of data

160
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,290
because it's inherently partitioned

161
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,420
and it's multi-tenant in nature.

162
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,480
And finally, it's also highly scalable.

163
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,610
Now, a couple of our customers
actually use DynamoDB

164
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,373
for the very same reasons,
to store user data.

165
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,030
While scalable, it's also
absolutely vulnerable.

166
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,090
So imagine a standard canary deployment

167
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,530
where you're updating your
application in tranches.

168
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,080
Users get the updates in tranches.

169
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,880
And if a code push goes wrong,

170
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,250
this may be due to a bug, for example,

171
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,740
the users won't be able
to access the data at all

172
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,920
because those partitions
would get corrupted.

173
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,860
And that's what happened
to Sharon in our example.

174
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,850
She couldn't use her user
profile or watch list screens

175
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,363
because the underlying
DynamoDB table got impacted.

176
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,030
Now, let's visualize
the problem a bit more.

177
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,370
Let's see how the event unfolded.

178
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,020
As I mentioned, the canary
deployment starts at 1 p.m. here

179
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,980
and then partitions are
being updated in tranches.

180
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,860
And at 2.30 p.m., somebody reports a bug

181
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,423
that your DynamoDB partitions
have been corrupted.

182
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,270
Thankfully though, in this example,

183
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,150
only a couple of partitions were impacted

184
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,120
but then there could be a scenario

185
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,730
where thousands of DynamoDB
partitions may get impacted

186
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,140
because it's highly scalable

187
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,130
and consumer apps usually
have millions of users.

188
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,130
So the complication here is
that every single partition

189
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,530
gets impacted at a different timestamp.

190
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,820
So the last known good
copy of a DynamoDB table

191
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,560
is actually not a single timestamp.

192
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,490
It depends on the
partition that's impacted.

193
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,560
And that's the complication
that we're gonna explore

194
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,683
and learn about how to
recover from in this session.

195
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,130
All right, so in case of such an event,

196
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,980
let's wear the hat of an SRE.

197
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,420
SRE has four recovery imperatives

198
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,370
to deal with at that point.

199
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,900
First, they'll have to recover

200
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,670
to a known good point in time.

201
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,040
And the challenge, as we all know,

202
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,870
is that every single partition

203
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,160
can have a different last good known copy.

204
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,000
And then number two,
you need to also ensure

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,540
that the reconfiguration
at the application level

206
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,250
is as little as possible.

207
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,420
Because you don't have to deal

208
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,020
with reconfiguring the application

209
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,830
to talk to a different DynamoDB instance.

210
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,983
And that can be a
time-consuming operation.

211
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,400
Number three, of course, TCL.

212
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,500
You need to ensure that the resources

213
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,220
that you end up spending to
get the app back up online

214
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,920
is as minimal as possible.

215
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,070
And finally, you need to ensure
the best user experience,

216
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,620
which means little to no downtime.

217
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,680
And we don't want Sharon to get frustrated

218
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,723
and go on social media at that point.

219
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,560
So let's take a look
at how you can recover

220
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,910
from such an event.

221
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,620
I'm gonna talk about two different ways

222
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,960
of recovering from any event.

223
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,350
One, the hard way, and
two, the simple way,

224
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,540
which is the Clumio way.

225
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,960
So in the absence of Clumio,
it's an arduous process.

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,650
For each partition's last
known good point in time,

227
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,590
you have to do a full restore.

228
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,740
And mind you, this is for
each and every partition

229
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,620
that's impacted, you'll
have to do a full restore.

230
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,200
And then you need to
cherry-pick the pieces

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,960
for each partition from the full restores,

232
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,580
copy it back to the source table

233
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,880
so that you don't have to
reconfigure the application

234
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,070
at a later point in time.

235
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,860
And finally, delete all
the temporary tables

236
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,480
that you've created.

237
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,280
And finally, I want to mention
that you have to do this

238
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,470
over and over again for
every single partition

239
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,240
that's impacted.

240
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,130
If you have 1,000 partitions impacted,

241
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,840
you'll have to do this 1,000 times.

242
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,580
Now imagine that.

243
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,963
That's recovery hell.

244
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,420
And now, let's take a
look at how simple it is

245
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,140
to recover using Clumio
Backtrack for DynamoDB.

246
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,800
It's literally a two-step process.

247
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,130
Step number one, you pick a point in time,

248
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,260
choose a partition that you wanna recover,

249
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,750
hit recover, and that's about it.

250
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,010
It recovers only what's needed
for every single partition

251
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,560
to the point in time that you've selected

252
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,180
and directly to the source table

253
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,900
so you don't have to reconfigure
the application at all.

254
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,470
And step number two, there is no step two.

255
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,320
Simple as that, all right?

256
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,840
So let's learn a bit more

257
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,170
about Clumio Backtrack for DynamoDB.

258
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,330
We launched Clumio Backtrack for DynamoDB

259
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,280
back in June of this year.

260
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,860
It's essentially a recovery modality

261
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,690
with three distinct features.

262
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,650
One, you can recover to any point in time

263
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,350
that's available in your backup.

264
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,510
Two, it's in-place restore.

265
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,380
It means that it goes back
to the source table directly

266
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,080
so that you don't have to
create temporary tables,

267
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,380
repoint the application to
talk to a different restored

268
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,710
DynamoDB table or none of that.

269
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,560
And then three, granular recovery.

270
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,300
You can perform a recovery
at any granularity

271
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,320
and this can be, in the case of DynamoDB,

272
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,570
it can be at the record
level, partition level,

273
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,580
or at the table level itself.

274
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,570
Now let's see the feature
and the event in action.

275
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,390
I'm gonna hand it back to Jeff

276
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,163
to show you a quick demo on that.

277
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,133
- Thank you, Akshay.

278
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,920
We prerecorded a demo of our vibecoded app

279
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,070
called Clumio Flick and what
I'm gonna demonstrate today

280
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,280
is what Akshay just explained
about what Clumio Backtrack

281
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,590
for DynamoDB is capable of doing.

282
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,210
What you see on the screen right here

283
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,940
is what we call the movie watch list.

284
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,760
But this particular part
of the app is a watch list

285
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,260
that allows you to search

286
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,200
for a particular customer's watch list

287
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,530
and it is all entirely based on DynamoDB.

288
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,000
You can see I've highlighted the section

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,320
that all of these records are
coming from DynamoDB items.

290
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,633
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
search for Customer ID 3.

291
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,370
That takes me to Customer
ID 3's specific watch page,

292
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,440
so very similar to what
you might experience

293
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,930
in your favorite movie smartphone app.

294
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,730
In that customer watch list,

295
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,530
I have two things that I can do.

296
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,610
I can use the AI Movie
Assistant as a chatbot

297
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,450
to interact with our large
language model pipeline

298
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,300
and ask questions using
natural language prompts.

299
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,597
In this case, I'm gonna ask,

300
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,170
"Tell me more about the
movie Clumio to the Moon."

301
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,660
I mentioned we're using real movies

302
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,560
in this openly available dataset,

303
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,200
but we did insert one just
for a little bit of humor

304
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,250
that is related to a fictitious
movie that Clumio created.

305
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,210
And then in the watch list,

306
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,590
it's actually mentioned in there.

307
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,540
And then I'm gonna show
you in the AWS console

308
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,627
where all of this is coming from.

309
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,480
We have a DynamoDB table

310
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,790
that has all of the user
watch lists in there.

311
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,450
I'm gonna filter the table by
just the Customer ID 3 items,

312
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,580
and you can see the corresponding items

313
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,780
in that DynamoDB table.

314
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,110
This is the critical data to
ensure a good user experience

315
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,780
is resilient for Customer ID 3.

316
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,570
You can see in the Movie
AI Assistant chatbot,

317
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,210
it has responded with
some really interesting,

318
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,190
rich information about Clumio to the Moon.

319
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,900
Things like the plot of the movie,

320
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,920
some interesting metadata about revenue,

321
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,000
even some catchphrases
when the movie was created,

322
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,390
and the genre as well.

323
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,410
This is a happy state.

324
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,040
This is Sharon loving the
app, having a great time,

325
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,510
a user that will come back,

326
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,820
a user that will be loyal to you.

327
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,490
Let's simulate an unhappy situation.

328
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,370
Let's simulate a bad day,
a bad user experience.

329
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,940
We're gonna do that with a
Python script that we created

330
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,460
that will purposely,
let's simulate corruption

331
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,000
in Customer ID's DynamoDB items.

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,950
Essentially, we're removing them,

333
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,740
simulating perhaps an
accidental deletion scenario

334
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,303
like I mentioned a second ago.

335
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,500
I refreshed the User ID's,
Customer ID 3's watch list page.

336
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,910
Everything's gone.

337
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,700
This is absolutely a
demonstration of what we showed

338
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,800
that Sharon experienced a second ago.

339
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,450
There's nothing there.

340
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,460
Unhappy customer, unhappy user.

341
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,710
I'm gonna refresh the DynamoDB table.

342
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,630
That simulated corruption

343
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,140
has completely removed
Customer ID's entries

344
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,670
and there's no matches found now

345
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,280
when I filter for that
particular customer.

346
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,360
The good news is we are
taking a backup of this table

347
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,203
and we have been for some time.

348
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:29,460
What you're seeing on the screen

349
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,050
is the Clumio SaaS interface.

350
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,600
Our calendar view,
everywhere you see a dot

351
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,250
in that calendar view is a point in time

352
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,573
we can recover back to.

353
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,240
Usually, like Akshay was mentioning,

354
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,380
this is a very difficult
process to restore.

355
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,520
Resiliency and faith in
your customer with Clumio.

356
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,130
All I need to do, and I
have different options here,

357
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,990
is choose a recovery modality.

358
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,370
The first one I'm gonna show you

359
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,520
is our cyber resilient recovery modality.

360
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,950
So unlike the simulation we're creating

361
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,020
where there's been accidental deletion,

362
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,080
that's ideal for if there is
a compromise of some kind,

363
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,270
a cyber related threat.

364
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,380
You're recovering the DynamoDB table

365
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,640
or individual Customer ID's item

366
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,400
from an air-gapped immutable secure copy

367
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,720
that will be unaffected in the event

368
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,523
of a cyber related incident.

369
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
I have multiple different points in time

370
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,620
in just that particular
day in the calendar.

371
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,200
So I have a lot of choices here.

372
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
But what I wanna demonstrate

373
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,270
is going back to a point in time in place.

374
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,530
Something that we announced,

375
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,470
like Akshay mentioned a couple months ago,

376
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,990
with Clumio Backtrack for DynamoDB.

377
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,330
What you can see on the screen
is I picked a point in time.

378
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,680
I know the text is a little small,

379
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,680
but I did pick a point in time
where I know that there is

380
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,860
a good DynamoDB recovery
point to go back to,

381
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,567
and I'm given three options.

382
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,180
The one I'm highlighting
is the in place option.

383
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,370
That is the Clumio Backtrack for DynamoDB.

384
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,860
That is avoiding all of
the app reconfiguration

385
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,720
that Akshay mentioned just a second ago,

386
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,920
and recovering Customer
ID's specific item entries

387
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,140
alone in place.

388
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,340
All I need to do is search for
the Customer ID string three,

389
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
which I'll do at the bottom here.

390
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,880
When I press Preview, it'll
query that point in time

391
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,980
to make sure that what I wanna recover

392
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,080
is actually correct in there.

393
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,830
I've successfully found
the recovery items.

394
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,120
I'm given a summary of
what I'm about to do,

395
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,860
just to confirm that I'm
doing the right thing.

396
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,400
I'm gonna initiate the restore

397
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,340
that has created a
brand new task in Clumio

398
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,560
that I can monitor for completeness.

399
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,340
The very beginning of the task,

400
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,460
it is queued, and through
the magic of video editing,

401
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,780
we're just going to skip ahead

402
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,780
to when the actual task has completed.

403
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,420
And in order to prove that
it has been completed,

404
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,940
and this is a very similar
scenario to what you might do,

405
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm just gonna refresh the DynamoDB table.

406
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,750
All of the entries have recovered,

407
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,090
and they're back to where they should be.

408
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,220
And just like what a user would experience

409
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,760
like our user Sharon, close
the app in my smartphone,

410
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,080
reopen it, it refreshes the
page, all of my movies are back.

411
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,020
We have successfully restored
resiliency in our application

412
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,243
because of a DynamoDB issue.

413
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,840
We're gonna give you another scenario.

414
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,810
This has to do with S3 specifically.

415
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,570
For that, I'll pass it
back over to Akshay.

416
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,650
- All right, thank you, Jeff.

417
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,360
That was a great demo.

418
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
The second feature that
we're gonna talk about today

419
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,620
is the concierge chat bot.

420
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,110
You would have seen Sharon
interacting with the chat bot

421
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,830
where she's asking
recommendations about movies,

422
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,760
and then more details about
the movies that she watched.

423
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
So that's the chat bot using,

424
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,340
I mean, that's built using
a large language model.

425
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,100
And again, this is a typical LLM feature

426
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,120
with a rack data pipeline
that we're all familiar with.

427
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,710
It has three components.

428
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,940
One is it has a bunch of
objects with movie details.

429
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,780
These could be like text
files, PDFs, or JSON files,

430
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,400
all of that storing
movie-related information.

431
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,940
And it's stored in an S3 bucket.

432
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,680
And then there is a vector store

433
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,590
where we've computed all
the vector embeddings

434
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,720
from the S3 bucket data,

435
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,650
and we've stored it in S3
vectors for this example.

436
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,580
And then finally, the LLM layer

437
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,080
connects to the vectorized database.

438
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,490
And that is what enables the
LLM to answer the questions

439
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,710
that you ask about any movie

440
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,580
that's available on the app.

441
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Now, again, if the S3 data itself is lost,

442
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,983
then it's gonna be,

443
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,820
basically, the vectors
would be pointing nowhere.

444
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,760
So in that case, the Final Cut chat bot

445
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,620
won't be able to talk to the vector store

446
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,640
because the vectors themselves
are pointing nowhere.

447
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,390
And then finally, Sharon won't
be able to get the answers

448
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,990
that she needs from the
large language model.

449
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,690
So now, let's see how the event unfolded

450
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,260
here, you can see that
as the objects are lost,

451
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,460
the LLM starts going rogue.

452
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,240
You can see that the LLM is not being,

453
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,750
not answering the
questions satisfactorily.

454
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,500
We all know that "Love Actually"
is not an action movie.

455
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,560
So the LLM has basically gone rogue,

456
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,160
and the vector store
is essentially useless

457
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,160
if the bucket data that it's
pointing to is not available.

458
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,590
Now, let's take a look at
the recovery imperatives

459
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,670
once again.

460
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,830
I mean, coming back to the SRE persona

461
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,840
that we keep talking about.

462
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,940
So there are a few changes,

463
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,980
it's again the four recovery imperatives

464
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,800
that the SREs deal with in this scenario,

465
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,483
but then there are a few changes.

466
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,230
First one is that there should be

467
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,420
as little data loss as possible

468
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,420
because the vector data is
pointing to the S3 bucket data,

469
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,070
even if there's a small
amount of data loss

470
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,780
at the S3 bucket level,

471
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,150
then the vectors would
essentially be useless.

472
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,620
So we don't want that situation.

473
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,410
So the first imperative is that

474
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,800
the last known good recovery point

475
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,913
should have all the data and
should have zero data loss.

476
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,200
Number two, there should be
as little reconfiguration

477
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,890
required at the LLM layer as possible.

478
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,540
Again, it's a complex
process to rewire the LLM

479
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,500
to the new vector data store.

480
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,700
So that's why you need to
avoid this as much as possible.

481
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,180
And number three, you need
to keep your costs in check.

482
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,840
Recomputing the vectors
on all of your data

483
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,840
is a time compute and
cost intensive operation.

484
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,210
You wouldn't want to
undertake that kind of effort.

485
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,530
And then finally, user
experience matters once again.

486
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,160
There should be little to no downtime

487
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,550
for users like Sharon.

488
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,910
She shouldn't get frustrated
asking simple questions as,

489
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,170
hey, is "Love Actually" a
comedy movie or an action movie?

490
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,520
So now again, I'm gonna show you

491
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,830
what recovery hell looks like.

492
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,140
And then we'll talk about Clumio.

493
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,280
In the absence of Clumio, again,

494
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,000
what you have to do is you
have to do a full restore

495
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,140
of the S3 bucket back to
a last known good copy.

496
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,840
And then you need to recompute the vectors

497
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,620
on the restored bucket.

498
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,430
And you need to remove
the old vector store.

499
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,220
You need to clean up all of that data.

500
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,870
And then you need to clean
up the old bucket as well.

501
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,860
And then finally, you
need to point your LLM

502
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,620
to the new vector store

503
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,520
because your vector store
itself has changed now.

504
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,870
Your S3 bucket was restored

505
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,480
to a completely different
bucket than it was.

506
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,120
So the vector embeddings had
to be recomputed at that point.

507
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,360
And the S3 vector store

508
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
would also be a different
bucket altogether.

509
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,313
Now the LLM has to be pointed to that.

510
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,570
Now again, let's go back to Clumio

511
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,250
and take a look at Clumio's
two-step recovery process.

512
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,970
So this is possible due to
Clumio backtrack for S3.

513
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,730
We'll talk about Clumio
backtrack for S3 in just a bit.

514
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,510
But again, step number one,
you select a point in time,

515
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,700
choose only the impacted objects.

516
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,520
Mind you, you don't need to
restore the entire bucket here.

517
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,800
It's not all or nothing with us.

518
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,230
You restore only the impacted pieces.

519
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,413
You choose the impacted
objects and then click restore.

520
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,373
And step number two, there is no step two.

521
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,990
No need to recompute
the vectors, no cleanup,

522
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,203
no changes at the LLM
layer, simple as that.

523
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,940
All right, so we launched Clumio backtrack

524
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,990
for Amazon S3 last year
at re:Invent, in fact.

525
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,630
And backtrack for S3 is basically

526
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,510
the three same features packaged together.

527
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,750
It's in-place recovery
so that you can recover

528
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,430
back to the source bucket itself

529
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,010
without having to reconfigure
the application layer,

530
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,760
vector store, or LLM, none of that.

531
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,080
And granular recovery,
again, in case of S3,

532
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,610
granularity can mean different things.

533
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,940
So in S3, granularity can
be at the object level,

534
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,720
prefix level, or at the
bucket level itself.

535
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,640
And finally, point in time recovery.

536
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,710
You can go back to any point in time

537
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,710
that's available in our
backup using Clumio backtrack.

538
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,720
And note that Clumio backtrack for S3

539
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,640
works with or without SecureVault.

540
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,830
SecureVault is our backup offering.

541
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,210
Again, you may be using versioning for S3,

542
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,940
and that may be your
idea of data protection,

543
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,590
and we don't judge you for that.

544
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,910
That's totally fine.

545
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,560
You can still roll back your versions

546
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,180
to any given point in time using backtrack

547
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,243
without the need to back it up with us.

548
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,490
And finally, we have
continuous change tracking

549
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,730
for S3 objects, which means
that every single change

550
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,370
that happens at the object
level or at the version level

551
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,120
is continuously tracked,
and we back it up.

552
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,540
So that there is absolutely
no data loss whatsoever.

553
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,910
If you remember, this ties back

554
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,520
to the very first recovery imperative

555
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,843
that the SREs deal with.

556
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,780
All right, so now let's
see this in action.

557
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,630
I'm gonna hand it off to
Jeff for a quick demo.

558
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,463
There you go.

559
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
- Great stuff, Akshay.

560
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,950
So I wanna acknowledge, again,
resiliency is important,

561
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,230
but also what we've experienced

562
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,260
and what Akshay just explained is accuracy

563
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,900
in your chatbot is also
extremely important.

564
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,330
It's very common and
actually really, really easy

565
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,440
for LLMs to spit out
gibberish, to hallucinate,

566
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,810
to give inaccurate information.

567
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,990
That doesn't necessarily,
that can happen very easily

568
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,660
by just having some sort
of incident or event

569
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,540
that has data loss associated with it.

570
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,890
So let's go back to our
ClumioFlix vibe-coded app

571
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,600
in the AWS cloud.

572
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,850
We're now back at customer ID three,

573
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,473
just like we were before.

574
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,080
And I'm gonna give it another prompt.

575
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,510
I'm gonna ask it to tell me
more about Clumio to the,

576
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,670
I'm sorry, yeah, I'm gonna
ask it to tell me more

577
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,880
about Clumio to the moon,
just like we did before

578
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,810
in the DynamoDB example.

579
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,700
While we wait for that
to think, I'll go ahead

580
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,580
and highlight that we have
an entire part of the app,

581
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,800
just like what Sharon was experiencing,

582
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,620
that is dedicated to
just a specific movie.

583
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,880
And in this case, we're highlighting

584
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,240
our lighthearted Clumio to the moon movie.

585
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,650
You can see there's a lot of rich, cool,

586
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,930
interesting information
about that particular movie.

587
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,450
I can totally imagine a business

588
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,120
wanting to do research
on a particular movie.

589
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,860
This could be really helpful for them.

590
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,890
Information like the plot,
the revenue that it generated,

591
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,570
movies that are similar to it.

592
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,150
This could be very helpful for researching

593
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,400
the next project, for example.

594
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,410
You may have noticed
that in the address bar,

595
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,500
and this would be the same
thing with a smartphone app,

596
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,050
that that movie was
represented by a number.

597
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,630
This entire openly
available movie database

598
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,190
is filled with S3 object
files in JSON format

599
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,990
that are represented by a number.

600
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,220
You can see that on the screen.

601
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm highlighting the actual S3 bucket

602
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,770
that we're using for this
app called Clumio Demo Movie.

603
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,983
Each one of the objects is
a number followed by .json.

604
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,890
Just to show you this specific object

605
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,360
for Clumio to the moon, I'll
do a search for 7000.json.

606
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,770
That's what's connected and associated

607
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,060
with Clumio to the moon,

608
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,640
and highlight that we do
have S3 versioning enabled.

609
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,100
Like Akshay said, it's a great choice.

610
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,250
Doesn't necessarily
provide 100% resiliency,

611
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,970
but it's very fantastic that
AWS offers something like that.

612
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,010
What Clumio has done
is enhanced the ability

613
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,873
to leverage it at scale.

614
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,580
I also point out that
we're also using S3 tables

615
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,693
for providing this information,
and then S3 vectors as well.

616
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,340
And again, like the
DynamoDB, the good news is

617
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,437
we're backing this S3 bucket with Clumio,

618
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:03,420
and we have multiple
different recovery points

619
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,300
that we can go back to in the last month.

620
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,490
Just like with the DynamoDB recording

621
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,600
we showed you a second ago,

622
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,730
lots of cool, interesting information

623
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,860
in response to the natural language prompt

624
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,040
that we put into the chat
bot about Clumio to the moon.

625
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,230
Sharon's happy, it's a good day.

626
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,120
Everything's good, no recovery is needed.

627
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,500
Let's turn that around.

628
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900
Let's let resilience
suffer in a simulated way

629
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,300
by executing another Python script

630
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,030
that will harm that S3 object.

631
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,680
It'll essentially remove it.

632
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,480
To prove that that actually occurred,

633
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,790
and we're now in a bad day scenario,

634
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,260
I'll go ahead and submit the exact

635
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,240
same prompt I gave before,

636
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,580
or I'm asking the chat bot
to give me more information

637
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,170
about Clumio to the moon.

638
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,850
While we wait for that to think,

639
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,440
I'll refresh the actual page
which would be representative

640
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,030
of where you would go
in the app to find it.

641
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,770
The movie is gone.

642
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,170
In that, so now we're creating a scenario

643
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,810
like we did in the video with
Sharon where she's frustrated,

644
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,880
she's going to social
media and complaining.

645
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,620
I'll refresh my S3 bucket.

646
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,080
The 7000.json file, completely gone.

647
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,940
There's no matches found.

648
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,180
And that response that I'm now getting

649
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,250
from the exact same
natural language prompt

650
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,430
to the AI movie assistant is different.

651
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,650
It's inaccurate, it's shorter,

652
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,960
it's not as interesting, not as helpful.

653
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,130
It even says at the bottom,

654
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,530
unfortunately, I don't
have all the information.

655
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,290
Like Akshay said, the pipeline's broken.

656
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,030
It's now no longer able to access

657
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,620
that rich, interesting information

658
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,623
from the .json object in that S3 bucket.

659
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,090
Let's do like what we did with DynamoDB.

660
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,160
Let's use Clumio Backtrack for S3

661
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,680
to bring the resiliency back.

662
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,600
But again, just like with DynamoDB,

663
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,730
we also have a modality for S3

664
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,500
to recover from Secure Vault.

665
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,960
Like Akshay mentioned, that's
our immutable air-gapped copy.

666
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,260
So if instead we were simulating
a cyber-related event,

667
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,440
this is what I would recommend
to my customers and companies

668
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,230
is to recover from that
immutable air-gapped

669
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,630
cyber-resilient copy of the object.

670
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,220
In order to do that, I just need to search

671
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,493
for the 7000.json in my example.

672
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:06,780
I don't have to do
that, but in my example,

673
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,370
I just need that object.

674
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,680
It's querying a backup
from the point in time

675
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,790
that I selected.

676
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,620
It found the 7000.json object.

677
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,850
I now have the option to
recover just the latest version

678
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,683
or all versions.

679
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,810
Remember this object in this
bucket has versioning enabled.

680
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,880
There's a lot of benefits
to being able to do that

681
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,830
from a cost and ease point of view.

682
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,570
And like the DynamoDB examples,

683
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,870
I'm given a lot of really
advanced selection options

684
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,720
because I may wanna
customize this restoration.

685
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,430
I can absolutely see a scenario,

686
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,120
especially in a cyber-related event

687
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,680
where I don't wanna recover
to the same AWS account.

688
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,620
If the object in that AWS
account had been compromised,

689
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,350
it's very likely that other
parts of that AWS account

690
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,940
are also compromised.

691
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,260
We give you the ability to recover

692
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,360
to a completely different AWS account,

693
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,280
maybe even one that
you've created brand new

694
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,113
and that is completely clean.

695
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,940
We also give you other options

696
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,440
like recovering to another region.

697
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,100
Maybe there's a
large-scale event occurring

698
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,190
and you need to go to a different region.

699
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,610
And we even give you the ability
to add tags to the object

700
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,850
or store it in a prefix, an S3 prefix.

701
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,920
Very advanced selection options

702
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,650
to make sure that your
particular needs are met

703
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,240
for the specific and
particular recovery scenario

704
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,523
that you have.

705
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,920
But instead, what I wanna demonstrate

706
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,910
is what Akshay mentioned

707
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,190
in what we announced at
AWS re:Invent last year

708
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,403
and that's S3 backtrack for S3.

709
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,950
I'm given the bucket name.

710
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,330
I'm given the point in time.

711
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm choosing the point in time.

712
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,910
I apologize, my mistake.

713
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,490
I'm just gonna go ahead
and choose to pick a hour

714
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,410
that's earlier in the same day.

715
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,900
I'm gonna filter what I
see by the 7000.json object

716
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,320
when I press Preview.

717
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,600
It's going to query the S3 versions

718
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,430
at that particular point in time.

719
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,810
It found the 7000.json for
that specific point in time.

720
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,310
Just like I showed you before,

721
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,530
lots of interesting selectivity options

722
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,000
to customize and be very
specific to your recovery needs.

723
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,700
In my example, I'm just
gonna override the source.

724
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,190
I'm gonna override the
most current object.

725
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,180
I've started a new task
in Clumio to get that done

726
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,560
through the magic of video editing.

727
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,200
We're gonna fast forward
to when it's completed.

728
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,050
And to prove that it's been
completed successfully,

729
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,600
I'll go back to the AI Movie Assistant,

730
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,270
provide the exact same
natural language prompt

731
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,343
to tell me more about Clumio to the Moon.

732
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,420
While it's thinking, we'll go ahead

733
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,170
and go back to the movie
page for Clumio to the Moon.

734
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,780
Just like I would if I was
to close and open the app,

735
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,550
I'm refreshing it. It's there.

736
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,960
The data is there.

737
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,430
I'll refresh the S3 bucket.

738
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,250
The 7000.json has returned.

739
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,620
I'll go back to my AI Movie Assistant,

740
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,210
and I'm back to a happy day.

741
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,043
Sharon's happy.

742
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,960
She's getting the exact
same consistent response

743
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,720
with the rich metadata and
rich interesting information

744
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,880
about Clumio to the Moon movie.

745
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,760
We've successfully restored resiliency

746
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,043
in our cloud application.

747
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,510
We have one more scenario
to cover with you today.

748
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,150
This is specific, and I'm
actually very, very excited

749
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,130
about this one, to Apache Iceberg

750
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,120
and our new support for that.

751
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,980
For that, I'll turn it
back over to Akshay.

752
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,813
- Thank you, Jeff.

753
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:16,380
Another great demo.

754
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,790
The third and the final feature

755
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,200
that we're gonna talk about today

756
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,270
is the Box Office Analyzer.

757
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,010
Again, this is a feature that allows you

758
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,550
to compare movie budgets
and the revenue performance.

759
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,230
This can actually be interesting

760
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,820
for any Hollywood exec out there.

761
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,120
The data layer for this feature

762
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,770
is basically a data lake house

763
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,320
that's powered by Apache Iceberg.

764
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,680
Iceberg has gotten
really popular over time,

765
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,140
and it's the most
preferred open table format

766
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,210
for data lake houses.

767
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,670
And for this specific use case,

768
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,903
we are using S3 tables to
store the Apache Iceberg data.

769
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,950
And not only is this available
as an external feature

770
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,080
for users like Sharon,

771
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,280
but also internal employees of the company

772
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,830
can also use the same data set

773
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,020
to create dashboards internally

774
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,020
to analyze the movie
financial performance.

775
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,110
Iceberg data is actually
vulnerable to writes.

776
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,190
We all know this.

777
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,100
Whenever you run an overwrite query

778
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,190
that changes the schema or
drops a column, for example,

779
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,910
your visualizations don't
really match the schema.

780
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,760
And that mismatch causes
all of your visualizations

781
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,593
to go empty.

782
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:36,420
And in this case, what has happened

783
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,240
is all of the data in the table,

784
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,710
all of the genres for the movies
are overwritten to comedy.

785
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,910
And that's what we're
gonna talk about here.

786
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,590
And because of that,
Final Cut is not able to

787
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,420
pull the information satisfactorily

788
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,420
and give accurate responses
on the visualizations.

789
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,910
And this would also impact any dashboards

790
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,460
that have been created
internally by the employees

791
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,440
outside of the application.

792
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,673
So we'll fix both of those
issues in this scenario.

793
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,720
Okay, let's take a look at the event.

794
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,830
Let's see what unfolded
that led to the situation.

795
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,540
We are using Athena query here

796
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,030
to pull the data from S3 tables.

797
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,800
And we are using QuickSight
as our dashboarding tool

798
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,590
for this example.

799
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,740
And as you notice here,

800
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,280
as the iceberg tables
are getting impacted,

801
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,120
the dashboarding tool is
malfunctioning as well.

802
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,200
So the dashboards are
showing wrong information,

803
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,700
which should not be the case.

804
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,340
And let's talk about
the hard way to recover

805
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,410
from such a scenario.

806
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,880
But before that, let's take a look

807
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,820
at some of the recovery
imperatives once again.

808
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,250
We see a constant theme here

809
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,980
with the SREs dealing with
the same recovery imperatives

810
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,900
over and over again.

811
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,550
But there are a few things

812
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,380
that you need to keep in mind here.

813
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,107
With iceberg data, the
known good recovery points

814
00:36:04,107 --> 00:36:07,380
are actually snapshots or point in time.

815
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,610
It cannot be a single source of truth.

816
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,340
I mean, you can have the data admin

817
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,440
who's well-versed with iceberg snapshots,

818
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,630
and they may know the snapshot ID.

819
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,840
And the S3 admin, for example,

820
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,190
may know the point in time
where the data was clean.

821
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,870
So it could be either or.

822
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,520
So you need to be mindful
of both of those situations

823
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,550
and deal with that.

824
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,670
And number two, there
should be absolutely no need

825
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,170
to recreate dashboards

826
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,770
or reconfigure the application whatsoever.

827
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,730
So all of the recovery
should happen in place.

828
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,620
And finally, of course,
we know that PCO and timer

829
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,500
absolutely essential to keep in mind.

830
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,180
And with that, let's take
a look at recovery hell.

831
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,310
It's a long process.

832
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,900
If you're backing up only the S3 data,

833
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,630
that's powering the iceberg tables.

834
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,830
So in this case, let's
assume that you're backing up

835
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,040
only the general purpose S3
bucket data under the hood

836
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,470
because there is no other iceberg-aware

837
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,160
data protection offering out
there in the market today.

838
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,510
So you have to back up only the S3 data

839
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,880
that's available to you.

840
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,400
And first, you need to do a full restore

841
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,860
of every single S3 bucket

842
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,663
that's holding the iceberg data.

843
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,670
And then you need to restore
the iceberg table structure

844
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,770
once the full restore completes.

845
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,220
This would mean you have to
reconfigure the manifest files,

846
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,250
metadata files, and the
data files to preserve

847
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,910
or bring back the iceberg table structure.

848
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,910
And you need to point the
application to the new tables

849
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,650
once you've restored it.

850
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,590
And then finally,
reconfigure the application

851
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,250
to talk to this new table
that you've restored.

852
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,250
And finally, you need to
reconfigure the application

853
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,090
and recreate all the dashboards
that you would have created

854
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,580
with the previous dataset.

855
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,460
And that's what recovery hell looks like.

856
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Again, let's take a look at
the two-step recovery process

857
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,760
with Clumio.

858
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,150
Again, Clumio is the
only offering out there

859
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,023
that provides iceberg-aware
data protection.

860
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,080
And with that, step number
one is the backup is absolute.

861
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,870
Backup and restores are
iceberg-aware in nature,

862
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,940
which means that you don't
need to restructure the table

863
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,270
once the data has been recovered.

864
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:46,260
So you just pick a snapshot,
you pick a point in time,

865
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,480
and then you click on Recover.

866
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,520
And this recovery happens in place,

867
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,540
so you don't need to deal with
any sort of upstream impact.

868
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,060
And step number two, there is no step two,

869
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,030
as with all of our other
recovery modalities

870
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,350
that we covered.

871
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,930
The application doesn't
need to be reconfigured,

872
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,260
the dashboards don't need to be recreated,

873
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,220
and none of that.

874
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,910
It's simple recovery, just a single step.

875
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,610
Now I can say that it's not
a two-step recovery anymore,

876
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,960
it's just one-step recovery.

877
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,070
All right, so we launched
the industry's first

878
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,490
iceberg-aware data protection
offering back in September.

879
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,770
Let's learn a bit more about that.

880
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,290
The iceberg table structure is preserved

881
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,990
both during backup as well as recovery,

882
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,690
so that you don't have
to restructure the table

883
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,820
once the table has been recovered.

884
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,340
Or you don't have to do
anything under the hood

885
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,080
to preserve the table
structure, even during backup.

886
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,780
And you can back it up and restore it,

887
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,710
and recover it without any hassles,

888
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,130
and in a very transactionally
consistent way.

889
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,380
And the data itself is stored outside

890
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,210
of your enterprise security sphere,

891
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,640
as with all of our other
secure world offerings,

892
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,240
which means that your
data is safe, air-gapped,

893
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,930
and immutable, and it can
actually help you recover

894
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,480
from any sort of threat vectors

895
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,540
that we talked about
earlier in the session.

896
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,100
And then finally, you can retain

897
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,210
as many snapshots as possible
with Clumio Secure Vault,

898
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,020
and this is especially useful
if you need to be compliant

899
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,900
with compliance standards
like FINRA or HIPAA

900
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,300
that require you to store
every single transaction

901
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,880
for about seven to eight years.

902
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,460
And finally, another thing that you can do

903
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,560
with Clumio Secure
Vault for Apache Iceberg

904
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,820
is that you can modernize
your iceberg footprint on AWS.

905
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,510
You can actively migrate your tables

906
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,060
from a general-purpose S3 bucket

907
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,243
to the newly-launched
Amazon S3 Tables feature.

908
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,140
All right, so enough about the feature.

909
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,670
Now let's see it in action.

910
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,333
I'm gonna hand it off to
Jeff for one last demo.

911
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,033
- Thank you, Akshay.

912
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:03,960
Like I mentioned before
Akshay started speaking,

913
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,730
I'm very excited about this.

914
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,860
You heard it correctly from Akshay.

915
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,040
Clumio is the first
Iceberg and S3 Tables-aware

916
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,680
data protection solution in the AWS cloud.

917
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,080
As many of you probably know,

918
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,200
Iceberg is extremely popular
when combined with S3

919
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,990
and various different data pipelines.

920
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,270
It's so popular AWS themselves came out

921
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,890
with a new bucket type, S3 Tables,

922
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,490
at this time last year
at AWS re:Invent 2024.

923
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,410
So we're very happy to be helpful

924
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,170
in being able to participate
in increasing the resiliency

925
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,643
of those different services.

926
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,880
Let me show you another demo.

927
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,870
This is our last demo.

928
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,250
And what you're seeing on the screen

929
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,110
is what we call the movie insights page.

930
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,750
So think of this as, you
know, sharing, using the app

931
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,220
and going to a different part of the app,

932
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,170
again, to probably do some research.

933
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,840
But I can also imagine businesses
using something like this

934
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,020
to do research on maybe what
movie they wanna make next.

935
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,110
They wanna find out that out
of the several thousand movies

936
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,780
that are in our openly available data set,

937
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,220
which ones were the most successful?

938
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,510
Which ones made the most money?

939
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,220
Maybe which ones had the worst returns?

940
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,360
And then we can turn on investment.

941
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,800
Like Akshay said, in the app,

942
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,520
we built this with a pipeline
that included QuickSight

943
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,860
to show this chart
information in a visual way.

944
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,900
I wanna highlight this
chart at the bottom,

945
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,010
revenue by genre.

946
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,710
That's what we're gonna
demonstrate as failing today.

947
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,720
And as you can imagine,
that's some really cool data

948
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,270
that you wanna keep
resilient to keep your users

949
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,800
and maybe even the business users

950
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,693
of your applications happy.

951
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,830
It's broken out by dollar per genre.

952
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,570
And you can see that it's very diverse.

953
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,910
There's a lot of genres listed there.

954
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,840
I'll go ahead and highlight

955
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,330
that we do have an S3 table powering this.

956
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,870
And that S3 table is in
the Apache Iceberg format.

957
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,750
I have it highlighted
here in the AWS console.

958
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,910
And just like with S3 and DynamoDB,

959
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,850
we're also taking
backups of this S3 table.

960
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,280
And we have been for some time now.

961
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,710
We have multiple different
places and points in time

962
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,840
to go back to should we need to.

963
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,850
It's a good day. It's a good thing.

964
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,140
Let's go back to our AI
Movie Assistant chat bot.

965
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,780
But this time I'm gonna give a prompt

966
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,360
to have it tell me the specific genre

967
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,770
for Clumio to the Rune.

968
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,900
I no longer need to know the
information about the movie.

969
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,390
I just wanna know what genre it is.

970
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,400
While it's thinking,

971
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,560
we'll go ahead and explain
how this is querying

972
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,360
that pipeline that Akshay mentioned

973
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,860
and explained a second ago.

974
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,160
It has successfully responded
with the correct genre.

975
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,140
It is action and adventure.

976
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,700
That is the genre of Clumio to the Moon.

977
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,680
Again, another scenario
where sharing is happy

978
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,040
or your business users
are happy of your app.

979
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,110
Let's make it a not so good day.

980
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,120
Let's make it a day where
something bad happens.

981
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,830
Resiliency has suffered.

982
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,450
We need to go back to these imperatives

983
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,820
that Akshay keeps mentioning

984
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,380
to ensure that we increase resiliency

985
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,660
or return back to a
resilient point in time

986
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,833
for this application.

987
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,370
I'm gonna simulate that with
our Python script again,

988
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,700
but this time instead of
actually destroying data,

989
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,080
I'm gonna change the data.

990
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,680
I'm gonna change all the
genres in our S3 table

991
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,900
to be comedy.

992
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,100
When I go back to the movies insight page

993
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,270
and I refresh that, instead
of the data being gone,

994
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,560
the data is incorrect.

995
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,280
I'll go back down to that
chart from QuickSight

996
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,300
that showed the revenue by genre.

997
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,420
Now all 400 billion plus
dollars in revenue is comedy

998
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,810
and all the top movies of revenue

999
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,070
are in the genre of comedy.

1000
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,170
This is obviously not correct.

1001
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,850
This is bad information.

1002
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,370
This is creating a
negative user experience.

1003
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,050
Like let's make it worse.

1004
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,900
Let's do a second suffering
of the application

1005
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,240
by going back and doing what
we did in the previous video

1006
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,300
and completely deleting
the 7000.json object again.

1007
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,530
I'll go ahead and simulate
the negative experience

1008
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,210
that your customers or your businesses

1009
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,140
might have in this app

1010
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,600
by giving the exact same
natural language prompt

1011
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,210
to show me the genre of
"Clumio to the Moon."

1012
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,430
And in this case, after
it's done thinking,

1013
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,620
it'll respond with incorrect information

1014
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,940
and now thinks that "Clumio to
the Moon" is a comedy movie.

1015
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,870
We all know that that's not true.

1016
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,880
We've looked at the data for that movie

1017
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,740
very regularly in these demos.

1018
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,360
So recovery needs to be performed.

1019
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,310
Resiliency has suffered.

1020
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,360
Again, like before,

1021
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,270
I have multiple different
recovery modalities.

1022
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,390
The first one I'm gonna show
you is again that SecureVault,

1023
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,230
immutable air-gapped
cyber-resilient copy of the data.

1024
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,690
But in this case, a nice
little added benefit,

1025
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,580
Akshay touched on it a second ago.

1026
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,390
Not only can we recover from
an immutable air-gapped copy,

1027
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,290
but we can also convert the catalog type

1028
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:33,270
from AWS Glue catalog type
to S3 Tables catalog type.

1029
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,180
A nice little added, almost
migration-related benefit

1030
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,210
to the functionality that Clumio provides

1031
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,610
with the resiliency that
we're showing you today.

1032
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,290
But for my demonstration instead,

1033
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,620
I'm gonna go back to a
very specific point in time

1034
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,610
using the built-in native
Apache Iceberg snapshotting.

1035
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,960
I'm gonna go back to October.

1036
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,550
I'm gonna pick October 30th,

1037
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,110
just 'cause I know
that's the point in time

1038
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,190
I wanna go back to.

1039
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,420
It's successfully found a
snapshot from that point in time.

1040
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,180
Again, just like before,
I can even give the option

1041
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,420
to convert from an AWS Glue catalog type

1042
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,210
to an S3 Table catalog
type during this recovery.

1043
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,710
I've executed the restore.

1044
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,630
A new task has begun.

1045
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,850
But remember, I have multiple things

1046
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,490
I need to recover from in this example,

1047
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,620
not just one like the previous examples.

1048
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,320
I need to go back to
Clumio Backtrack for S3

1049
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,150
and do what I did in the previous video

1050
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,160
where I recover back to a previous version

1051
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,610
of the 7000.json object.

1052
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,160
Just like before, I pick a point in time.

1053
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,490
I do a filter for the 7000.json object.

1054
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,340
It's going to query the
versions for that bucket.

1055
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,720
If there's one that exists,

1056
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,520
it'll come back with a result showing

1057
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,580
that there is a point in time
for that particular object

1058
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,600
that I can go back to.

1059
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,700
It successfully found it.

1060
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,290
Again, I have additional options,

1061
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,240
but in this case, I'm just gonna override

1062
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,770
the existing object.

1063
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,230
Execute the restore task.

1064
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,200
Now I have two restore tasks
running simultaneously.

1065
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,970
Through the magic of video editing again,

1066
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,860
we're gonna fast forward
to when those tasks

1067
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,750
have been completed.

1068
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,450
I'll go back to that Movies Insights page,

1069
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,090
refresh it, which would
be just like a user

1070
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,310
or a business closing
the app in my smartphone

1071
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,960
and reopening it.

1072
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,900
Go back to that same chart
for revenue by genre.

1073
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,430
Everything's back to normal.

1074
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,580
I've successfully restored
the resiliency for my app

1075
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,510
from, in this case, a
multiple failure scenario.

1076
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,330
Again, just like before,
ask the AI Movie Assistant

1077
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,770
the same prompt I asked before.

1078
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,440
I want it to tell me the genre
for "Clumio to the Moon."

1079
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,480
As long as everything
was restored correctly

1080
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,460
and successfully, it should respond

1081
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,230
with the correct and accurate information,

1082
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,020
no longer providing a
negative user experience

1083
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,360
for Sharon or for the
business, and it has.

1084
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,880
It's now showing "Clumio to
the Moon" back to what it was,

1085
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,030
which was an action-adventure genre movie.

1086
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,080
We're in a happy place.

1087
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,280
Sharon's a happy user.

1088
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,833
Your businesses, your
customers are happy users.

1089
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,373
We're in a good spot.

1090
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,980
Let's look at Sharon again,

1091
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,620
our trusty user for our smartphone app.

1092
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,770
She's now looking at it again.

1093
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:07,620
After we've done our restorations,

1094
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,870
her expectations are high,

1095
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,620
which she should have high expectations

1096
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,200
because AWS has set the bar so
high for this type of stuff.

1097
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,610
She does the same search.

1098
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,890
She found a great movie
she wants to watch,

1099
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,560
and she started watching
it, eating her popcorn

1100
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,030
with a smile on her face.

1101
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:28,650
We're back to a resilient
state for our smartphone app,

1102
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,763
our cloud-based app.

1103
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,750
Now that we've gone through
all of these scenarios

1104
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,660
and we've explained to
you how Clumio can help

1105
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,810
increase your resiliency and
why it's important to do so

1106
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:43,080
in the cloud using these
Gen AI pipeline-based,

1107
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,080
cloud-based apps, we
wanna leave you with a,

1108
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,530
and summarize a few pieces of
recommendations that we have.

1109
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:53,100
The first is what we
think are requirements

1110
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,100
for when you design your data strategies,

1111
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,440
data backup and protection strategies,

1112
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,440
and maximize your
potential for resilience.

1113
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,990
Eliminate the risk of
those three examples I gave

1114
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,910
at the beginning of the presentation.

1115
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,440
I'll start with the first one.

1116
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,930
You need to protect your
entire data pipeline.

1117
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,280
The Clumio Flick app, what
Sharon was using, was simple.

1118
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,740
Like I said, our CTO vibe
coded it in a weekend.

1119
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,170
Most likely you have
applications running in the cloud

1120
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,420
that are more complex,
that are multifaceted,

1121
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,240
that have detailed pipelines that involve

1122
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,020
maybe a dozen or a dozen
more services in AWS.

1123
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,230
It's very challenging
to be able to recover

1124
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,180
from something that
occurs to those services

1125
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,550
in that pipeline if you don't have,

1126
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,680
don't cover the entire pipeline all

1127
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,210
at once like Clumio does.

1128
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,880
That's what we recommend
as the first requirement

1129
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,430
for architecting for
resiliency in the AI world

1130
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,020
that we live in today.

1131
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,210
The second is speed.

1132
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,920
Sharon expects fast responses
from that smartphone app.

1133
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,550
AWS has been around for a long time

1134
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,860
and they've done a great
job at raising that bar

1135
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,540
to make sure that customers have speed

1136
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,500
in what they're doing in the AWS cloud.

1137
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,300
Clumio recognizes that and so
we have built an architecture

1138
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,500
that is built for that,

1139
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,110
so that you can have
a good user experience

1140
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,540
as often as you possibly can.

1141
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,920
Lastly, scale.

1142
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,500
We recognize that our app was very small.

1143
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,980
The watch lists were only
about 20 DynamoDB entries.

1144
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,950
We had about 5,000 or so S3 objects.

1145
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,480
We only had one S3 table.

1146
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,950
We only had one S3 vector.

1147
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:30,570
It's odds are your magnitudes
order larger than that.

1148
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,080
So Clumio has built their
product and their application

1149
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,400
and their solution along with Commvault

1150
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,180
to keep pace with that scale.

1151
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,670
We know that it's dynamically
changing every single day.

1152
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,880
We know that you're adding and
subtracting every single day.

1153
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,580
You need a solution to
increase that resiliency

1154
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,430
and maintain that
resiliency that will scale.

1155
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,440
Those are our three
recommendations for architecting,

1156
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,360
for best practices for the gen AI world

1157
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,620
that we live in today.

1158
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,080
But more generally speaking, we also,

1159
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,030
Clumio is a eight plus year old company.

1160
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,050
We've come to know what best
practices mean for the cloud.

1161
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,790
So we wanna provide you with some guidance

1162
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,130
in three different particular areas today

1163
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,420
before we leave you.

1164
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,600
The first is recovery in place matters.

1165
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,520
Not having to go to
the work and the effort

1166
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,050
to reconfigure your app after
you only recover partially

1167
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:22,770
will slow things down and
make your resiliency suffer.

1168
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,080
We wanna accelerate that
availability of that data

1169
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,860
so that sharing has minimal interruption

1170
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,650
or your businesses have
minimal interruption.

1171
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,630
The second is, like I
mentioned a second ago,

1172
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,250
the cloud is dynamic.

1173
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,230
I've been working on it
for about six years now.

1174
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,130
I was at AWS.

1175
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,180
I observed it firsthand.

1176
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,950
It changes every single day.

1177
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,360
It shrinks, it grows.

1178
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,550
So we wanna be able to
help you with discovering

1179
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,740
what already exists now,

1180
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,470
but also what has not been yet created.

1181
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,420
We have a part of the
product called Discover

1182
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,780
that will help automate
that level of protection.

1183
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,260
And then lastly, like I keep
saying, scale is huge in AWS.

1184
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,670
I don't see that slowing down.

1185
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:03,300
If anything, that'll accelerate
in the next 15, 20 years

1186
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,190
plus that AWS exists.

1187
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,080
So you need a product that will be elastic

1188
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,280
and scale with you.

1189
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,700
Clumio is a 100% serverless architecture

1190
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,170
that is built for scale.

1191
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,600
So that is our third best practice

1192
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,270
that we wanna provide with you today.

1193
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,890
I really enjoyed speaking with all of you

1194
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,630
on behalf of Akshay and myself.

1195
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,460
We don't want this conversation to end.

1196
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,880
We want it to continue, even
when you walk out those doors.

1197
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,710
So we wanna offer a few other things

1198
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,290
that we're doing before
re:Invent ends this week.

1199
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,600
The first is an AWS game day

1200
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,560
that starts at one o'clock tomorrow.

1201
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,320
It's gonna be a little bit of fun.

1202
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,270
It's gonna be a little bit of sci-fi.

1203
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,980
We're calling it Race to Recover,

1204
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,300
but it's based on a zombie
apocalypse or app-ocalypse

1205
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,160
is I guess how we're pronouncing
it on the screen there.

1206
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,930
You can see the QR code.

1207
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,350
I'll be there if you wanna
talk to me more there

1208
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,970
or after the session.

1209
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,170
I'm available 100%.

1210
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,600
I'll be there, like I said,
at one o'clock tomorrow.

1211
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,010
And then right after game day,

1212
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,290
we're gonna do a happy
