1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,030
- Welcome to MAM-217

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,903
Technical Deep Dive.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,070
We're gonna talk about
building composable AI agents

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,813
for partner solutions with AWS Transform.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,933
My name is Murtaza Chowdhury.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,813
I lead product management
in the AWS Transform Team,

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,220
and I'm going to be joined
by two esteemed colleagues,

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,913
Alexis and Ravi.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,690
And later in the presentation

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,810
we'll also have a partner join us

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,600
and show how they have worked with us

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,063
to build composable agents.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,410
Here's the roadmap for today.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,010
We're going to talk about the
journey with AWS Transform

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,860
and how we have started with

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,040
several point solutions
that we had at AWS.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,470
We combined them together to provide

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,190
a centralized experience
with consistency across

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,560
the different migrations,

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,380
and then how we are extending forward

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,050
to bring partners along with us

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,973
so that there is one unified
experience for customers.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,750
We are going to talk about

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,500
the components that enable composability,

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,033
we'll cover use cases,

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,250
we're also gonna touch upon best practices

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,950
that we recommend to our partners,

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,093
and we have several demos in this session.

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,290
And if you want to take
pictures, please feel free.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,963
Here's where we are with AWS Transform.

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,980
We made the service generally
available in May of this year.

32
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,960
If you're following the
announcements that we had this week,

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,300
the current state of the service is that

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,200
we have several specialized agents

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,290
for some of the key workloads
that we have identified

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,210
based on customer feedback,

37
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,330
which starts with migrating

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,143
on premises data center
workloads to the cloud,

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,980
which involves mapping
the technical artifacts

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,120
on premises to what it means in the cloud.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Like identifying things
like which applications,

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,220
which workloads should
be grouped together,

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,520
the servers, the
applications, the databases,

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,170
figuring out the mapping between

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,223
the networking topologies on
premises and in the cloud,

46
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,390
and that's what constitutes our
migration agents for VMware.

47
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,563
Then we have modernization for mainframes.

48
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,470
There are mainframes that have been built

49
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,400
several decades ago,

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,830
and customers have asked
us to help them identify

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,020
what those applications do,
comprehend those solutions.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,890
So, we have capabilities like

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,950
extracting business rules
out of legacy mainframes,

54
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,140
generating documents
which help them understand

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,970
what those applications do,

56
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,430
and taking the step forward

57
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,840
in terms of modernizing
them to modern languages

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,493
and migrating them to the cloud.

59
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:41,367
Then there are Microsoft
workloads, Windows.

60
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,967
We started with .NET workloads,

61
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,670
.NET framework based applications,

62
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,040
which are Windows bound.

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,450
And customers asked us to
provide them the ability

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,680
to make them compatible
with open source frameworks.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,480
So, where we started is helping
with agentic experiences

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,650
to convert .NET framework based
applications to .NET core,

67
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,650
which can be run on Linux
based either VMs or containers.

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,550
And this week, we expanded that experience

69
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,260
to become full-stack.

70
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,890
We included SQL server modernization there

71
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,240
so that when you are looking at

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,640
Microsoft workloads as a whole,

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,950
you can modernize not
only the application,

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,900
but also the databases along with them.

75
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,450
The fourth pillar that we have here

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,350
that we announced this week is Custom,

77
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:41,133
AWS Transform Custom.

78
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,080
We understand that the variety
that you have in workloads

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,683
and your needs in terms of
frameworks, applications, APIs,

80
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,190
cannot be just handled
with specialized agents.

81
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,410
We want to provide you the ability

82
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,980
so that you can scale based on your needs.

83
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,280
So what we offer with AWS Transform Custom

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
is a set of out of the box agents

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,580
for use cases like Java upgrades,

86
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,520
node upgrades, or Python upgrades.

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,053
And in addition to that,

88
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,070
you can build your own transformations

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,350
using AWS Transform Custom

90
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,033
by providing input/output
samples or documentation,

91
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,480
and you can create them centrally,

92
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,770
provide them to the practitioners
in your organization,

93
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,053
and have them run that at scale.

94
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,820
In addition to that, we
revamped the entire experience.

95
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,260
We have a new look and feel
in the user experience.

96
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,690
So what I'm showing you here is a glimpse

97
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,500
of the web application for AWS Transform.

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,410
We also have IDE-based plugins

99
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,623
for use cases like .NET and Java.

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,660
So, what you see here,

101
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,783
let me walk you through the
information hierarchy here.

102
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,070
To start with, we have workspaces,

103
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,660
think of them as the security boundary

104
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,550
or a collaboration space

105
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,100
where your teams can work together

106
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,760
and you can assign different
roles to your team members

107
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,830
based on how your teams are structured.

108
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,420
There can be administrators,
there can be contributors,

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,063
there can also be read-only users.

110
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,350
And within these workspaces,

111
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,460
your practitioners can
create different job types

112
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,210
based on the capabilities
that we talked about earlier.

113
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,130
And you see there are
four workspaces here,

114
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,860
one for VMware, one for
Windows, one for Mainframe,

115
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,063
and one for Custom.

116
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,560
You can have them together
as well if you want to have

117
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,420
multiple job types in the same workspace

118
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,400
or keep them separate depending on

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,440
how your teams are structured.

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,260
And within workspace are jobs,

121
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,280
that's where you can execute
those transformations.

122
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
And how jobs work is that

123
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,180
it assesses what your needs are,

124
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,070
it assesses what your environments have

125
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,743
and creates a job plan for you,

126
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,790
and then goes and executes
those steps in the job plans.

127
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,640
And the job plans comprises of several

128
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,740
task agents that we have.

129
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,740
In fact, across all the specialized agents

130
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,590
and custom transformation
that we have here,

131
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,980
there are dozens of task
agents that come together

132
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,373
to provide you this
seamless, unified experience.

133
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,090
And then we have the chat experience.

134
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,300
The entire experience
can be led through chat,

135
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,760
where practitioners, you yourself,

136
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,190
can chat with the agents

137
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,120
and the chat can recommend you next steps.

138
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,090
Human supervision is an important aspect.

139
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,240
Whenever there is
something to be reviewed,

140
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,617
the chat agent recommends,

141
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:15,393
and takes help from you
to take the next step.

142
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,570
We also have artifacts here.

143
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,500
Think of artifacts as the commonplace

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,640
where your digital footprint
of migration modernization

145
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,883
are stored for your team
members to work on it together.

146
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,030
And you can manage collaborators
there at a workspace level.

147
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,010
We also have connectors.

148
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,860
As you are migrating and
modernizing your applications,

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,340
you will need connectors based
on where your workloads are,

150
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,810
either it is on premises

151
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,760
or they're already running on the cloud,

152
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,710
and the connectors both on the source side

153
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,750
as well as on the destination side.

154
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,610
So you can manage all of that

155
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,623
in the boundary of a workspace here.

156
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,750
And an important aspect
of all of this is that

157
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,420
there is a continuous learning loop.

158
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,120
As you execute your migration

159
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,720
and modernization jobs
in that secure workspace,

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,470
the agents learn from what
your practitioners do,

161
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,060
and the next steps that it recommends

162
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,300
is based on that learning
that enriches over time,

163
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,893
the more and more you use it.

164
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,940
We have come a long way

165
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,270
where when we started,

166
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,620
we ourselves at AWS had dozens of tools

167
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,250
that were specialized for specific tasks.

168
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,470
Like, we had a separate
tool for migration,

169
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,870
we had bunch of tools for modernization,

170
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,360
for re-architecting, for mainframes.

171
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,060
So when we launched AWS Transform,

172
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,280
we brought them all together.

173
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,020
And what you see in AWS
Transform now is a consolidation

174
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,690
where all agents and
task agents work together

175
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,690
to provide you that seamless experience.

176
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,920
And what we have now,

177
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,740
while we have a singular experience for

178
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,890
execution of migration
and modernization needs,

179
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,460
we have partners which
most customers leverage

180
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,533
and the partners have their own tools.

181
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,090
So, we still lack a
single governance layer

182
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,980
across the partner tooling and
the tooling that have at AWS,

183
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,573
which in many cases led to
duplication and friction.

184
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,690
So what we bring you here today

185
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,090
with AWS Transform composability
is taking a step further

186
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,630
to what we did with our tools,

187
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,390
now, taking a step further to bring

188
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,570
the partner tools and solutions together

189
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,460
to have a centralized experience

190
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
for the practitioners and the customers.

191
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,380
So, if you are a partner
who is a migration

192
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,260
or a modernization competency provider,

193
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,390
you can integrate your tools,

194
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,150
your agents, and your knowledge bases.

195
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,300
If you have specialized
domain-rich experiences

196
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,530
on specialized industries,

197
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,690
you can bring them together to build

198
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,050
a cohesive experience in AWS Transform.

199
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,070
How it works together is
that there is AWS tooling,

200
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,270
there is partner tooling,

201
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,790
and then there is a personalized workflow,

202
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,500
which is customized based on

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,020
what you want to provide your customers.

204
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,360
And the practitioners and
the customers no longer

205
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,580
have to go to multiple places.

206
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,470
They see one seamless experience,

207
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,590
one seamless job type, or
an augmented knowledge base,

208
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,050
that they can execute centrally

209
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,643
and bring down the time and
effort to modernize and migrate.

210
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,250
Where we have come here is

211
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,173
from fragmented tooling to unified agents.

212
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,640
Not only is this bringing
together the experience,

213
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,020
it is also providing

214
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,663
a singular governance and security layer.

215
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,530
And our approach to this is that

216
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,560
we want to co-innovate with partners.

217
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,160
So, if you are a partner,
you have a solution in mind,

218
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,880
you have a functionality in
mind, you have existing tooling,

219
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,850
or if you are already in a
journey of building agents,

220
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,110
please talk to us.

221
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,200
We are going to work
with you and co-innovate,

222
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,910
and bringing those together,

223
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,823
and providing a central
experience to customers.

224
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,010
And the benefits are both for
partners as well as customers.

225
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,990
So if you are a partner,

226
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,830
you can differentiate yourself
with your specialized IP

227
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,850
and your domain knowledge

228
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,330
and create that personalized
and customized workflow.

229
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,203
And for customers, it is faster
migration and modernization.

230
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,490
So, here is what it looks like.

231
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,590
From a partner standpoint,

232
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,533
you start by telling us
what you want to build.

233
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,490
You can reach out to us either

234
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,900
via your partner development
manager or partner SA,

235
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,640
or if you're a partner,

236
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,280
you're already familiar
with Partner Central.

237
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,740
We are starting an experience there

238
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,790
where you can lodge a request
on what you want to build

239
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,940
with your business case and your solution,

240
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,400
and how you want to
differentiate yourself.

241
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,990
And then we build together

242
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,160
and then you can publish the
agents that you build with us.

243
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,390
And you have the flexibility

244
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,430
in how you publish those agents,

245
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,350
either within your own account

246
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,000
or within your customer account,

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,250
or if you want to make
it broadly available.

248
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,240
We also have the ability to
integrate with AWS Marketplace

249
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,783
and provide a SaaS-based
delivery from there.

250
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,990
And from a customer standpoint,

251
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,943
it's as simple as plug and play.

252
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,180
Customers or practitioners,

253
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,540
partners, if you are also a GSI or an SI,

254
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,050
you can simply enable
those published agents

255
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,910
and put them to use.

256
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,120
I'll show you what the
customer experience looks like

257
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,833
once the agents are published.

258
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,830
So, the starting of the AWS
Transform experience is,

259
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,593
is configuring and enabling
it in the AWS console.

260
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,150
So here, we have a new experience

261
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,920
called partner agents,

262
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,570
where any new agent that
is collaboratively built

263
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,993
by partners will be seen
once it's published.

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,920
And from a customer standpoint,
it can simply be enabled,

265
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,100
and once it's enabled,

266
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,413
it starts showing up in the workspace.

267
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,510
What you see here is a set of workspaces

268
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,070
that you might have,

269
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,523
and once that agent is enabled,
it shows up as a job type.

270
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
It also depends on what the use case is.

271
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,920
If you want to create a new
job type, it'll show up there.

272
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,750
If you're augmenting a knowledge base,

273
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,930
it will personalize an existing job type.

274
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,120
Or if you have another use case,

275
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,863
that'll be seen here as well.

276
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,640
Now that you have seen at a high level

277
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,190
how this thing will work,

278
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,940
I want to invite on
stage my colleague, Ravi,

279
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,190
who will talk about the components of it,

280
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,490
which makes this possible.

281
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,573
Ravi.

282
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,150
- Thank you, Murtaza.

283
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,160
Before we dive into the components,

284
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,750
let's basically take a step back

285
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,130
and look at what it means for you

286
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,480
to integrate your tools and
agents into AWS Transform,

287
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,460
because that's the basic
thing that you need to do

288
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,570
before you can take advantage

289
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,120
of the composability components.

290
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,430
So for that, I'm gonna start small, right?

291
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,320
And here, I've actually built
a simple tool agent, right?

292
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,610
This tool agent is similar to

293
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,860
what tools you may have yourselves, right?

294
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,170
Where this tool agent is helping with

295
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,940
network file conversion, right?

296
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,610
It follows a multi-step flow

297
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,710
to be able to get its work done.

298
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,560
It helps with converting
the network files,

299
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,330
which are stored in S3 bucket.

300
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,090
It analyzes them after downloading it

301
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,600
and then it verifies
for the proper content,

302
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,160
and then goes ahead and converts them

303
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,390
and finally uploads it into

304
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,540
another location in the same S3 bucket.

305
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,070
You don't have to worry too much about

306
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,930
the network file formats
and everything like that

307
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,470
because that's not the focus
of what I'm going to go for.

308
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,920
The mechanics and the overall
experience and outcome

309
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,380
doesn't change whether it's a simple agent

310
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,060
that I'm demonstrating here

311
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,890
versus something that you have yourselves,

312
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,890
like from a tools and agent's perspective.

313
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,210
So, let me kickstart the agent here.

314
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,310
So, what I have here is a local

315
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,657
development environment, right?

316
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,160
And this is my agent,

317
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm just gonna start running it.

318
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,280
And the agent is running
through its paces,

319
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,120
the tool agent,

320
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,820
and you can actually see what it's doing.

321
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,320
Let's pause here for a minute.

322
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,210
Once it's completed, you can actually see

323
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,520
all the text output in the terminal.

324
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,010
As you can see here,
it's very hard to follow

325
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,050
what the agent actually did.

326
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,730
There's no easy way for you to know

327
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,250
what are the distinct phases
that it actually went through

328
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,940
for you to know whether it's
performing properly or not.

329
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,070
So now, let's go ahead and think about

330
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,560
what you can do with AWS Transform.

331
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,490
To do that, what I've done
is taken the same tool agent,

332
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,370
integrated with our AWS
Transform package, right?

333
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,650
Which comes with base agent modules,

334
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,840
which allow you to easily integrate

335
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,630
with the AWS Transform primitives.

336
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,150
So here, as I continue,

337
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,920
you can actually see that
I'm gonna start running

338
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,920
the AWS Transform enabled tool agent.

339
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,820
You'll quickly identify that now you have

340
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,288
a listening capability added to the agent.

341
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:53,280
This is enabled by default
when you actually integrate

342
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,890
with the base agent module capability

343
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,590
that is provided with the AWS Transform.

344
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,540
And it also leverages
the AWS client's SDK,

345
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,120
and the other capabilities that help you

346
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,110
to integrate your tools and
agents into AWS Transform.

347
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,840
Okay, now this is on my local
development environment.

348
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,010
If I want to really see

349
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,590
how actually looks in the web application,

350
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,320
I'm gonna switch into the web application.

351
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,590
I'm firing up a browser,
and I'm going to the URL,

352
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,790
which basically will take me

353
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,280
to where the agent can actually be seen.

354
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,040
This is the first time
I'm running my browser,

355
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,340
and so this agent, the
browser, connecting to it,

356
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,100
so you'll actually see what's
happening is that it says,

357
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,510
okay, you cannot do it, right?

358
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,590
And you first need to go ahead

359
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,590
and make sure that you are
properly authenticated.

360
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,950
It's gonna throw me into
the username, password,

361
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,890
input mechanism for the identity provider

362
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,690
that I've been integrating here with.

363
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,810
Once I give the credentials,
it's happy with it,

364
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,240
and it's going to go ahead and redirect me

365
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,920
back after signing me
in, into the actual page,

366
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,903
which corresponds to my agent's job.

367
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
This is where it is.

368
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,340
So, I just want to reflect on something.

369
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,410
You are probably seeing
Murtaza's slides show

370
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,800
all the white background based theme.

371
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,050
You'll see here that I'm
actually showing a dark mode,

372
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,090
it's your preference, you
can choose whatever you want.

373
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,740
We now have all the capabilities

374
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,350
of being able to switch between
the themes quite seamlessly.

375
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,300
I'm a dark mode person, so I like this.

376
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,100
So now, let me go look at
what's in the job plan pane

377
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,200
that we typically talk about, right?

378
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,600
Oh wait, there's nothing in here.

379
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,830
Why is that so?

380
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,550
So what happened here is that
we basically kick started

381
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,670
the initialization process
of the agent locally,

382
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,650
but we have not still
given a command to it

383
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,770
to be able to say, start
your execution, right?

384
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,940
So how do you do this?

385
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,410
You do this by enabling the
capability that comes built in,

386
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,820
to be able to take
JSON-RPC or HTTP commands.

387
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,250
And this is all documented in the guide,

388
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,270
which is actually a accompanying

389
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,390
with the AWS Transform
integration package.

390
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,030
So, to avoid long command lines,

391
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,400
what I've done is basically
created a small script, right?

392
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,723
Which allows me to just go
ahead and, oh, sorry, shoot.

393
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,623
Okay.

394
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,430
Apologies for the mix up here.

395
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,300
Let me show you the...

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,050
Okay, I'll have to go through the demo

397
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,520
all from the beginning.

398
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,370
Sorry about that.

399
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,550
Okay, while it's running
through the paces,

400
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,600
I'll probably just go through

401
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,520
and explain what it's gonna do, right?

402
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,210
So, the first thing you do
is you initialize your agent.

403
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,880
The next thing you basically
do is start running your agent.

404
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,960
And for running your agent,

405
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,260
you have to use JSON-RPC
or HTTP commands, right?

406
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,600
Which are basically documented as part of

407
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,900
the package that you received
in the documentation guide.

408
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,130
And when you do that,

409
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,910
then you can go back and
see your agent executing

410
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,023
in the web app itself.

411
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,070
And here, it's actually going
back, again to the login page,

412
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,020
because I'm rerunning the demo for you.

413
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,080
But pretty soon we'll get to the point

414
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,700
where you'll be able to go ahead

415
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,697
and see the agent in action.

416
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:27,210
Okay, we are back at the
place where we started.

417
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,380
The job has been initialized,

418
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,940
but it's not been executing yet.

419
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,070
So I'm gonna run my script,

420
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,450
which basically allows me to go ahead

421
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,540
and kickstart the JSON-RPC
command I talked about, right?

422
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,220
And now I'm gonna switch back.

423
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,580
Now I'm gonna open back the job plan.

424
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,860
The job plan is a place
where you will be able to see

425
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,650
what is the thing that the
agent is gonna do, right?

426
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,630
As you can see it quickly populated it

427
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,590
with what it's gonna do.

428
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,090
This is the plan of execution

429
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,790
of what the agent is gonna do by itself.

430
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,420
So you can crisply see
what all the salient phases

431
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,590
it's actually going to go through

432
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,450
to be able to get its job done.

433
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,360
So now as it keeps
executing more and more,

434
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
you'll actually start seeing that it'll go

435
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,110
and complete one step at a time,

436
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,270
as you can see here,
just completed step one.

437
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,780
Let's look into the
artifact work logs, right?

438
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,250
So here, you have the work log,

439
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,390
which basically allows you to
see the progress of the job

440
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,510
as the agent is executing
it, one at a time.

441
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,700
And also you can refer back
to it, like, what happened,

442
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,160
if you are not in front of your computer.

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,110
So as the agent is running through,

444
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,970
well, let's keep go
back and we'll see that

445
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,743
it's completing multiple steps.

446
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,590
And again, we'll go back into the work log

447
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,770
and you'll see that it's
populating the work log entries.

448
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,770
What it's actually helped you
do is to be able to go ahead

449
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,880
and say that I have a
very crisp understanding

450
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,190
of what my agent is actually doing, right?

451
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,390
And if something goes wrong,

452
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,850
I can go back and look at what went wrong.

453
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,070
It was much harder for
us if you think about

454
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,550
the case we started with, right?

455
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,660
Where you have a terminal and
you have all the log messages,

456
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,010
all interspersed.

457
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,910
You could probably say,

458
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,950
oh, I could probably go
ahead and integrate it

459
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,660
with some other tool and look at it,

460
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,840
but it takes time and effort
to be able to do that.

461
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,600
With AWS Transform, you get all these

462
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,880
in a very easy integration package.

463
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,190
So, now that we've looked
at some of the capabilities,

464
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,480
let's go look at what all does
AWS Transform help you with.

465
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,313
Okay.

466
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,090
Security.

467
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,990
Security is the underpinnings
of AWS Transform.

468
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,270
As you have seen, no
one can easily connect

469
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,580
to the agent without being authenticated.

470
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,560
By integrating with AWS Transform,

471
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,470
you enable your tools and
agents to seamlessly integrate

472
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,080
with the enterprise identity providers.

473
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,860
Every action in AWS Transform
needs to be authorized.

474
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,100
And we all know how hard
it is to be able to deal

475
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,560
with credential lifecycle management,

476
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,080
getting the credentials, refreshing them,

477
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,960
renewing them at the right interval,

478
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,420
and also handling revocations

479
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,490
is a critical but painful aspect

480
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,043
of being able to manage connectivity.

481
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:03,300
AWS Transform's built-in capabilities

482
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,870
offload this pain off your development,

483
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,360
so that you can actually focus
more on your business logic

484
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,387
and not worry about all these other things

485
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:14,190
that basically are painful, right?

486
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,170
And you've actually seen
some of the capabilities

487
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,870
where you can look at what
the agent has been performing

488
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,770
and you can actually get audit trails.

489
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,950
So, Murtaza talked about AWS Transform

490
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,370
being built for
collaboration in mind, right?

491
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,880
By using the workspaces and the roles,

492
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,600
you can delegate job responsibility
among your team members

493
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,380
while approvals provide
the critical oversight

494
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,380
for very, very large blast
radius based actions, right?

495
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,690
And by integrating with AWS Transform,

496
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,540
you get to leverage a
secure artifact storage,

497
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,950
which has data encryption at
rest capabilities built in.

498
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,100
It also allows you to take an optional

499
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,710
customer managed key by
integrating with KMS,

500
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,740
which is AWS Key Management Service.

501
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,740
And your agents can help you

502
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,780
prevent and detect abuses

503
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,533
by leveraging the built-in
capabilities from AWS Transform.

504
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,470
We all know how painful it is to be able

505
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,510
to impose this on our customers,

506
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,770
so we don't want to do that.

507
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,930
And so, by integrating with AWS Transform,

508
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,930
you get all these four very,
very easy integration effort.

509
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,810
The next aspect that we want to talk about

510
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,390
is basically how you can actually

511
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,730
seamlessly see the workflow

512
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,590
from the agent being executed.

513
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,930
You saw the job plan being orchestrated

514
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,053
and how easy it was to follow
what the agent was doing.

515
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,490
The job plan management or
orchestration capabilities

516
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,080
of AWS Transform span the
entire life cycle of the agent.

517
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,740
So, it enables both single
agent based workflows

518
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,863
for orchestration and also
multi-agent orchestration flows.

519
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,040
AWS Transform helps your agent gain

520
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,540
human to agent interactions

521
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,180
by enabling the human-in-the-loop

522
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,490
or the HITL pattern, which
is the most common pattern

523
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,710
for human to agent interaction,

524
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,560
and also agent to agent interactions.

525
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,290
So, once you are ready
with building your agent,

526
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,930
you've tested it, all
this good stuff is done,

527
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,180
you want to go ahead
and deploy your agents.

528
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,650
So how would you deploy agent is,

529
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,010
normally is you probably acquire compute

530
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,570
and then you have to provision them

531
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,933
and you have to go ahead
and plan for the capacity.

532
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,650
AWS Transform comes with
built-in integration

533
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,780
with Bedrock AgentCore runtime.

534
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,780
This allows you to use
the on-demand capabilities

535
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,450
to be able to seamlessly scale
your compute requirements.

536
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,650
The optional autonomous
mode that you can enable

537
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,770
can allow your agents to run
without human intervention,

538
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,020
if your agents need that.

539
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,230
The agents can also harden
themselves against faults,

540
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,870
and be resilient to failures

541
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,240
by leveraging the check
pointing capabilities

542
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,840
that AWS Transform provides you.

543
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,490
And as you run your agents in production,

544
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,220
one of the things you wanna
do is to be able to monitor

545
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,370
how they're doing and
also respond to events.

546
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,790
AWS Transform's built-in
integration capabilities

547
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,520
help you get the appropriate
logging, the tracing,

548
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,580
and the metrics that you
need to be able to monitor

549
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,160
and put together robust dashboards,

550
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,610
and set up alarms so that
you can react to events.

551
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,220
So, thus far what we've
seen is how you can take

552
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,320
your existing tools and agents

553
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,330
and how you can integrate
into AWS Transform

554
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,130
and light up your capabilities

555
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,563
to become more enterprise friendly.

556
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,670
So now let's look at how you can use this

557
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,670
to be able to build more
complex composed workflows

558
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,430
to be able to achieve larger
transformation outcomes.

559
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,720
So, what does it actually mean
to have a composed workflow?

560
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,300
In the composed workflow
your tools and agents

561
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,700
work seamlessly with
other tools and agents,

562
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,130
both from AWS and from other partners,

563
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,960
to be able to achieve much more

564
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,520
complex transformation outcomes

565
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,180
that you cannot achieve in yourselves,

566
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,950
with just your tools and agents.

567
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,650
So that's the advantage of
having a composed workflow.

568
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,710
So, the topic of my
section was components,

569
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,140
now we are gonna dive into what
are the different components

570
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,480
that you can use to make this composition

571
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,503
much more seamless?

572
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,230
So, as we talked about earlier,

573
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,750
we have the base agent
modules that are shipped

574
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,550
with the AWS Transformation package,

575
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,800
which allow you to seamlessly integrate

576
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,310
with AWS Transform capabilities,

577
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,280
like the work log, the artifact store,

578
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,900
the job plan management,

579
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,090
and so on, so forth, that we talked about.

580
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,650
You can supercharge your agents

581
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,090
with domain specific knowledge

582
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,440
that is very, very, very
important for your businesses

583
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,970
by integrating with the built-in

584
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,580
knowledge base integration capability.

585
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,510
And we talked about

586
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,550
the Bedrock AgentCore runtime integration,

587
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,010
which allows you to deploy your agents

588
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,100
in a secure VPC-based environment

589
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,930
even with private networks.

590
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,060
And finally, when you are ready to be able

591
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,390
to have the agents
consumed by other agents

592
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,570
or be discoverable by other customers,

593
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,420
you can actually use the
agent registry mechanism

594
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,720
that's provided for you
through AWS Transform.

595
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,050
So, to get you quickly started on

596
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,900
the overall transformation
flow, this is how it looks like.

597
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,980
We started with step one,

598
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,530
where we were at the
dev build environment,

599
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,000
we used the AWS Strands
agents and the AgentCore SDK,

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,270
and using the base agent
modules to be able to

601
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,090
light up the core
capabilities of what it means

602
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,830
to integrate the AWS Transform.

603
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,020
We were able to test it
on a local environment,

604
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,670
and then once we were happy,

605
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,410
the next step is basically to leverage

606
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,350
Amazon's ECR capabilities
to build an image

607
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,770
which you can just go ahead and upload

608
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,980
into your own AWS account
and run on AgentCore runtime.

609
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,810
And what this allowed
you to do is to be able

610
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,060
to go test as if it's gonna run

611
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,070
in production in your customer's account

612
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,630
when it's deployed there.

613
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,920
And to be able to make sure

614
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,020
that you can interact with this agent,

615
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,900
you need to go ahead and
use the agent registry

616
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,390
to make it discoverable,
we talked about it earlier.

617
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,390
Once you're done with
this, you're good, right?

618
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,430
You can go ahead and use
the chat capabilities,

619
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,350
that Murtaza talked about earlier,

620
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,060
to be able to interact with agent,

621
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,940
or your other agents can seamlessly

622
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,160
discover the capabilities of your agent

623
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,860
and be able to do agent to
agent interactions as well.

624
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,650
So, in a nutshell, this
is what the overall

625
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,570
agent building experience looks like.

626
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,670
We started with the build capabilities

627
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,320
where with AWS Transform's
lifecycle management,

628
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,770
memory and the knowledge
base integration, everything,

629
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,990
how you can build a very integrated

630
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,840
and supercharged
experience for your agents.

631
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,140
We did some local testing,
and we tested for correctness.

632
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,330
The next step is automatically
to be able to go ahead

633
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,340
and deploy it for your customers use.

634
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,960
As Murtaza mentioned, again,

635
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
you can use AWS Marketplace as one of

636
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,740
the distribution channels
to be able to get it out

637
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,000
to your customers so that they can use it.

638
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,330
And we also touched upon
briefly on how you can operate

639
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,720
and monitor your agents when
they're deployed at scale.

640
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,550
Now that we have talked
about how you can take

641
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,610
your agents and integrate into AWS

642
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,683
and start building a composed workflow,

643
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,850
let's look at how you can
do more in terms of what

644
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,770
you can scale your development
environment experience

645
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,570
and also to be able to walk through

646
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,190
some of the use cases that you can achieve

647
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,530
that we've been able to
achieve with partners.

648
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,480
For that, let me invite Alexi on stage.

649
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,050
- Thank you, Ravi.

650
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,210
So, when we started thinking
about composability,

651
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,640
a few questions pop up to our mind.

652
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,280
Typically, can we do
better with our agent?

653
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,580
Can we enable more capability?

654
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,900
Can they actually start to
have their own kind of thinking

655
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,363
if we provide them with more knowledges?

656
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,220
Because it is true that
us, as human being,

657
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,670
the more knowledge we have,
the more reasoning we can do.

658
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,620
So that is one point that
I would like to present

659
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,353
to you today in the
upcoming demonstration.

660
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,310
Another element is
assuming we want to be able

661
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,085
to build more capable agent,

662
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:36,085
how can we give you the capability
to deploy your own agent

663
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,880
and own knowledge bases in
existing workflows in Transform

664
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,403
or build your own workflows
with your own agent?

665
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,920
The third question that we ask ourself is,

666
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,590
can we actually drive business

667
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,560
and technical transformation
simultaneously?

668
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,800
Because when we do a
migration, we do generally,

669
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,873
we generally do it for a business reason.

670
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,780
We are not migrating VMware

671
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,970
or business intelligence reports,

672
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,040
or mainframe, or .NET application,

673
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,880
just because we want to get
rid of the technical debt.

674
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,230
It's a reason,

675
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,260
but there is always an
expected business outcome.

676
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,720
So, we need the agent to be able

677
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,710
to help us assess priority, risk,

678
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,780
do waste planning, okay?

679
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,450
So we want our agent and your agent

680
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,423
to be able to develop those
emerging capabilities.

681
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,590
So, that leads us to another question,

682
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,390
if we consider that agent is
a group of digital people,

683
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,790
what makes a group smart?

684
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,297
So, usually when it comes to
agent, people are going to say,

685
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:51,120
"Well, they need tools,

686
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,983
they need knowledge bases,

687
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,190
they need memory."

688
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,840
But the reality is that if we
look at how we manage teams,

689
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,840
a group is smarter when people
can communicate together,

690
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,480
when they know how to share knowledge.

691
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,300
So, the use case I'm
going to present to you

692
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,750
is about, I would say, flexible reasoning,

693
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,180
it's not based on a study graph.

694
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,480
Agents are going to communicate
directly one to each other,

695
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,570
share information, and
come up with conclusion

696
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,320
and create new type of data
that did not exist before.

697
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,843
So, they're developing
emerging capability.

698
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,080
So, in this use case,

699
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,170
I'm an application manager
in the financial industry.

700
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,070
I'm owning a set of, I would say,

701
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,520
banking application,
and I'm based in Europe,

702
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,400
and unfortunately Europe
released a new regulation

703
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,710
this year, the DORA Act.

704
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,500
So know if you're operating in Europe,

705
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,000
you must prove that you're
managing your system properly

706
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,610
in case of failure, outage,

707
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,050
if a transaction goes well,

708
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,603
you need to be able to
notify your customers.

709
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,840
So when I look at that,

710
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,630
my first reaction as an
application owner is,

711
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,693
well, how can I know that
my system is built properly?

712
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,970
How can I do that?

713
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,760
And can I actually automatically detect

714
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,360
if my application are compliant
to that new regulation?

715
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,823
If not, how can I remediate that?

716
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,070
And I'm unfortunate,

717
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,780
because it happens to be
a mainframe application,

718
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,240
so it makes my life even more complex.

719
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,350
So, in this scenario, I'm
going to create a new agent,

720
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,760
the DORA agent here.

721
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,293
Oops, sorry about that.

722
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm going to reuse an
existing mainframe agent,

723
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
the BRE agent,

724
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,250
which is extracting
business rules from code,

725
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,260
and I'm going to use Kiro

726
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,870
for both building my agentic system

727
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,070
and for doing the
remediation automatically.

728
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,030
The way it works,

729
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,310
the BRE is going to extract business rules

730
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,083
from the legacy source code.

731
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,280
I have created, and I show
that to you in a moment,

732
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
a knowledge base, the raw knowledge base,

733
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,140
which basically describe the DORA Act,

734
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,440
and I have created steering files for Kiro

735
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,310
to actually explain how to
create a proper architecture

736
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,870
for transaction management

737
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,553
or for managing customer
account, and similar examples.

738
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,020
So, I'll take you through
the first demonstration,

739
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,440
which is the building of that agent.

740
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,710
So, I am in Kiro, we have an MCP server

741
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,740
that can guide you and
automate the building

742
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,600
of something we call base agent,

743
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,450
which is basically what
Ravi introduced you to.

744
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,810
And in this examples,
I'm just asking to Kiro,

745
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,550
well, in AWS Transform,
and what is a base agent?

746
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,390
So, you can ask any
question from within Kiro

747
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,810
and you can be guided step by
step about what Transform is,

748
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,263
what are the capabilities
that Ravi introduced you to.

749
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,810
So in that case it's saying,

750
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,960
well, it's basically a foundation

751
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,280
where you have different agent

752
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,830
that can communicate one to each other,

753
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,090
they can interact,

754
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,704
you can deploy them to AgentCore,

755
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:19,170
and you have a registry of agent

756
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,120
to have a Marketplace-like experience,

757
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,920
and it's based on something
called base agent,

758
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,600
which is basically an improvement

759
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,450
over the vanilla Strands agent

760
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,700
so that those agent knows
how to communicate together

761
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,130
and make usage of the artifacts

762
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,953
or the human-in-the-loop
that Ravi presented you with.

763
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,320
So, from there I can interact with Kiro

764
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,880
and ask follow up question,

765
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,080
and I'm going to ask,
what is a base agent,

766
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,740
what can I do with a base
agent and how do they interact?

767
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,293
How can I equip a base agent with tools?

768
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,670
So, Kiro is going to
answer all those questions,

769
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,610
I'm going to go through a few of them.

770
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,620
Like, typically at the moment,

771
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,030
I don't know if you can see it,

772
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,030
but Kiro is giving more information

773
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,770
about what base agent are.

774
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,740
And basically, we have
two type of base agents,

775
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,740
we have orchestrator base
agent and we have subagent.

776
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,290
So, the orchestrator are there to be able

777
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,560
to do the reasoning part
at scale, basically,

778
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,740
while the subagent are
more task specific, okay?

779
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,910
And typically to declare a subagent,

780
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,060
all you have to do is use a
tool decorator from Strands,

781
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,810
register the tools into
the agent, and you're done.

782
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,280
Everything that Ravi explained to you is,

783
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,050
you don't have to worry
about it basically,

784
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,393
because you're iterating
from the base agent.

785
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,190
It is the same thing for an orchestrator.

786
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,910
So, in the next step I'm going to ask Kiro

787
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,670
to implement an orchestrator,

788
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,820
and I'm going to ask
Kiro basically to explain

789
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,220
how the messaging and
communication happens

790
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,860
between the various agents, right?

791
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,403
So Kiro is generating an
example for me at the moment,

792
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,260
and it generates an
orchestrator and a few subagent,

793
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,430
and basically it's going to
explain to me with a diagram

794
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,620
how the communication works over here.

795
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,200
So, if I do a pause for a moment here,

796
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,110
we see that basically I have my,

797
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,500
I have two tools which are
used into the orchestrator.

798
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,250
One is basically a tool
to contact the registry

799
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,633
that we spoke before,

800
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,280
which allows that agent to
retrieve a list of subagent

801
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,340
and other orchestrator,
it is allowed to talk to,

802
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,900
so you have control over
the visibility of agents.

803
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,820
And the second tool
which is going to be used

804
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,260
is a send message,

805
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,260
and basically you are allowing that agent

806
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,850
to talk to other agents,

807
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,090
and that's how you have
control over your communication

808
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,420
between the different agent
and their capabilities.

809
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,833
It is as simple as that.

810
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,690
So, moving on here, the
diagram explains the same thing

811
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,840
and how the messages are going to jump

812
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,260
from one agent to, or for the insured API,

813
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,420
and then be redirected

814
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,363
to another agent based on the agent name.

815
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,100
In order to save time,

816
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,100
I'm going to go to the part
where I'm actually asking,

817
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,420
sorry about that,

818
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,420
Kiro to generate the entire system for me,

819
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,903
if I can make it happen.

820
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,983
Okay.

821
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,010
So, I stay here for moment,

822
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,450
I'm sorry there's an issue.

823
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,610
So, I've been asking to Kiro

824
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,030
to take the example I provided to it,

825
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,460
and basically take me
through the different step

826
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,060
to basically package the agent,

827
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,517
create an ECR image,

828
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:07,680
push this ECR image
AgentCore, register the agent,

829
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,610
and Kiro implemented the
pipeline end-to-end for me

830
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,610
so I don't have to basically
know how those APIs works

831
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,810
and I can actually automate the making

832
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,123
and deploying of an agent.

833
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,273
The second demonstration,

834
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,770
it is about the creation
of the DORA agent.

835
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,590
So basically what I've been doing here

836
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,610
is I have created three
different sets of data.

837
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,360
One is the translation of the DORA Act

838
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,590
into YAML file over here,

839
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,710
which describe each and every act.

840
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,710
Their, I would, say main
functional features and capability.

841
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,250
It has been done
automatically using an LLM

842
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,500
and the DORA Act itself.

843
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,620
And from there I have
described the DORA act

844
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,113
per business domain and per feature.

845
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,890
Once this has been done,

846
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:21,780
we create an equivalent knowledge
base for the remediation.

847
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,110
So, it is a set of Kiro steering files

848
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,680
with a YAML font matter, same trick,

849
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,850
where we actually describe
the features and capability

850
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,790
that we want to be able to interact with

851
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,890
or to develop with Kiro.

852
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,760
And then we have a longer description

853
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,590
of the remediation when
we want to use Kiro for,

854
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,240
I would say, transforming the code

855
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,340
that we currently have in our application.

856
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:54,660
Okay, that agent is completely generic.

857
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,220
If you have different
kind of knowledge into it,

858
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,360
it'll be able to automate the remediation

859
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,423
of your application based
on the additional rules.

860
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,910
And now, I'm going to
use that new DORA agent

861
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,210
into a subset of the
existing mainframe workflow.

862
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,890
So, I'm selecting, as we
speak, as I speak, sorry,

863
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,650
the couple files that I want to

864
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,543
investigate in that application,

865
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,350
Transform is going to
extract the business rules,

866
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,650
it's going then to let the DORA agent

867
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,230
connect to the BRE agent.

868
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,600
They are going to have
a discussion together,

869
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,840
and basically the DORA agent
is going to get back to us

870
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,670
with a list of recommendation.

871
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,630
So it's doing similarity
analysis between the DORA Act,

872
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,610
which I put into a knowledge base,

873
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,900
and the extracted business
rule from the source code.

874
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,200
So that allows to do, I would say,

875
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,750
a functional similarity detection.

876
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:55,770
And here is the result that
I'm having, in this case,

877
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,850
where the DORA agent detected 24 rules

878
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,620
that are completely aligned

879
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,320
with transaction
management in the DORA Act,

880
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,403
and is recommending to
modify 20 of those, okay?

881
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,200
The detailed remediation are
saved into the artifact store

882
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,020
and can be used by Kiro,

883
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,750
but I'm getting a report in the chat,

884
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:23,750
which basically tells
me which DORA regulation

885
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,850
should be enforced in the application.

886
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,410
And then in the next stage

887
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:31,140
I'm getting the list of business rules

888
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,300
that I should actually enforce,

889
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,070
and I'm getting a link to
every Kiro steering file

890
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,620
that has been produced
automatically by the agent

891
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,103
to automate the transformation
of the code from within Kiro.

892
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,033
I'm going to,

893
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,483
so basically,

894
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,170
the use case was developed based on

895
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,050
the existing BRE agent from mainframe,

896
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,120
the code analysis agent from mainframe,

897
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,500
and the new DORA agent,

898
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,020
and then we push all of that to Kiro.

899
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,490
We could have included more
agent like DSMF agent to know,

900
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,070
I would say, like the
usage of those transaction

901
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,950
on the real system and
see their criticality,

902
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,040
and get more, I would say, recommendation,

903
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,440
because maybe that
transaction is highly critical

904
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,757
or is used only once a year,

905
00:45:20,757 --> 00:45:23,043
and I have more time to do my remediation.

906
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,950
So, the best practices when
you're developing agent is

907
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,880
you need to think about
them as intelligent modules.

908
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,230
So you want to expose
their capability as skills

909
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,790
by using the tool, leg corrector,

910
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,860
that we've seen previously,

911
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,780
so that they can negotiate

912
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,543
how they're going to interact, basically.

913
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,810
When they need to share data,

914
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,260
you want to make sure that
the way the data is saved

915
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,810
in the artifact store
is known to the agent

916
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,210
so you can basically create a skills

917
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,310
where they describe the
schema of their data

918
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,410
so that they know to how to interact.

919
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,840
Or you may want do, like I just did,

920
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,120
put the data into a knowledge base

921
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,060
because then the retriever
is going to enable the agent

922
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,163
to directly exchange data, okay?

923
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,740
I'm now inviting Murtaza to introduce us

924
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,940
with the next use cases.

925
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,460
- Thank you, Alexi.

926
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,180
Several partners have been working with us

927
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,393
as design partners to
build new capabilities,

928
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:36,273
and one such capability is
BI migration to Quick Suite.

929
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,060
I'm going to invite Naveen on stage

930
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,250
to talk about Wavicle Data Solutions,

931
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,200
and how they have been working with us.

932
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:44,963
Naveen.

933
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,980
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

934
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,720
- Good afternoon everyone.

935
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,550
I'm Naveen Venkatapathi,

936
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,883
co-founder and managing partner
at Wavicle Data Solutions.

937
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,760
We work with enterprises to help modernize

938
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,430
and build compossible data platforms,

939
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,910
and one of the ways we have
taken this to a new level

940
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,550
with Transform is that we have combined

941
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,740
our proprietary accelerators

942
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,270
and the powerful orchestration
layer AWS Transform brings.

943
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,630
We have combined these two
to build specialized agents

944
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,610
that can help our AWS
customers or other AWS partners

945
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,660
to be able to leverage
these specialized agents

946
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,090
to be able to drive the modernization

947
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,670
at a incredibly high velocity,

948
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,260
and lower labor arbitrage
to be able to drive

949
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,100
value to our customers
very, very quickly as well.

950
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,850
One of the things that
AWS Transform gives us

951
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,860
is the capability to not only build

952
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,250
these specialized agents
at a very fast paced way,

953
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,030
but it also helps create
a very, very flexible

954
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,390
customer experience on a very simple

955
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,820
chat-like interface as well.

956
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,560
I invite my colleague Anantha

957
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,230
to demonstrate our specialized agent

958
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,693
and how we have built this on
the AWS Transform platform.

959
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:11,526
Thank you.

960
00:48:12,658 --> 00:48:13,658
- Thank you.

961
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,540
So, hello everyone.

962
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,920
My name is Anantha Choppalli.

963
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,770
I'm chief architect for AWS practice

964
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,780
within Wavicle Data Solutions.

965
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,890
And by partnering with AWS Transform team,

966
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,100
we have been able to take advantage

967
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,800
of the platform's inbuilt capabilities,

968
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,300
where we are now able
to bring our solution,

969
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,903
which has high impacting and
high value for our customers,

970
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,350
for quicker adoption by the customers.

971
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,050
In this case, a BI migration solution

972
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,700
that helps customers migrate from

973
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,690
their existing BI legacy
platforms over to Quick Suite,

974
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,840
and specifically the
QuickSight part of it.

975
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,990
There are several
advantages that we have seen

976
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,800
working with AWS Transform team
over the last several weeks,

977
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,410
where we have seen that

978
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,810
we can actually accelerate innovation

979
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,670
without the procurement delays.

980
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,970
What I mean by that is that we are able

981
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,230
to bring our solutions to
the customers very quickly,

982
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,520
which the customers would
be able to adopt very fast,

983
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,093
and without having to go through
longer procurement delays,

984
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,360
which could take several cycles

985
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,930
and requires heavy paperwork.

986
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,760
So, if you are a partner or a customer,

987
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,253
you know what I mean by those,

988
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,880
think about non-disclosure agreements,

989
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,060
master service agreements,
statements of work,

990
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,460
and not to mention any
change requests, and so on.

991
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,410
So all of those can be eliminated,

992
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,840
because the solution is
now easily accessible

993
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,273
in a self-service manner.

994
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,960
Another advantage that I would say

995
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,690
is enhanced is security posture.

996
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,840
While Wavicle, as a
premier consulting partner,

997
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,960
brings best-in-class
solution to our customers,

998
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,070
rooted with best practices and
well-architected framework,

999
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:15,600
there are often concerns from
customers about their data.

1000
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,720
So, there are data concerns leaving

1001
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,930
their network and data security

1002
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,740
and privacy related things, not anymore.

1003
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,600
Wavicle Solution now runs on
Bedrock AgentCore runtime,

1004
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,680
which includes the security
poster that's offered in-built,

1005
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,550
as well as now customers
can take advantage

1006
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:42,390
of running the AgentCore runtime

1007
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,510
100% within their environment.

1008
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,200
So, this means there is
no need for additional

1009
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,750
risk assessments or InfoSec reviews

1010
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,843
because their data does
not leave their network.

1011
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,690
So, you know what this means,

1012
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,503
what happens to their data
stays in their environment.

1013
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,700
And lastly, our offering is available

1014
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,480
through the very familiar
Marketplace deployment channel,

1015
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,700
that means customers
do not have to navigate

1016
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,720
through newer procurement channels.

1017
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,470
They can get the access to the offering

1018
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,870
through Marketplace with the same channels

1019
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,520
they're very familiar with.

1020
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,850
And the next advantage, I would say,

1021
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,630
is a rapid time-to-value for POCs,

1022
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:35,630
where customers can take
advantage of doing quick POCs

1023
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,640
without having to think
about the paperwork.

1024
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,780
And this actually helps them
validate the product fit

1025
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,240
for their use cases
before they can actually

1026
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,343
think about full fledged migrations.

1027
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,110
And lastly, I would say this
actually helps customers

1028
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:56,250
unlock a better, faster cost-effective way

1029
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,950
and self-service part to ROI.

1030
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,620
What I mean by that is
customers can actually

1031
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,260
do the entire BI platform assessment

1032
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,380
that typically takes
several weeks to months

1033
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,360
in few minutes to hours,

1034
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,120
and once they have the exhaustive report,

1035
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,550
as something that we will look at shortly,

1036
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,320
as part of the demo,

1037
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,900
they can actually use that information

1038
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,850
to come up with an ROI,

1039
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,340
which they can take
for internal approvals.

1040
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,290
And all of this, once they're
ready, they can either,

1041
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,510
if they have the skill sets internally,

1042
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,880
they can use the self-service mechanism

1043
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,010
to migrate all of their
reports and dashboards

1044
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,950
to Amazon Quick Suite or QuickSight.

1045
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,660
Alternatively, they can use

1046
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,060
the Whitecloak consulting engagement

1047
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,570
by partnering with their
existing SIs or GSIs

1048
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,180
or even reach out to
Wavicle Data Solutions,

1049
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,753
because we have done it several
times over, and over again.

1050
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,140
So, with that context,

1051
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,470
let's take a look at the demo.

1052
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:03,000
And in this particular
case before I move on,

1053
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,080
we'll be looking at the Power BI Analyzer,

1054
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,910
where we'll be first looking
at the Power BI interface,

1055
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,470
if you are familiar with that,

1056
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:17,430
the Power BI reports in the workspaces,

1057
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,740
and we would look at how we can use

1058
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,430
the guided self-service
AWS Transform approach

1059
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,498
where customers can with
help of a natural language

1060
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:30,090
interact with the Transform platform

1061
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,883
and help analyze their entire BI platform.

1062
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,223
So with that,

1063
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,070
like I said,

1064
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,923
first we will look at the Power BI,

1065
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,300
Power BI workspace.

1066
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,290
And workspace in Power BI is very similar

1067
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,690
to a folder in a QuickSight.

1068
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,993
And in this case, we have
three reports in the Power BI.

1069
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,530
So one of them, the first one,

1070
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,470
is a low complexity dashboard,

1071
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,020
in which case there's one filter,

1072
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,570
there are a couple of
different types of charts,

1073
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:13,443
and there are a few KPIs
and metrics that we have.

1074
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,120
The second report is a high complex report

1075
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,530
and the complexity is based on

1076
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:24,530
how many objects are used in
creating those dashboards.

1077
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,170
And as you can see here, we
have different types of charts

1078
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,500
from heat map to pie
chart, and bar charts,

1079
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,230
and there are some custom actions

1080
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,610
that once someone clicks on it,

1081
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,460
it actually does something specific.

1082
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,300
And lastly, a very high
complexity report where again,

1083
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,830
there are several
different types of charts

1084
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,150
that customer has.

1085
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:52,080
And think about this in the multitudes

1086
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,830
of hundreds of thousands of
reports in a enterprise setup.

1087
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,230
So migrating one or two is easy,

1088
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,600
but when you want to do it at scale,

1089
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,810
AWS Transform and Wavicle's
BI migration offering

1090
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,710
would help.

1091
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,620
In this case, the customer would navigate

1092
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,660
to the AWS Transform,

1093
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,410
select the right offering
for the Power BI Analyzer,

1094
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,610
and create a job.

1095
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,940
What this does is it actually
starts the AgentCore runtime

1096
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,910
within the customer's environment
to set up the environment,

1097
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,540
and then you can actually
start interacting

1098
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,250
with the Transform platform

1099
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:30,597
where you would ask it to
analyze your Power BI workspaces

1100
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,030
and either you can actually
provide new credentials

1101
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,370
or use connectors that's preset up

1102
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,500
to connect to your Power BI service

1103
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,000
and ask for all the Power BI
workspaces that are available.

1104
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,280
Once you see all the Power BI workspaces,

1105
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,950
you can ask it to select
a specific workspace

1106
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,450
that you want to focus,

1107
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,670
and then you can either analyze one

1108
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,610
or all of the reports
within that workspace.

1109
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:00,690
And as we can see, it actually
does a quick check to the S3,

1110
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,870
because any intermediary
log files on all the data

1111
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,970
gets stored in your S3 bucket.

1112
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,600
And while this actually connects
and performs the activity

1113
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,390
of analyzing your Power BI workspaces,

1114
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,470
it would go through and
show all the details for you

1115
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,600
for complete transparency.

1116
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,310
And once you have all the details

1117
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,533
and the data is uploaded to S3,

1118
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,660
it would actually generate
a report in an Excel form,

1119
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,060
which actually is your complete analysis

1120
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,450
and inventory details
that is ready for use

1121
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,720
to do any ROI or TCU analysis.

1122
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,790
In this case, this is an example,

1123
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,000
a report where you can see
there are several tabs,

1124
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,420
and this particular tab shows
all the calculated fields

1125
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,370
that were used in your reports

1126
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,350
and the formulas that were used.

1127
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,510
So, you can easily translate that

1128
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,700
with the click of a button
when you're converting them

1129
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,890
over to the QuickSight.

1130
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,350
Next, it also shows those type of charts

1131
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,780
that are not natively
supported in QuickSight

1132
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,760
and automatically provides suggestion

1133
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,970
to the native supported
QuickSight chart types.

1134
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:09,360
And once those are configured,
and you're okay with it,

1135
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,930
you can actually continue
with the migration process

1136
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,730
of converting those dashboards.

1137
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,980
Lastly, it shows the confidence ratio

1138
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,090
of how much it actually
thinks it can actually

1139
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:24,630
convert it automatically
versus those case scenarios

1140
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:26,880
where it would require
some manual intervention

1141
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,310
that may need to be
looked at case by case.

1142
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,950
With that, there are,

1143
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,320
I'll try to wrap up with two quick things.

1144
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,810
First, with the help of AWS Transform

1145
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,070
and Wavicle's offering,

1146
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,500
you can unlock insights

1147
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,663
to your business intelligence platform,

1148
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,480
accelerate migration, and do
it faster, better, and cheaper.

1149
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,257
Lastly, we are available
at our expo at Booth 611,

1150
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,830
in case you have any questions

1151
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,890
or would like to have a demo,

1152
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,510
please feel free to reach out.

1153
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,240
We are also available on wavicledata.com

1154
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,740
should you have any questions.

1155
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,573
Thank you.

1156
00:58:05,573 --> 00:58:07,322
With that, I would re-invite Murtaza.

1157
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,636
- Thank you, Anantha.

1158
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:18,030
You saw how Wavicle Data Solutions is

1159
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,693
extending the migration
capabilities of AWS Transform,

1160
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,790
and we are also working
with other partners,

1161
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,593
here's what Accenture is doing,

1162
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,830
For mainframe modernization,

1163
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:36,660
where it typically targets
regulated industries

1164
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,953
like financial services,
or healthcare, or telcos.

1165
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,230
There are mainframes that were
built several decades ago,

1166
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:51,120
and while migrating and
modernizing those workloads,

1167
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,420
especially for the regulated segments,

1168
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,420
the practitioners
typically have to consult

1169
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,433
domain and industry experts.

1170
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,830
So, instead of having to
talk to an expert separately

1171
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,723
while performing migration,

1172
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:12,480
what Accenture is doing with
AWS Transform composability

1173
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,810
is that they're augmenting
the knowledge bases

1174
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,120
that are available in AWS Transform

1175
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,090
and making the chat even more powerful

1176
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,380
so that the practitioners,

1177
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,130
instead of going and talking to

1178
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:28,020
domain and industry experts separately,

1179
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,500
they can do it directly within
the AWS Transform interface

1180
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,483
via the chat experience.

1181
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,733
Additionally,

1182
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,200
they're also extending the components

1183
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,330
that are available in AWS Transform,

1184
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,580
like business rule extraction,

1185
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,480
and catering them to what
the industry specific

1186
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,773
migration needs have.

1187
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:57,243
Another partner who is
co-innovating with us is Capgemini.

1188
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,760
Capgemini is another use case

1189
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,453
for simplifying mainframe modernizations.

1190
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,830
One of the key aspects of
mainframe modernization is that

1191
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:13,710
many a times it requires understanding

1192
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,253
of what the current applications
and workloads are doing,

1193
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,920
extract the business rules,

1194
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,860
and then take a forward
engineering approach

1195
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,860
to create the application again,

1196
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,820
re-imagining it,

1197
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,490
keeping the business rules
and business logic intact

1198
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:33,090
and creating the entire
architecture in a modernized form.

1199
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,846
That's where Capgemini is leveraging

1200
01:00:34,846 --> 01:00:37,050
AWS Transform composability.

1201
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:42,810
Well, these were the design partners.

1202
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,310
We'd like to hear more.

1203
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,240
And if you want to build
with us on AWS Transform,

1204
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,480
you can reach out via your
partner development manager

1205
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,100
or partner SA,

1206
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:58,100
or tell us what you want to
build in Partner Central.

1207
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,083
The link is available
via the QR code here.

1208
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,890
Thank you so much for spending the time

1209
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,903
and attending this session.
