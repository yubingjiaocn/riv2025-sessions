1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,353
- Well, hi, everybody.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,030
Welcome to WPS208.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,120
This is Covered California with AWS

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,440
and today we're gonna talk a little bit

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,945
about the data-driven
customer retention strategies

6
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:16,390
that Covered California has put in place

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,283
to help with customer retention.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,360
Well, let me go ahead and go forward here.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,290
I'm Chris Carter.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,530
I am a senior sales specialist with AWS.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,000
I focus on Amazon Connect

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,670
for public sector accounts in the West,

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,294
and I'm joined today by Glenn and Kevin.

14
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,127
Would you like to introduce yourselves?

15
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:37,200
- Good afternoon. I'm Kevin Cornish.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,810
I'm the chief information
officer at Covered California.

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,210
I run our technology
that supports our mission

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,070
that we're gonna talk
about this afternoon.

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,237
- And hi, everyone. I'm Glenn Oyoung.

20
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm the chief marketing
officer at Covered California.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,353
You could probably tell

22
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:49,740
because I'm the one that took the selfie.

23
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,030
I wanna remember this.

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,470
How many times do you
get to talk to people

25
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,750
with a bunch of yellow headsets?

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,280
Thank you for joining us.
(Chris laughs)

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,113
- Excellent.

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,958
Okay, so real briefly, Glenn
will do a quick introduction

29
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,370
to Covered California.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,710
So for those that aren't
familiar with Covered California,

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,920
you'll learn a little
bit about who they are.

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,690
Some of the market forces and changes

33
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,830
that have happened recently

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,830
that are driving, I guess, concern maybe

35
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,060
amongst the residents and constituents

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,710
of the state of California

37
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,843
in obtaining health insurance.

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,770
Some different initiatives that
Covered California has taken

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,900
to drive better retention

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
or improve retention for their customers

41
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,030
and marketing outreach.

42
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,220
And then we'll wrap it up with Q&A.

43
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,080
Q&A is not gonna be live today,

44
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,340
so when we're done with the session,

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,740
you can just meet us, like, up
in the front or in the back,

46
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,203
and we can take live Q&A when we're done.

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,220
So with that, I'm gonna
hand it over to Glenn.

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,510
- Thanks so much, Chris.

49
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,890
- Yeah.
- Hi again.

50
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,630
And thank you so much for
taking time out of your day

51
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,700
to come learn a little bit
about Covered California,

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,590
what we do, and retention,

53
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,830
and ultimately how our technology partners

54
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,030
help us facilitate that.

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,590
So before we get into it,

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,570
if you're not familiar
with Covered California,

57
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,370
we are the state healthcare exchange

58
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,350
for the state of California.

59
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,183
Here on the slide,

60
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:17,760
you can see many of the plans
that we connect people to.

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,490
But we're not just Expedia
connecting people to plans.

62
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,140
We do much more than that.

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,340
But I just wanna level set.

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,590
And many states do have
healthcare exchanges,

65
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,180
and for those that don't,

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,853
they direct their folks to healthcare.gov.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
What is our mission?

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,020
Our mission, as you can
see, is really fourfold.

69
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,180
And so as I just alluded to,

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
we do connect people to plans.

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,580
That's core to our mission.

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,530
We want people to get covered.

73
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,480
That's in our name.

74
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,903
I paused like I just realized
that, but I've known that.

75
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,520
You know, and what does that really mean?

76
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,590
So it's our job, it's our mission

77
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,630
to give people affordable choices,

78
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,750
that those choices are
not just affordable,

79
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,540
but the plans and the coverage
that we connect people to

80
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,130
are high quality.

81
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,900
We care very deeply about health equity

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,970
and what that means is
closing the health equity gaps

83
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,680
that do exist in our country

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,180
and just really around the world.

85
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,810
And we have the great ability
to work with these plans

86
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,190
and work with the plans that we select

87
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,630
and work with every day

88
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,220
to try and make sure
that we're closing gaps

89
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,810
for the communities that we serve.

90
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,330
And speaking of service across the board,

91
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,100
whether it's marketing or IT

92
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,220
or our service center, you name it,

93
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,600
every part of Covered California,

94
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,330
we are committed to the mission,

95
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,540
truly and deeply ingrained in our hearts,

96
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,360
and that shows up in exceptional service.

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,210
I do want to pause and say
a quick story if I could,

98
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,723
which is on the very first
day of open enrollment,

99
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,240
at about 1:00 a.m.,

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,500
Kevin and I got a text from one
of our partners here, Brian,

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,180
who's, you can wave, it's okay,

102
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,083
silently wave,

103
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,260
telling us about the very first enrollment

104
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,643
in the state of California.

105
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,710
And, you know, emojis were shared.

106
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,450
And I say that to say that I know

107
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,600
that everyone on the stage and
the teams that we work with,

108
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
including the partners that
we choose to work with,

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,030
we choose to work with people
like Brian and his team

110
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,270
because that mission is paramount to us.

111
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,320
And I hear we have an hour,

112
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,430
so I'm gonna tell you another story

113
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,600
and it's gonna get a little more personal,

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,550
but I want you to think
about what that means

115
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,750
in the state of California.

116
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,610
My parents are immigrants.

117
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,770
They came to this country with nothing

118
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,420
in pursuit of the American dream.

119
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,880
My father was an engineer

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
and I think he would be very proud

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,780
that I get to stand in
front of STEM people

122
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,210
who are much smarter than
me in the realm of STEM

123
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,010
and talk about our mission.

124
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,320
My father unfortunately
passed away of cancer.

125
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,510
He worked his way up to be an engineer,

126
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,040
a successful engineer.

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,070
He could have picked any plan
he wanted when he retired.

128
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,590
He did not pick any of
the plans I showed you.

129
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,160
He picked a plan where most of
the providers speak Mandarin,

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
is a smaller plan,

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,910
and, ultimately, one of
the great traumatic things

132
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,743
in my life

133
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:02,920
is battling with his providers

134
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,100
and battling with his plan

135
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,870
and battling with anyone I could talk to

136
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,383
to make the last few weeks
of his life more comfortable.

137
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,240
So health equity is something I say a lot,

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,200
but for me personally,

139
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,360
that's what I think about when
I think about health equity.

140
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,310
I do think about my dad,

141
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,843
I do think about myself,

142
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,800
but I think about the people
unlike my dad or myself

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,040
who don't speak English,
didn't go to college,

144
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
didn't have a PhD,

145
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,650
don't have a son that can
even try to do that battle.

146
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,073
That is the complexity
of our healthcare system.

147
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,893
And I share that

148
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:45,150
because oftentimes, we
talk about these things.

149
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,550
Complexity, affordability, equity.

150
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,960
For me, it's very personal.

151
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
And I know that everyone
at Covered California

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
has some version of this story

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,673
that propels us to work as hard as we do.

154
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,550
So thank you for letting
me share that with you

155
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,410
because it's not about me or my dad,

156
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,330
it's about Californians,

157
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,040
it's about the people we serve.

158
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,600
That's what makes us work super hard

159
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,980
to try and do whatever
it is that we can do

160
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,720
to help our fellow Californians.

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,390
And I can tell you from talking
to people in other states

162
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,460
and state healthcare exchanges,

163
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,190
the feeling is very pervasive.

164
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,940
That's what we mean by our mission.

165
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,760
We've been really good at what we do.

166
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,580
One in six Californians have

167
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,160
or will have been a
Covered California member

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,993
in their lifetime,

169
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,150
whether they ever thought
they would be or not, right?

170
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,110
And one in three,

171
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,630
if you add in our partners at Medi-Cal,

172
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,870
have been served by Medi-Cal
or Covered California.

173
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,600
That's huge. Just think about that.

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,563
I will say that there are people

175
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,290
in this convention right now

176
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,563
who do not think they will
ever need Covered California,

177
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,100
but one in six of them might.

178
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,840
And it's our job to make sure,

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,570
especially in that type of environment

180
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,950
that they think, "I'll never need that,

181
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,200
so I don't really need to
connect with that brand,"

182
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,780
it's my job in marketing
and many of our peers

183
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,880
to make sure that, I hope that's true,

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,510
I hope you always have an
employee-sponsored insurance,

185
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,520
but if you don't, if you're laid off,

186
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,010
I hope the first thing you think about

187
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,260
is Covered California, right?

188
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,223
That's the job.

189
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,250
And we have been very successful

190
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,330
in reducing our uninsured
rate from 17% to 6%.

191
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,244
Meaning 94% of eligible Californians

192
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:32,220
prior to this moment in time

193
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,390
have found insurance

194
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,010
either through Covered
California or Medi-Cal

195
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,693
or their employer, right?

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,910
Last year I think we set a record

197
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,980
for almost two million enrolled,

198
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,440
which is very, very, we're proud of that.

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,890
And at the same time, this
year's a different year.

200
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,200
And so what do I mean by that?

201
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,540
Our government was shut
down, and I'll get into that,

202
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,770
but if you're tracking,

203
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,070
then you know that the subsidies
are planning to expire.

204
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,810
There's a lot of federal policy changes

205
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,720
and broader landscape changes
in healthcare in general

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,480
that have nothing to do with
decisions that we've made,

207
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,400
but make it even more complex

208
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,890
and more scary for Californians.

209
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,140
And so our answer to that,
starting from a year ago,

210
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,280
was really doubling down

211
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,370
on telling the story of
who we are from upper,

212
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,080
I'm a marketer, so go with me,

213
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,430
but upper funnel, right?

214
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,740
You guys know, building
awareness, building trust,

215
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,650
and working with partners
like Kevin and his team

216
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,510
and many of you in the front row

217
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,490
to take that trust and awareness

218
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,230
and turn that into action.

219
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,420
That's where technology
really comes into play.

220
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,800
And so I wanna show you a bit

221
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,590
before we get too deep
into the technology aspect

222
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,150
our new brand platform,

223
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,880
which is for the love of Californians.

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,310
And this is our
declaration, our first spot,

225
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,480
which is called Declaration

226
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,820
because it is indeed a declaration

227
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,324
of what our intent is here
at Covered California.

228
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:48,630
(bright music)

229
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,670
- [Announcer] We love California.

230
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,490
But we love Californians even more.

231
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,380
60 countries in one state

232
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,020
and the music of 200 languages.

233
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,520
At Covered California,

234
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,560
we believe every single Californian

235
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,750
deserves healthcare that works.

236
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,370
So let us haggle.

237
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,680
Let us cut through the confusion.

238
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,870
We are not a health insurance company.

239
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,380
We're in it for you, because we are you.

240
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,660
For the love of Californians.

241
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,043
Covered California.

242
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,300
- In other places I do this, people clap,

243
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,133
but I know we can't.

244
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,810
So just if you liked it, give me a sign.

245
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,643
Oh, you can clap.

246
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:26,940
Okay, we'll break some rules.

247
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,773
Thank you.

248
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:28,680
I wasn't asking for applause.

249
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,940
I just wanted you to know if it was done.

250
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,360
But, again, joking aside,
our brand platform,

251
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,010
our creative campaign, our tagline,

252
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,540
which you will see for many, many years,

253
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,090
I hope for many, maybe
even a decade, I hope,

254
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,370
is for the love of California, right?

255
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,200
That is gonna permeate everything we do

256
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,610
from an outreach perspective.

257
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,530
And it's great because although it's new,

258
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,363
it's not really new.

259
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,380
We have always loved Californians

260
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,580
and we're just saying it out loud

261
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,200
so people understand who we are

262
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,463
and why we do what we do.

263
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,490
So as we think about that,

264
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,930
we want to start showing you

265
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,120
beyond the big brand and the pivot

266
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,930
what does that love, how does
that show up in this moment

267
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,290
where we have to focus
on some other aspects

268
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,293
that we typically haven't
had to focus on before?

269
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,680
- Thank you, Glenn.

270
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,513
I'll clap for you.

271
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,780
- Oh, thank you. I'll clap for you.

272
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,840
- So at Covered California,

273
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,790
we're obsessed by three things.

274
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,623
The first is our mission.

275
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,860
Glenn talked a little
bit about our mission.

276
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,590
It's to make sure that
every California resident,

277
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,870
every resident of the great
state of California has access

278
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,730
to affordable, high-quality healthcare.

279
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,990
He talked about some numbers.

280
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,680
When Covered California came
online about a dozen years ago,

281
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,990
more than 17% of our state's population

282
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,790
had no access to insurance.

283
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,680
That means when their
kid got the sniffles,

284
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,970
they ran to the ER, right?

285
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,500
That means that they were using

286
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,050
very expensive healthcare options

287
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,760
in pretty inconvenient ways.

288
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,740
And they were putting themselves
and their families at risk

289
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,800
for immense financial catastrophes, right?

290
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,060
Any health scare

291
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,530
could take their car off
the road, essentially,

292
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,180
their family's car off the road.

293
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,530
So that number one is
affinity for our mission.

294
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,657
Number two, our number two obsession

295
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:04,800
is consumers' experience.

296
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,780
And so we're a state agency.

297
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,450
We're an agency of the
state of California, right?

298
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,070
When I came to Covered California,

299
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,470
I was a little bit
intrigued by people saying

300
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,620
that the consumer experience
is our North Star.

301
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,660
It's something we're really,
really obsessive about.

302
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,450
I'm like, "The government
doesn't care about me.

303
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,630
They care about me when
they want my taxes, right?

304
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,000
They care about me when I
have to pay a traffic ticket.

305
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,560
But otherwise they don't
care about me too much."

306
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
Covered California really cares

307
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,803
about our consumers and our citizens.

308
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,440
And so that's that customer obsession.

309
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,510
We're gonna talk a little bit
about the consumer journey

310
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,850
and how some of the technology
we've deployed recently

311
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,040
has really improved that consumer journey

312
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,990
and the customer's experience.

313
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,280
We'll talk a little bit about friction,

314
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,830
which is the enemy of a
consumer's experience,

315
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,530
and what we do to reduce friction.

316
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,090
The third thing we're obsessed with

317
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,493
is information security and privacy.

318
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,280
Glenn talked about one in six Californians

319
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,870
have been through Covered California.

320
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,130
We are also the front door,

321
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,200
our platform CalHEERS is the front door

322
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,390
for eligibility determination

323
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,890
for the Medicaid system in California,

324
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,210
which is called Medi-Cal.

325
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,210
So every year, about 17 million
members of our population,

326
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,960
you know, that's close to half,

327
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,670
39 million people in California,

328
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,030
come through our system and
either go to a Medi-Cal solution

329
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,800
or come to Covered California.

330
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,080
That means over time we've collected PII

331
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,040
and some other forms of health information

332
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,020
on nearly 25 million Californians.

333
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,590
So we're obsessed about
information privacy and security.

334
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,920
We want to safeguard
those consumers' data.

335
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,690
So I'm gonna talk a little
bit about a challenge

336
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,940
that we faced in the last couple years

337
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,190
that we recognized in
that consumer journey.

338
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,980
Remember, for the consumer
journey, friction is a bad thing.

339
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,813
We don't want it.

340
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:47,010
We want to push people through a workflow

341
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,350
that gets them to a conclusion,

342
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,390
which is they're enrolled
in a health plan,

343
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,270
as easy and smoothly
and quickly as possible.

344
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,830
So we found that the way

345
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,720
we were doing eligibility determination

346
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,740
on this platform called CalHEERS

347
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:05,580
was giving anxiety to about
33% of our population.

348
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,330
They were literally exiting
the workflow at that point.

349
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,680
We did a little bit of digging

350
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,850
and started to determine

351
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,450
that this eligibility
determination process we used,

352
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,700
which was relying on credit checking,

353
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,430
was not something that our
demographic liked, right?

354
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,130
A large number of 'em don't
have great credit scores

355
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,380
or maybe even credit scores at all.

356
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,000
Also, a large number of
'em just don't wanna share

357
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,380
that kind of information
with the government

358
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,390
or even have that conversation, right?

359
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,850
And so we found that a
third of our consumers

360
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,410
would exit the workflow.

361
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,890
They would come to our solution,
our self-serve platform.

362
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,510
They would do an eligibility determination

363
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,180
and determine they were eligible
for some form of subsidy,

364
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,060
which would reduce the cost
of that insurance plan.

365
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,850
They would begin to do
some what we call shopping

366
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,470
and comparing health plan options

367
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,120
between some of the health plans

368
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,550
that you saw on the slide
that Glenn showed before.

369
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,200
And then when it came
time for us to determine

370
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,580
you are really who you say you are

371
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,820
so we know that that eligibility
determination is valid,

372
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,410
we would go to this credit check process

373
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,690
and they'd say, "Ugh, I want outta here.

374
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,040
I don't like this. I'm uncomfortable.

375
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,270
I leave."

376
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,060
And for the most part, we never
saw those consumers again.

377
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,850
So a third of our population was leaving

378
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,320
before we scored a goal, right?

379
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,820
We were not able to satisfy
our mission with them.

380
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,110
So we began to look in the
marketplace for a solution.

381
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,770
And we've been on the Amazon
cloud for about four years.

382
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,954
We've had a great journey
from an on-prem solution

383
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,480
when I joined the company five years ago

384
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,950
to a highly-tuned
microservices-based, cloud-native,

385
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,550
taking advantage of cloud platform.

386
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,500
And so we initially started to look at,

387
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,820
well, what other solutions are out there

388
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,000
that would plug into this AWS ecosystem?

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,440
And how could we take advantage of someone

390
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,720
who we would trust because
they're in our system?

391
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,450
Remember that third obsession
with privacy and security

392
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,070
that we really need to make sure

393
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,950
that this was, you know,
very sensitive information

394
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,795
and a sensitive workflow.

395
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,070
Who could do that?

396
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,220
So we found a solution from Socure,

397
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,220
which does not use the concept
of a credit-based risk score,

398
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,120
and we began to prototype it.

399
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,350
It solved two problems for us.

400
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,520
One was what I talked about,

401
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,810
that exit ramp where 33% of
our clients were just leaving

402
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,370
and never coming back.

403
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,580
The other one was there's
a lot of focus lately,

404
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,010
both inside our industry and
from the federal government,

405
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,840
on fraud, waste, and abuse.

406
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,340
And so we were also looking for a solution

407
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,020
that would solve some of the potential

408
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,120
fraud, waste, and abuse issues

409
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,060
that we may have been
experiencing in our system

410
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,800
and maybe not even known about it.

411
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,073
So we picked Socure and we did a deploy.

412
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,440
Talk a little bit about some
of the things that this did.

413
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,163
So a very different approach
to validating consumers.

414
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,100
The long story short
here is we were able to,

415
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm just gonna jump to the next screen

416
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,740
'cause I like the stats here,

417
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,970
we were able to,

418
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,740
on the left side, from
a consumer experience,

419
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,373
we moved to a seamless
deploy in our system.

420
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,753
Worked with our solution,
again, called CalHEERS.

421
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:07,294
No noticeable difference
for the consumers.

422
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,550
We had some very effective

423
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,190
fraud deterrence components of this.

424
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,680
So some of the statistics
you'll see up on the right,

425
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,270
we initially, right off the bat,

426
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,490
found about 5% of the transactions

427
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,500
that were coming into the
system were fraudulent

428
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,770
and the system was able to
identify those consumers

429
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,470
and take them out of the workflow.

430
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,460
We also did, the next
thing was the passive flow

431
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,350
of consumers through our solution.

432
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,460
We are today operating

433
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,430
about 85% of our consumers
passively go through,

434
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,080
meaning they don't have to do anything.

435
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,610
We know enough about their biometrics,

436
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,740
about their background

437
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,770
and information from
the Socure secret sauce

438
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,880
that we are validating them

439
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,400
without any more action on their behalf.

440
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,550
About 15% of our
consumers don't pass that.

441
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,440
And we go to another form of validation

442
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
and Chris will talk,

443
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,290
he'll walk us through a little
bit of that in a moment.

444
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,460
But essentially in the end,

445
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,040
98% of the consumers are getting through

446
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,150
this really critical step.

447
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,120
We're being able to
validate their identity.

448
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,340
We're limiting the fraudsters,

449
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,440
that roughly 5% of the
folks who are coming in

450
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,770
trying to do something that was not right.

451
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,850
And if you recall,

452
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,860
that problem we had
initially that got us here,

453
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,920
33% of our consumers leaving
and never coming back,

454
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,020
never getting to an insurance plan,

455
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,853
that's gone.

456
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,410
We are passing 98% of them through.

457
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,243
They're down the highway.

458
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,840
They're going through the
shop and compare step.

459
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,250
They're finding one of those health plans

460
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,050
that is affordable for their family.

461
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,180
They're making sure they're
getting the maximum subsidy,

462
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,670
which is reducing the cost
of that plan for them.

463
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,710
And they're signing up
for health insurance.

464
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,390
And that's really important to us, right?

465
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,780
We are still concerned
that 6% of Californians

466
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,990
who probably have access
to a solution through us

467
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,100
are not taking advantage of it.

468
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,660
So this is a way of getting us

469
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,030
back focused on that consumer experience.

470
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,540
How do we make sure that we
get more Californians insured

471
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,150
that we get to that basic human right,

472
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,820
which is I have a human
right to be healthy.

473
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,653
I have a human right

474
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,400
to access this amazing healthcare system

475
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,570
in the United States

476
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,090
and not be worried about
some catastrophic impact

477
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,160
on my family's finances.

478
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,660
It's really, really important to us,

479
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,443
going back to our first
obsession, which is our mission.

480
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:15,540
So I think I'm gonna give it to Chris.

481
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,760
Chris is gonna talk a
little bit about that step

482
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,060
where the passive verification
doesn't work, right?

483
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,460
The 15% that have to go to some next step.

484
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,560
He's gonna walk us through how that works.

485
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,910
- Great. Thank you, Kevin.

486
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,750
All right, so as Kevin mentioned,

487
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,130
about 84% of the people
that go through the system

488
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,890
will go through what's
called passive verification.

489
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,790
And with passive verification,
the users will input,

490
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,820
you know, personally
identifiable information.

491
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,080
So, name, address, other information.

492
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,610
And through a process
that Socure provides,

493
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,330
they'll do device analytics

494
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:58,380
and a number of other things

495
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,530
and basically process all of
that information passively

496
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,280
to make a determination of
that person's identity or not.

497
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,980
And again, 84% of the people
will pass through that

498
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,330
not knowing that they've ever even

499
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,250
gone through this process.

500
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,440
So it's great right off the bat.

501
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,730
But for the 16% that don't
make it through that process,

502
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,270
then they go to what's called
DocV or document verification.

503
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,240
And Socure provides this mobile platform

504
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,950
or this type of experience

505
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,950
where you can provide a
government-issued ID and biometrics,

506
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,120
in this case, a picture,

507
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,910
and Socure will use that

508
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,840
to basically provide a
additional mechanism now

509
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,230
to validate that that person
is who they say they are.

510
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,690
So with, like, the
photo that you see here,

511
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,040
it's comparing that photo and liveliness,

512
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,990
you know, things like make
sure your eyes are open

513
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,700
or look to the left, look to the right.

514
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,501
They're even checking things
like is their shoulder up?

515
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,720
You know, 'cause your shoulder would be up

516
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,900
if you're holding a phone in
front of you to take a picture.

517
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,210
Like, little things like that.

518
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,830
So it's checking, you know, liveliness,

519
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,940
it's checking your document

520
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,725
and using AWS services,

521
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,050
which I'll talk about on the next slide,

522
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,280
but to extract all of the information

523
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:14,520
off of those documents

524
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,370
and compare that to
the passive information

525
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,200
that was collected previously.

526
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,970
And again, as Kevin mentioned,

527
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,780
the vast, vast majority of
people between these two methods

528
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,330
are now able to get through this process

529
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,083
and not fall out of the
system like they were before.

530
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,610
A little bit of an eye chart,

531
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,510
but this is kind of what
it looks like in practice.

532
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,230
Off to the right-hand side of
the slide are the AWS services

533
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,690
that Socure is using.

534
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,530
It's a advanced machine learning model.

535
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,090
A lot of proprietary stuff

536
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,920
that they're using behind the scenes

537
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,870
to provide their service.

538
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,690
But some of the services from AWS

539
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,520
that they're using to
form the basis of that

540
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,595
are Amazon Textract.

541
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,240
Textract is the service that is used

542
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,760
to pull the information
off of the documents,

543
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,370
so pull texts off of the IDs

544
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,930
or off other documents that
could be basically scanned.

545
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,030
They're using Amazon Rekognition

546
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,690
for the photo recognition part
and the liveliness detection.

547
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,677
So again, you can say things like,

548
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:21,600
"Turn your head to the right

549
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,680
or turn your head to the left

550
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,120
and open your mouth."

551
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,260
Like, you can do things like that

552
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,830
to detect that you're actually
looking at a live person

553
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,480
and not a picture of a person

554
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,523
that might be on an ID.

555
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,240
They're using services like SageMaker

556
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,970
to help develop their ML models.

557
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,180
Again, it's their service
that they're providing,

558
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,300
but they're able to build
quickly using SageMaker

559
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,800
and, you know, adapt and
continue to develop the service

560
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,913
and make improvements.

561
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,430
Amazon Pinpoint for messaging.

562
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,370
So their SMS and email,

563
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,070
this is moving to end user messaging.

564
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,450
So if you haven't heard,

565
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,420
Amazon Pinpoint is moving
toward end user messaging.

566
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,340
They're moving to that as well.

567
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,050
But the basis of Socure is
based on Amazon Pinpoint.

568
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,610
And then as Kevin mentioned before,

569
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,160
all of this is basically co-located

570
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,660
in the same region within AWS
as the CalHEERS app itself.

571
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,950
So it's a very low latency, secure,

572
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,280
and allows access or
allows the two systems

573
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,810
to interact together

574
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,730
in I guess a very efficient manner

575
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,663
and secure manner.

576
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,363
So with that, we'll move on
to case study number two.

577
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:41,867
- I think that's me.
- Yep, Glenn.

578
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,193
- All right. Thanks so much.

579
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,720
Great. So thanks again.

580
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,240
We're gonna now turn our attention
to our second case study.

581
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,940
And you've heard me mention retention.

582
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,350
That's not necessarily something

583
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,260
that we've ever been
really focused on that much

584
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,093
at Covered California.

585
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,150
It's always been a part,

586
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,290
and I think if you were to step back

587
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,180
and say each division, each department

588
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,120
is doing something retention related,

589
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,100
but really if you think
about Covered California

590
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,350
and state healthcare exchanges,

591
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,220
we are a transitory experience
for most of our members.

592
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,280
Meaning our average
tenure's 14 months, right?

593
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,180
Prior to Covered California,

594
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,830
I worked for one of those health plans.

595
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,000
The average tenure ideally

596
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,133
is as long as humanly possible, right?

597
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,700
So for us, we're meant to
be here in a moment in time

598
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,320
for most people where they need us.

599
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,330
And then again, ideally, in this country,

600
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,380
the ideal path forward is
employee-sponsored healthcare.

601
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,820
You get it from Deloitte,

602
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,810
you get it from Amazon,

603
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,860
you get it from your employer,

604
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,110
or you start your own business
or something like that.

605
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,513
So we haven't really had to focus on that.

606
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,790
That wasn't really core, right?

607
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,830
But we do need to focus on that very much

608
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,010
for all the reasons that
I'm about to get into.

609
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,760
And so that created
another level of urgency

610
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,320
for us across the organization

611
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,626
to really think about,
what is our approach

612
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,430
and strategy to retention?

613
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,990
Why does it matter?

614
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,490
It matters because we don't want people

615
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,630
to go uninsured, right?

616
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,130
And then how does technology

617
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,800
and how does working together
help us achieve that?

618
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,510
So I've mentioned a couple headwinds.

619
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,107
I'm just gonna lightly touch on it.

620
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:10,650
But it's clear from our focus groups,

621
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,150
it's clear from whether you talk

622
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,660
about federal, state,
city, it doesn't matter.

623
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,210
I'm in the trust business,
we're in the trust business.

624
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,279
If you don't trust Covered California,

625
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,112
if you read the news

626
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:25,650
and it makes you want
to close down your app,

627
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,690
it's very hard for us to
talk to you about healthcare

628
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,680
or really anything.

629
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,470
And we see that in not only our research,

630
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,140
but very widely published research.

631
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,570
And it's been that way
before even this year, right?

632
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,060
This healthcare system in general,

633
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,590
because of the complexity,

634
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,940
because of surprise bills,

635
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,590
because of access problems

636
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,660
even dating back to the pandemic,

637
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,173
trust has really been a struggle
for everyone in this space.

638
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,919
And then specific to Covered California,

639
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,520
we've typically enjoyed
very high brand awareness,

640
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,450
but when you double-click

641
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,210
into beyond have you heard
of Covered California,

642
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,130
what do you know about Covered California,

643
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,890
what do you feel about Covered California,

644
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,380
the trend has been going down,

645
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,960
and again, that's even
before what's happening now

646
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,510
with our government's sort of stalemate

647
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,000
around federal tax subsidies.

648
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,730
So as a marketer, this is job security.

649
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,563
No, I'm just kidding.

650
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:21,150
As a marketer, this is the call to action.

651
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,770
And this is the need,

652
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,300
the urgent need for us to do something

653
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,240
to make sure that people take the time

654
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,740
to take notice of who we are

655
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,290
so that we then have the
right to pull alongside them

656
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,240
and tell them all the ways that
we can support them, right?

657
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,110
And so I've mentioned this a couple times,

658
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,840
but, you know, without
getting super jargony,

659
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,830
there are tax subsidies,
federal subsidies,

660
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,710
that are set to expire
at the end of this year

661
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,080
and the end of this year
is quickly approaching.

662
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,220
And even today,

663
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,490
depending on what day you
open up your news apps,

664
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,080
are they gonna get extended?

665
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,490
Are they not gonna get extended?

666
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,900
Are they extended for two years?

667
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,730
Should we even have the ACA?

668
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,610
This is the confusion that
I'm talking about, right?

669
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,600
And the end result in human context

670
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,330
is it creates a wave of emotions

671
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,250
that ultimately, for consumers, means

672
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,660
that many of them will
delay any kind of action

673
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,250
and many of them will
say, "It's too confusing,

674
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,170
I'm just gonna wait this out."

675
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,120
And again, the danger will be

676
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,130
that that 6% unemployed skyrockets

677
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,450
and our own internal
projections, you know, say

678
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,760
that potentially if
these subsidies expire,

679
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,290
something like a third of our members

680
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,280
will unfortunately make that
tough choice to not renew.

681
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,830
And it wouldn't be because
they don't know the value.

682
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,810
It wouldn't be because
they haven't had access

683
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,640
to high-quality, affordable plans.

684
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,600
For many of them,

685
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,630
it comes down to their health
insurance bills doubling

686
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,240
and having to make the choice
between paying for food,

687
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,710
literally, I'll say it again,

688
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,000
paying for food, paying
for gas to get to work,

689
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,920
paying for rent,

690
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,220
or this idea of healthcare insurance.

691
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,680
And something that I believe
after many years of marketing

692
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,500
is most humans are bad at managing risk.

693
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,460
Look at my haircut.

694
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,900
That's a great example.

695
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,180
Don't look from the back, right?

696
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,180
So when you layer that
on with this complexity,

697
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,480
again, that goes to this moment in time

698
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,250
where all of us at Covered California

699
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,850
really have to meet this moment.

700
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,010
I summarized the headwinds.

701
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,380
I would just say that
we did 21 focus groups

702
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,670
across the state.

703
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,010
So this is not just an opinion.

704
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,870
This is hearing from real people

705
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,030
who really are struggling
with this moment.

706
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,670
And healthcare is just one
part of their lives, right?

707
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,720
I mentioned the other areas

708
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,470
that we all have seen the
effects of inflation and so on.

709
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,630
And so really, again, the strategic shift

710
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,150
to a focus on retention
was really paramount.

711
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,920
And luckily for us as a team,

712
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,640
we've been thinking about
this for at least a year

713
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,920
and we've been working as a team

714
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,900
before this month for a year

715
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,250
to figure out what we can do

716
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,800
and then, again, stand up some things

717
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,030
to lean in and help.

718
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,530
And so what are those things, right?

719
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,620
Ultimately, I would just point
your attention to the bottom,

720
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,890
through all the wonders of
technology and our partnerships

721
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,630
and our wonderful team,

722
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,520
many of whom are sitting right here,

723
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,530
we are mining our own data

724
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,320
to ultimately understand our customers

725
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,290
and to profile the risk of leaving, right?

726
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,050
So a retention model, a risk profiling,

727
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,330
that then feeds into segmentation

728
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,693
and then, on the left, creates
more personalized messages,

729
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,740
more personalized, more nuanced messages.

730
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,890
And I'm smiling because
with my own marketing team,

731
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,930
I think we all know,

732
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,920
I will say, "Well, what do we
expect from Amazon," right?

733
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,350
Not AWS, but Amazon, right?

734
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,160
And what is that customer
experience expectation

735
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,280
that we have in for-profit brands,

736
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,020
in buying a car, in buying shoes,

737
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,520
in buying an airplane ticket?

738
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,650
Those are the same fluid expectations

739
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,600
that transfer to us, right?

740
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,100
It shouldn't be this hard.

741
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,140
People do expect us to know them

742
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,990
and to manifest that knowledge
into personalized outreach,

743
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,340
which we historically haven't done

744
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,980
as much as we could have, but we are now.

745
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,510
And then how does that show up

746
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,550
when you're talking to our agents

747
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,870
and how prepared are our
agents to also treat you

748
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,660
in a way that's more
tailored to your situation?

749
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,370
This is really the unlock

750
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,190
that this work with technology

751
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,163
and with AWS and our
partners have done for us.

752
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,213
I'm gonna hand it over to do
the triple-click into that.

753
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,100
- Yeah. Thank you, Glenn.

754
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,330
- Thanks.

755
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,670
- All right, so how does that work, right?

756
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,930
Or what does that look like,

757
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,220
these personalized messages,

758
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,611
and how do you develop those?

759
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:48,611
So the team at Deloitte,
along with Covered California,

760
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,520
started working backwards
from previous data,

761
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,714
from previous enrollees.

762
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:58,650
They built what's considered

763
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,620
or we'll call it a risk score.

764
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,120
And a risk score is really
just the modeled probability

765
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,170
that a member is going to renew or not,

766
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,693
and a number of factors
go into that risk score.

767
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,490
Things like a premium increase

768
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,760
or the way that they earn
income, you know, today.

769
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
Like, do they have a large salary

770
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,690
or are they a gig worker?

771
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,216
Their age.

772
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:30,480
You know, like, are they a young
person, maybe very healthy,

773
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,313
or are they older?

774
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:33,030
Are they taking care of dependents

775
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,220
or are they just taking
care of themselves?

776
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,410
So there's a lot of
factors that go into this.

777
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,120
And when you look at past data,

778
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,250
you can see how premium increases

779
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,910
might have impacted
certain audience segments

780
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,100
and you can make predictions
in the future then

781
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,870
about how these changes that
Glenn outlined a second ago

782
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,860
might impact the members in 2026.

783
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,060
So using R on Snowflake,

784
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,380
the Deloitte team modeled at scale

785
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,600
across hundreds of thousands,

786
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,380
millions even really, people

787
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,484
to develop risk scores and
created audience segments.

788
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:17,940
And I'm just gonna scroll
down here a little bit

789
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,590
in my notes.

790
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,390
So one example of an audience segment

791
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,670
is, let's say, a young
adult, age 26 to 35.

792
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,523
They live in a urban California city.

793
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,180
They're like a gig worker
or an hourly worker,

794
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,400
and their primary concern

795
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,740
is going to be the cost of insurance.

796
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,790
A 10 to $20 increase in monthly,

797
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,180
whoops, I don't know
what just happened there,

798
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,850
a 10 to $20 month increase,

799
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,600
a 10 to $20 per month increase
would really impact them.

800
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,760
And so they're primarily concerned

801
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,040
about what that cost is.

802
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,313
Another person, I don't
know what happened there,

803
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,110
I'll just go back on here.

804
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:07,530
Okay (chuckles).

805
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:12,150
Another audience segment
might be an older couple,

806
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:17,150
let's say 45 to 55, supporting dependents.

807
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,810
They might have maybe chronic
health issues in the family.

808
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,310
They're obviously going to be concerned

809
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,930
about price increases,

810
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,640
but for them, the most important thing

811
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,940
is to have continued insurance, right?

812
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,710
That's the most important thing.

813
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,347
I think all of us in here have realized,

814
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:36,390
you know, that you don't
really care about your health

815
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,890
until it goes bad.

816
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,537
You wake up one day and your back's out

817
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:41,637
and all of a sudden health matters, right?

818
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,950
They're already experiencing that.

819
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,860
So health insurance is
very important to them.

820
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,370
So with this, the team developed

821
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,050
these five audience segments

822
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,760
initially based primarily

823
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,450
on what the impact of
premium increases will have

824
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,750
on each of these different
audience segments

825
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,983
that were modeled.

826
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,873
Then from that, based
on these risk segments,

827
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,030
then using AI,

828
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,730
created a number of customized messages.

829
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,870
And when I say a number,

830
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,080
I mean thousands of customized messages,

831
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,080
SMS messages, email messages,

832
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,670
messages that are targeted

833
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,830
to those different audience segments.

834
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,190
And again, using AI, specifically LLMs,

835
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,270
we're able to basically run simulations,

836
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,430
again, hundreds of
thousands of simulations

837
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,870
using these messages

838
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,850
against these audience segments.

839
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,060
And they could look at
things like click rates

840
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,320
or open rates,

841
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,450
like, model these in simulation

842
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,450
rather than testing
these on actual people.

843
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,920
The power of the cloud here

844
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,140
is that you can run these simulations

845
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,190
at massive, massive scale in
very short periods of time

846
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,740
at extreme low cost.

847
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,680
And with it, ultimately
what you get out of it

848
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,680
are the perfect message for each channel,

849
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,390
like SMS or email,

850
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,250
for each audience segment.

851
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,190
The ones that that person
is going to open and click

852
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,860
and is going to resonate with the best.

853
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,693
To Glenn's point,

854
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,920
you want that kind of Amazon experience.

855
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,620
You want the company to know you.

856
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,203
This is that more personalized experience.

857
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,030
And then I'll turn it back over to Glenn

858
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,250
for what that actually
looked like in practice.

859
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,510
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

860
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,360
- Yeah, so what I'm gonna show you now,

861
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,130
we started with an ad,
again, hyper personal,

862
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,140
now we're talking about
member communications

863
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,140
and this is when we,

864
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,620
oh, you can't hear me?

865
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,090
Yeah. Okay.

866
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:45,923
High five? Bad?

867
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:46,756
Okay.

868
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,453
That was a real-time NPS score.

869
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,470
You know, I showed you the ad

870
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,210
and here we are talking about retention

871
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,040
and member communications.

872
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,470
On the left is information we sent out

873
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,880
starting from July actually,

874
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,830
July all the way through September,

875
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,840
to let people know,

876
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,880
I would draw your attention
to the chart on the bottom,

877
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,220
this is personalized to each household,

878
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,920
what is this EPTC thing, right?

879
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,140
We know that people don't
need to know those acronyms,

880
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,000
but we wanted to help
people to understand,

881
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,590
in the case of this example,

882
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,900
you're getting a total of $500 worth

883
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,480
of subsidy or assistance

884
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,140
between these two
different sources of help

885
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,390
and this is set to expire in December.

886
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,373
We started sending that out in July,

887
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,250
you know, pretty early on.

888
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,260
And in comparing notes with our colleagues

889
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,460
across the nation,

890
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,170
you know, we were all trying
to figure out what to do

891
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,430
to get people's attention

892
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,440
and to really start to plant that seed.

893
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,810
And then I would draw your
attention to the right,

894
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,590
which is enabled by what
Chris just described,

895
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,660
this email goes longer and longer,

896
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,930
but it's basically very tailored

897
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,180
to each household, each segment,

898
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,380
and what they need to see

899
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,000
in terms of even their choices

900
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
of switching from different metal tiers,

901
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,920
gold, platinum, bronze, so on,

902
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,140
or even looking at different plans.

903
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,970
That sounds pretty par for the course.

904
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,610
I don't expect you guys
to do the wave for me.

905
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,340
Maybe outside I can induce you to do that.

906
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,990
But I can tell you for Covered California

907
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,790
and for our peers across the nation,

908
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,060
this is big, right?

909
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,770
It's us really, again, leaning hard

910
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,270
into what is the customer experience

911
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,970
that today's modern
consumer expects from us,

912
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,090
but that, frankly, large
government organizations

913
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,580
often find hard to do, right?

914
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,560
It is hard to do for a lot of reasons,

915
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,360
but because of all the technology

916
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,530
and investment of time,

917
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,000
we're able to do that.

918
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,440
And what I would say is
that, am I doing this one?

919
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,629
Okay, okay, here we go.
- Sure, yeah, thanks.

920
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:45,270
Okay, so that was the outreach.

921
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,000
So now we've reached the people.

922
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,210
Now they might have interest,
they might have questions,

923
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,460
so they might call, you
know, they call back in.

924
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,230
And when they reach the contact center,

925
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,920
we wanted that personalized
experience to continue.

926
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,920
So in a similar manner as
for the outbound campaign,

927
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,830
now we're looking at providing
that customized experience

928
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,663
for the customer

929
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:10,800
as they're coming back in.

930
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,300
So a set of custom messages,

931
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,740
when a person calls in,

932
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,920
they're gonna basically be
connected to a contact center.

933
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,800
In this case, it's Amazon
Connect for Covered California.

934
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
When they connect to Amazon Connect,

935
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,803
using text-to-speech,

936
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,490
or basically, let me back up,

937
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,190
we're doing a dynamic lookup in Salesforce

938
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,680
to find that customer profile information

939
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,210
and find that audience segment

940
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,700
and that risk score that
they're basically assigned to

941
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,300
and then dynamically going into DynamoDB

942
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,040
to look up and find a customized message

943
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,170
for that audience, you know,
segment, for that person.

944
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,510
Then using text-to-speech
and Amazon Connect,

945
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,160
we're able to play that message.

946
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,313
So it's customized to them.

947
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,870
At some point, they're gonna
get transferred to an agent.

948
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,400
And when they get transferred to an agent,

949
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,470
the agent is also going to get played

950
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,540
a customized whisper message

951
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,940
letting them know who this customer is

952
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,890
and their potential risk.

953
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,839
So now that agent is going
to provide customized

954
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,310
or personalized, I should say, support

955
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,310
for that particular
caller when they call in.

956
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,050
In addition, the Deloitte team developed

957
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:23,160
a customer retention
workspace for the enrollers

958
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,760
so that they have,
like, a set of high-risk

959
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,760
or at-risk customers that
they can reach out to.

960
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:33,690
And the ability, once
they reach out to them,

961
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,080
to then re-score or
basically disposition them,

962
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,790
like, "Okay, we reached out, they renewed.

963
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,560
We reached out, they're switching plans.

964
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,090
We reached out, they declined."

965
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,280
So now gathering a lot of data,

966
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,880
and then that in turn fed
into dashboards at the end

967
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,940
that, you know, now they have
just a lot more information

968
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,180
about how effective that
these campaigns are.

969
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,930
So, again, you're receiving
customized messages.

970
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,010
Now when you're calling in,

971
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,320
you're getting customized messages,

972
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,120
and the agents that are supporting you

973
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,260
are supporting you with,

974
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,903
they know who you are and
how to support you best.

975
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,880
And the best part,

976
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,970
maybe the best slide in
this whole slide deck,

977
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,980
is the impact that this created.

978
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,813
- Thanks, Chris.

979
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:15,840
I tried to steal his slide

980
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,580
'cause if you spend
enough time with IT guys,

981
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,840
you wanna become one.

982
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,240
So I was trying to steal your slide.

983
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,010
But, you know, from a results perspective,

984
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,560
you know, what it really
ends up being about

985
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,080
is what does it do, right?

986
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,540
It's not personalization
for the sake of it.

987
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,850
It's not all this work just
because we think it's right

988
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,680
or we think it's gonna pay off.

989
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,190
And what we're sharing
here is on the top part,

990
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,320
these are, immediately
following the campaign,

991
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
literally the next day
after the campaign launched,

992
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,680
and again, this is multimodal,

993
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,660
so you have email, you have SMS,

994
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,970
you have other things going off,

995
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,710
we had 5x the phone calls

996
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,603
that we normally would on that day.

997
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,340
We had 125% more traffic to our website

998
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,400
and we had 40% increase in logins.

999
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,280
And we can deduce that
those people were looking

1000
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,330
at the plans that we sent

1001
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,000
that personalized information to, right?

1002
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,640
That's just the first
day after this was sent.

1003
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,010
And then when we look
at the first two weeks

1004
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,420
after that campaign,

1005
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,650
it's basically a 3x improvement
in terms of retention.

1006
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,290
Again, the goal is retention, right?

1007
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,780
So for people who
experience the personalized,

1008
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,750
the aggregate effort of
being more segmented,

1009
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,980
being more personalized,

1010
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,240
we can see the payoff here.

1011
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,500
And we're very hopeful

1012
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,310
that in spite of the price
and affordability challenges,

1013
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,010
this is what the approach
is that we're gonna do

1014
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,030
because we're not gonna give up

1015
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,370
on any single Californian, right?

1016
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,400
The hard math of it is
that we can only do so much

1017
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,650
and at some point there
will be, for some segments,

1018
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,670
a very tough choice,

1019
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,110
which I've said multiple times,

1020
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,440
and we don't pretend that
any amount of personalization

1021
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,360
is going to get them
over that tough choice

1022
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,040
because it becomes Maslow's hierarchy,

1023
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,920
it becomes prioritization
for them and their life.

1024
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,970
But at the same time, who would
we be if we give up on this?

1025
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,420
We're going to continue to do
everything we know how to do

1026
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,750
and everything that you can
all in the audience help us do

1027
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,960
to fight to keep people covered.

1028
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,310
And if we can't get them covered,

1029
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,220
to fight to help them understand
that we care about them,

1030
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,540
they should pick up the phone

1031
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,130
and we can walk through whatever options

1032
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,390
they want to explore with us.

1033
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,310
And so these results are,

1034
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,960
you know, they're not
just sort of a vanity

1035
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,010
set of numbers for us.

1036
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,590
They're proof that we're
on the right path here

1037
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,273
in terms of our approach.

1038
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,450
I'm gonna do this slide
'cause I feel like I can.

1039
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,579
No, I'm just kidding.

1040
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,079
(all chuckle)

1041
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,510
- Okay, so we'll talk,

1042
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,750
I've already briefly talked
about how this works,

1043
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,904
but we'll walk through it again.

1044
00:41:41,904 --> 00:41:45,720
So based on the risk scores
and the audience segments,

1045
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,380
basically an encrypted
CSV file was developed

1046
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,760
and built by the Deloitte team

1047
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,620
and loaded into Salesforce.

1048
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,512
So now Salesforce has a
mapping of the customers

1049
00:41:57,512 --> 00:42:00,330
to their risk or to
their audience segment.

1050
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,320
When a customer calls
in to Amazon Connect,

1051
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,230
right here in the middle,

1052
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,510
there is a lookup that's
done through Lambda

1053
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,217
back to Salesforce

1054
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:14,610
to find out what is that
customer's risk score,

1055
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,050
what is our audience segment?

1056
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,290
And then from that, a lookup to DynamoDB

1057
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,850
to get the specific message

1058
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,060
that's going to be
played in Amazon Connect,

1059
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,883
again, using the built in
text-to-speech function.

1060
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,020
Correct me if I'm wrong,
English and Spanish, correct?

1061
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,240
Yeah, okay, English and Spanish.

1062
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,610
So that message is then played back

1063
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,830
to the consumer while they're,

1064
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,230
customer, sorry, while
they're waiting in queue.

1065
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:45,030
At the same time, the
whisper message for the agent

1066
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,440
is also being retrieved

1067
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,400
and it will be ready

1068
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,290
when the customer is
transferred to the agent.

1069
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,230
There's a lot of other
services that were used

1070
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,990
to build ultimately,

1071
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,560
again, I mentioned R on Snowflake earlier,

1072
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,010
to build the risk scores
and the audience segments.

1073
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,380
A lot of analytics tools that were used,

1074
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,263
visualization, like
Tableau, as shown here.

1075
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,860
Lots and lots of things that went behind,

1076
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,110
services that went into
this behind the scenes

1077
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,580
to build the model,

1078
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,400
but on a daily basis, on a per call basis,

1079
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,310
Dynamo, Lambda, Salesforce,

1080
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,060
Kinesis to stream out the
analytics data to Verint today.

1081
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,240
All of these services are
used on every single call,

1082
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,340
providing that personalized experience.

1083
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,190
And what this does, this is
just the first phase, right?

1084
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,390
So the data's gonna continue
to be analyzed and looked at,

1085
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,833
and again, we've got the, I say we,

1086
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,260
the team collectively analyzing the data

1087
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,633
and this can be continually improved on.

1088
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,873
So, you know, just really exciting stuff.

1089
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,333
So what's next?

1090
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,560
As we are looking out into 2026

1091
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,750
and some enhancements
that can be made here,

1092
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,470
one of the big items that
stands out is an integration,

1093
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,630
a deeper integration with Salesforce.

1094
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:14,130
And this is really going
to provide benefits

1095
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,240
not only for the customers
of Covered California

1096
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,640
by providing self-service,

1097
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,460
like personalized
self-service when you call in.

1098
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,100
Again, lookups can be
made back into Salesforce

1099
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,370
and that personalized, like,
self-service information

1100
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:33,900
could be provided back right in the IVR.

1101
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,540
But also a lot of agent assistance.

1102
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,930
So things like dynamically
providing answers to questions

1103
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,670
to the agent, like, live

1104
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,500
while the conversation is happening.

1105
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,750
A summary of contacts when it's over.

1106
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,450
So instead of spending 60
seconds or two minutes,

1107
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,070
like, typing up a summary

1108
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,990
of what just happened on that contact,

1109
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,570
just use AI to provide a
summary of that contact

1110
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,920
and move on to the next one.

1111
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,500
That not only helps with
that particular call,

1112
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,333
but the next call.

1113
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,440
When that person calls again,

1114
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,870
now you can you say, "Oh, I
see you talked to this person

1115
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,880
and you talked about this," right?

1116
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,910
It helps all along the way.

1117
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,910
So, you know, just announced
this week at re:Invent

1118
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,440
some of what that looks like here.

1119
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,410
Salesforce contact center
with Amazon Connect.

1120
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,520
An inbound call comes in in
the Salesforce interface.

1121
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,170
An agent doesn't have to leave,

1122
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,240
so they're not working
from multiple screens.

1123
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,080
They can answer.

1124
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,330
This is just a chat in this case,

1125
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,771
but that customer's record is pulled up.

1126
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,530
So now the agent has a view

1127
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,570
of all of that customer's information,

1128
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,030
previous contact information,

1129
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,130
you know, everything about them.

1130
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,200
As they start chatting,

1131
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,170
this is not a Covered California example,

1132
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,110
so if you need help with
generator installation,

1133
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,310
that's what this is about.

1134
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,910
But, you know, I need some
help installing a generator,

1135
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,710
well, live while they're talking,

1136
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,670
or in this case, it's chat,

1137
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,370
but this works with voice as well,

1138
00:46:02,484 --> 00:46:07,484
Amazon Connect, through
Salesforce, is providing answers

1139
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,220
to that customer's question
or to their inquiry live.

1140
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,420
And as an agent now,

1141
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,820
I don't have to, like,
"Let me put you on hold

1142
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,470
and go look that information up."

1143
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,373
That information is being
brought right to the agent live.

1144
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,320
In this case, because it's a chat,

1145
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,900
they could literally just
copy it and paste it in,

1146
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,640
helping that customer.

1147
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,500
We could provide sources to that.

1148
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,330
So if you needed to dive deeper

1149
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,700
or, you know, look up more
information, you could.

1150
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,250
And down here, I kind of
cut it off on the screen,

1151
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,290
but an agent could even just type in here

1152
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,400
and just ask questions

1153
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,260
if they wanted to ask deeper questions

1154
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,510
about this particular topic.

1155
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,117
But all of this now is
going to help answer

1156
00:46:45,117 --> 00:46:47,050
the customer's question faster

1157
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,920
and ultimately, you know, just provide

1158
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,460
a better customer experience

1159
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:55,143
for customers of California.

1160
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,473
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.

1161
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,560
- I think just a couple
of thoughts to close

1162
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,430
and to take away.

1163
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,030
One, we started this journey
looking for partners,

1164
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,863
not for vendors,

1165
00:47:06,863 --> 00:47:09,000
but for human beings who had affinity

1166
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,400
for those three care-abouts I
talked about earlier, right?

1167
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,350
Our obsessions, our mission.

1168
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,330
Affordable, high-quality
healthcare is a right

1169
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:18,030
for every resident of
the state of California.

1170
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,130
That second one about the consumer journey

1171
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,200
and trying to remove impedance

1172
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,150
or friction from that journey

1173
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,990
so that consumers can get
from point A to point Z fast,

1174
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,820
speedy, with no issues,

1175
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,650
and feel confident that
they have the right solution

1176
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,150
at the end of that journey.

1177
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,580
And obviously information
security and privacy.

1178
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,530
So those three care-abouts,

1179
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,720
we have two fantastic partners in Deloitte

1180
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,830
as our system integrator

1181
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:45,090
and AWS as our infrastructure provider.

1182
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,240
These folks, these human
beings have the same affinity

1183
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,800
for our mission that we do, right?

1184
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Glenn and I are, we're employees
of the state of California.

1185
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,850
And so we're here

1186
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,190
because we wanted to
do this mission thing.

1187
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,477
We have two partners who are also here

1188
00:47:57,477 --> 00:48:00,210
and we treat them like they're
our employees as well, right?

1189
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,280
We are all colleagues.

1190
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,040
I think the second thing is
we spent a lot of time today

1191
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,700
talking about data and AI and ML

1192
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,376
and it's really the transition

1193
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:14,610
or translation of data into insight

1194
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:15,873
that AI and ML gives us,

1195
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,190
that insight that actually
drives action, right?

1196
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,660
The insight that drives action,

1197
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,910
like, "Hey, 30% of your people are leaving

1198
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:24,743
and never coming back.

1199
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:26,070
What are you gonna do about it?"

1200
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,337
The insight that drives action of,

1201
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,040
"Hey, let's create a custom message

1202
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,720
and a custom outreach campaign

1203
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,340
that will get every single human being

1204
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,220
to think I am thinking about
you in this transaction,

1205
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,080
I'm thinking about your family
and what your needs are,

1206
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,700
and I'm giving you a custom plan

1207
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,520
and I'm explaining it in a language

1208
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,410
and in a method that you can understand

1209
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,400
and take action on too."

1210
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,280
So it's that transformation of data

1211
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,750
into insight that drives action,

1212
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,620
which is really at the heart

1213
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,283
of the two use cases that we provided.

1214
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,820
Anything else to add, Glenn?

1215
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,760
- We're just excited to
keep this going forward

1216
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,290
and this is just the beginning

1217
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,210
and we've done this collectively

1218
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,650
in a very short period of time.

1219
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,680
So we're excited to keep charging ahead.

1220
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,880
- Yeah, great.

1221
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,020
Thank you for your time this afternoon.

1222
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,550
We enjoyed telling you our story.

1223
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,890
And we'll be at the back of
the room if you have questions.

1224
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,847
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

1225
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:18,847
(audience applauds)
