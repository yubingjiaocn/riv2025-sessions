1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,140
- Thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,810
We appreciate you guys
spending your hour with us.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,160
My name's Chris Hallenbeck.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,270
I'm the general manager of
AI and platform for Boomi

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,520
and my colleague Thomas Benjamin,

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
he's gonna be presenting in a minute,

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,771
you don't have to come up

8
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,560
but he is the senior vice
president of engineering

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,540
and he's gonna come up and
talk about the technical.

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,940
So we're basically gonna do talk about

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,773
for the first half

12
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:24,610
to really get into why
governance of agents

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,560
and what does that actually mean.

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,270
We're really actually not
talking about agents per se,

15
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,580
we're talking about agentic workflows

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,310
'cause that's really where
you ended up with the impact.

17
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,760
Not so much, not so much agents,
we'll talk about that more.

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,810
But then getting into,

19
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,460
and then Thomas is gonna actually get into

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,020
the technical side of things

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,490
of how do you actually do this?

22
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,930
Not with your, with your own agents.

23
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,520
That might not be so bad

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,520
but our customers are living
in multi-agent worlds.

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,509
They're moving in, they
are going to be using stuff

26
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,080
whether it's Anthropic and Open AI

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,400
and building stuff in LangChain

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,330
and using stuff from Salesforce
and Microsoft and ServiceNow

29
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,116
and how do I actually have

30
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,470
a common governance layer for that

31
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,410
and do that in a way
that I can actually do

32
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,940
true workflows that are governed.

33
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,190
Things like finance,

34
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,740
manual journal entry reconciliation,

35
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,780
doing goods receipt,
invoice reconciliation,

36
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,730
things that an auditor
is gonna come through.

37
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,870
Or if I'm in pharma

38
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,850
and I'm looking at staying compliant

39
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,340
with overall regulatory,
how do I do that in a way?

40
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,070
What do we actually need to
do to become enterprise class?

41
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,920
And that's what we're gonna get into.

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,086
But first let's talk about Boomi.

43
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,669
(lively music)

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,100
So it's funny to see that,

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,540
'cause that's just from a few months ago

46
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,460
and I'm gonna, I actually
show you updated ones.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,200
Talked about 33,000 agents.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,097
That number almost doubled today.

49
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,680
So we will talk a more.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,230
Some of you guys may know Boomi
really well, your customers,

51
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,910
you've enjoyed us for years,

52
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,770
you're extremely passionate

53
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,890
and you're like I know all about you.

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,964
And then actually the other one,

55
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:41,190
which is people either say that completely

56
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,450
or they're like, I've never heard of you.

57
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,590
Which is fair.

58
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,780
'Cause if you're not literally
in the integration space

59
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,790
historically you wouldn't know about us.

60
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,070
Boomi has been around for quite a while.

61
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,190
We have, as you can see
here, over 25,000 customers.

62
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,360
You look at the logos and you're like,

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,130
I know almost all of those.

64
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,963
Yes.

65
00:02:56,963 --> 00:02:57,960
And that means they're actually running

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,840
their integration processes
on Boomi if they're up here.

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,540
800 plus global partners

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,493
and over 300,000 users
on our system every day.

69
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,120
People also kind of get into it

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,795
and what we've been
known for really of late

71
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,780
is in the right hand graphic,

72
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,640
which was Bea Gartner's Magic Quadrant.

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,500
And you're taking a look at
and you're hunting for Boomi

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,380
and look in the top right
hand corner and you see Boomi,

75
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,780
and for integration platform as a service,

76
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,790
which is really what we're known for.

77
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,430
What people hadn't known
for which just got released

78
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,200
was the left hand graphic,

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,780
which is now you see is
one of the top four vendors

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,260
is Boomi the API management space as well

81
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,110
where we've been doing a
huge amount of innovation.

82
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,080
What I always find really
interesting about these charts,

83
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,270
most people look at them as a snapshot

84
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,710
and you actually, it's not.

85
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,570
Everybody is innovating and working

86
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,730
and the requirements to be in that segment

87
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,620
are constantly evolving.

88
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,960
So really what this is, is a window

89
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,940
that is moving upwards

90
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,680
with people with innovation.

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,570
Those, and you'll see some
names, you're like, wow,

92
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,550
they're not even in the
magic quadrant anymore.

93
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,740
Those are folks that actually didn't,

94
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,120
their product just stifled.

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,953
It just stopped.

96
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,850
People stopped innovating in it.

97
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,860
They might have done some
things, it didn't hit,

98
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,810
they didn't read and
talk to their customers.

99
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,726
And then you see the ones

100
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:15,990
that actually moved up into that right.

101
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,360
That means they weren't just
moving up at market speed,

102
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,000
they were outperforming
the market dramatically.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,348
And that's what Boomi has been doing.

104
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,690
We could talk about this in
data management and others.

105
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,460
In every segment, Boomi year to year

106
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,933
is going up into the right.

107
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,280
Now why is it, and why are,

108
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,980
why are the analysts saying Boomi

109
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,750
is this one that's kind of on fire.

110
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,670
Why is Boomi listening us

111
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,620
with the biggest companies in the industry

112
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,770
as it pertains to AI and
shortlist of like five,

113
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,663
you see these huge names

114
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:46,496
and then you're like Boomi, what?

115
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:47,329
How did they do that?

116
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,343
The key to this is actually
what's in the platform.

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,050
So of course we have
integration and automation,

118
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,183
for those are guys who aren't in this

119
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,400
'cause you might come from
the AI space or another area,

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,310
integration where we're
taking business processes

121
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,830
that link between multiple systems

122
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,371
and actually directly connecting them.

123
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,740
So those processes can work successfully.

124
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,300
But integration only gets you

125
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,970
common language, common speaking.

126
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,240
To make them work
together takes automation,

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,438
all the different steps in there.

128
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,098
And what becomes really important here

129
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,190
is we're beginning to,
we'll quickly get into AI

130
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,140
'cause that's why you all came,

131
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,240
was to actually start to say

132
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,180
some things that I'm hooking
up to, let's say an API,

133
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,490
it might actually be
kind of a very old, old,

134
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,710
old crud based API.

135
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,838
And so where I might have
to actually do a huge number

136
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,770
of invocations to achieve any
given single business process,

137
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,020
creating a customer, generating out,

138
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,261
taking a quote to an order

139
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,010
which either might be
multi-step integration,

140
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,220
Boomi can change all that
and make that in, expose that

141
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,320
as sort of a business level API

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,540
and then we handle
everything in the background.

143
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,330
Likewise, you might have
an incredible business API,

144
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,370
which is actually then developed out

145
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,500
and might expose too much capability.

146
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,940
For security and other reasons,

147
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,273
you might actually wanna
create slices of that

148
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:07,200
of capability and integration

149
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,840
and limit that again through automation,

150
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,160
then exposing that,

151
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,690
just become very relevant

152
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,300
as you start out exposing API

153
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,883
within agentic.

154
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,430
Now we get into data management.

155
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,070
Data management is getting
at two different areas.

156
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,720
We're talking about data management

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,580
in terms of data quality.

158
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,840
How can I actually go in

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,738
and start creating master data records

160
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,090
or any object that needs to
have extremely high quality

161
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,780
and do that using both
traditional rule-based logic

162
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,050
as well as using agents to
actually cleanse my data,

163
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,870
and actually creating
fully cleaned repositories

164
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,490
of that information?

165
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,830
Now that can be foreign integration

166
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,140
because we know that an integration breaks

167
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,780
when the data doesn't align
on two different places.

168
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,160
Most companies don't have

169
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,410
full master data management systems.

170
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,410
IT is still stuck with a
problem of quality data.

171
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,450
They're the ones dealing
with a catch block

172
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,060
full of errors every
morning when they walk in

173
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,830
and then manually having to fix that.

174
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,240
The business is blaming them

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,040
for having written a poor integration,

176
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,660
which in when it was really the business

177
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,493
who wouldn't invest in clean data.

178
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,070
But they're stuck with this.

179
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,840
So what our customers are doing is saying,

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,950
I'm gonna solve that

181
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,310
and I use Boomi to automatically
do record cleansing

182
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,730
and then if they wish to
synchronize that data back out

183
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,770
to the transactional systems.

184
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,270
But now that we're actually onto,

185
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,450
so we have those capabilities
in there to move both agents

186
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,870
and rule-based data to
create cleansed data

187
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,490
and actually store that in a repository

188
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,860
if you want for performance reasons.

189
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,260
The next thing that people also want to do

190
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,333
is actually do data integration,

191
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,690
because we have to move the data around.

192
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,450
This is data that is coming
through web services,

193
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,660
APIs, from databases and others

194
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,010
that I need to move,

195
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,340
whether that is from a workday,
from an SAP, from NetSuite

196
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,277
and I need to bring that in.

197
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,430
Obviously that was key
to being able to do that

198
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,260
for master data management

199
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,110
or within an integration
to make sure it's working.

200
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,600
But equally just 'cause
I have to get the data,

201
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Let's say I want to get it
into Snowflake or Databricks

202
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,520
or I want get it into
like an Azure, you know,

203
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,740
into a data lake that I wanna work for.

204
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,790
We have to get that done.

205
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,350
And how do I move that down?

206
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,260
Boomi will auto generate using AI,

207
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,620
the actual extractor endpoint
into things like web services

208
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,960
automatically just by
reading the documentation.

209
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,660
So you don't have to have us support every

210
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,980
different application out there.

211
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,750
We do that automatically.

212
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,360
Then we do the change data
capture on your behalf

213
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,650
to move that data through.

214
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,200
And then it's also, it
has schema evolution.

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,630
So as that upstream system
automatically changes,

216
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,760
we notice that, move the data down

217
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,470
in the data serialization format,

218
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,300
update the downstream schema

219
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,250
so that your integrations don't break

220
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,840
as you're doing your
extract transform load

221
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:51,930
or extract load transform processes

222
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,240
based on what you want to achieve.

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,630
Now the big one with
agentic is API management.

224
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,970
And again I said Boomi
has now moved into the top

225
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,400
of the magic quadrant for that as well.

226
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
And that is because of
our API control plane.

227
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,500
You have old systems from TIBCO,

228
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,350
you have more legacy
systems from those guys

229
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,300
like Mule or Microsoft

230
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,869
and then you have the more modern systems

231
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:15,702
from folks like Kong.

232
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,930
And you have those, but now
I need a common control plane

233
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,390
in which I can manage all
those from a security,

234
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,740
from a buffering

235
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,160
and from an overall security standpoint.

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,973
But equally now I want to
expose those as MCP servers.

237
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,385
So how can I then expose
various API endpoints?

238
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,130
And this gets to my point

239
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,830
that I made at the beginning
about API management.

240
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,810
You don't just take a raw API

241
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,160
and expose it to an agent

242
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,113
when you're trying to create context.

243
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,880
It can't speak to a crud
API very successfully.

244
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,340
I need to actually take automation code

245
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,770
that then brings that out,

246
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,050
expose out that once I've created

247
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,240
that into a business friendly API

248
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,350
and expose that new API endpoint as,

249
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,240
as an MCP server.

250
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,740
Boomi does that automatically.

251
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,430
Likewise, I may have one
that is way too powerful.

252
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,410
Yes, delete, skim, drop customer

253
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,210
and I don't want to make
everybody have that.

254
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,700
I don't wanna give an agent that ability.

255
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,690
So I cut down the
capability using my code,

256
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,200
using my automation code to
actually bring that down,

257
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,430
narrow down its capabilities

258
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,563
before exposing it as an MCP server.

259
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,050
Then we actually get
down into API management.

260
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,530
And this is the ability not
only to create, we are not,

261
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,790
I wanna say before I get into this,

262
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,383
we are not an AI company.

263
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,683
We are not trying to be Anthropic,

264
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,850
we are not trying to be Open AI,

265
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,750
what we are as a company
that helps you activate AI

266
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,000
in your business processes.

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,920
How can I take Anthropic?

268
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,960
How can I take Open AI?

269
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,670
How can I take my own models

270
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,920
that have built in things like LangChain

271
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,390
or any of the other vendors
I mentioned earlier.

272
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,600
How can I leverage those in
my own business processes

273
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,520
where the true value lies?

274
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,080
Now I can't do that unless

275
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,420
I have the enterprise class features,

276
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,050
which means I have the security,

277
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,850
the observability,

278
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,380
the governance

279
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,600
and yes, scalability in order to do that.

280
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,430
And that's what this whole thing is about.

281
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,440
How do we actually get all those pieces

282
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,290
so that once I have my agentic workflows,

283
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,570
I actually have all that in place

284
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,013
so that I can move these into production.

285
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,520
So Agent Studio has first
the ability to build agents.

286
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,600
Agents are easy by the way.

287
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,010
Building an agent takes you like

288
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,300
maybe five minutes on the outside.

289
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,830
Everyone's talking about agents, ooh.

290
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,270
You're like they're really simple.

291
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,270
Now to build one that automatically

292
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,030
has built-in guardrails
lets you add guardrails,

293
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,020
automatically is checking

294
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,520
for things like prompt injection

295
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,640
and yields extremely
high quality responses,

296
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,110
even under multi invocation

297
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,390
with short-term memory built in,

298
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,350
not so easy.

299
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,320
Boomi does that extraordinarily well.

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,470
Then beyond that, we also
then have the ability

301
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,410
to then move those into our control plane.

302
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,740
And in that control
plane I can actually take

303
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,972
and manage not only those
agents built by Boomi,

304
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:12,210
and again, we're not
building our own models,

305
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,120
we're leveraging those
models from major vendors

306
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,210
within your work in, in your work.

307
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,010
I'm then putting that into a place

308
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,540
where I can have complete governance.

309
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,060
I have all that
observability based into it

310
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,970
and I have all the audit
trails that I need.

311
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,820
And not doing it just for
the agents built on Boomi,

312
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,850
but doing it for an entirely
huge host of vendors

313
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,770
so I can have a common control plane

314
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,540
and bring under control to sprawl

315
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,120
that we've been seeing from
all these different vendors.

316
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,680
And how do I begin to manage them

317
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,740
and make sure I don't have
security issues internally.

318
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,760
And then I'm also dealing

319
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,400
with all the governance
issues associated with them.

320
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,630
And then the last point

321
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,190
is how can I then take
those agents trivially

322
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,820
and drop them into my workflow

323
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,676
so they're running headless?

324
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,150
We're all used to conversational UIs,

325
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,890
but in the world in which I live in,

326
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,330
it's all business processes.

327
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,430
How can I take an agent
and just drag and drop it

328
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,430
onto a canvas in which
it's part of my workflow,

329
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,875
a mixed of API endpoints,

330
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:11,040
pulling that data out
of web services, others.

331
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,250
I've got classic if then
else deterministic logic

332
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,310
mixed through in with agents

333
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,256
and flowing all that
data through from point

334
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,350
to paying using data serialized
format, typically JSON,

335
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,050
but whatever you really,
whatever you love.

336
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,490
What that which we call
"agent step" allows us to use

337
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,463
agents in a true agentic workflow fashion.

338
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,340
True agentic meaning,

339
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,510
I have perception.

340
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,450
I have an agent that gets
called, it has a goal

341
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,930
and it has tools to reach out

342
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,610
and speak to all the different systems

343
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,550
to build its context in
order to do reasoning.

344
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,980
So it can perceive its environment,

345
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,713
it can pull in everything
to create its context.

346
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,350
It will then perceive through

347
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,720
and reason through everything it needs to

348
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,370
to come to a conclusion.

349
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,680
We control all those instructions,

350
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,570
then has the ability to act

351
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,750
by then calling business processes.

352
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,390
So yes, it can go human in the loop

353
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,940
or human on the loop if we
want to involve somebody,

354
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,890
but if you want it directly to say

355
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,410
yes, I did a three-way match onsite,

356
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,520
this good receipt in,

357
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,590
good receipt invoice reconciliation,

358
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,900
notify the ERP that this invoice is good

359
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,820
and they can go ahead and make payment

360
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,470
and by the way, notify

361
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,220
and kick off the process to
the warehouse management system

362
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,710
to automatically receive
the associated goods

363
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,600
and to general availability.

364
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
That's exactly what our
customers are using Boomi to do.

365
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,910
So full,

366
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,290
perceive,

367
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,570
reason, act.

368
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,850
And I can do, we can do
that in a conversational UI,

369
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,710
but more importantly our customers do this

370
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,040
directly within process flows.

371
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,050
And then again, Thomas
gonna explain how we do that

372
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,160
with complete governance.

373
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,020
So I can be doing it in that,

374
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,334
in that workflow I just
described, which is in finance

375
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,660
where Ernst and Young's gonna
show up very shortly and audit

376
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,100
and see how you did that

377
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,230
to make sure you have all the information.

378
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,940
And to do that in a world

379
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,340
where I can't not only use a Boomi agent

380
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,780
but I can actually use agents

381
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,580
from all those different vendors

382
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,671
and I can drag them into
Boomi specific processes

383
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:17,040
if I wanna do that as well.

384
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,640
That comes out in about a month.

385
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,510
And that's what our platform is.

386
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,650
These are the updated numbers.

387
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,803
62,000 agents currently in production.

388
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,353
13,000, sorry, 12,000 of
those are agentic workflows.

389
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,070
The 50,000 are actually people using

390
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,710
built in agents in the Boomi platform

391
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,740
to make Boomi run run better for them.

392
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,380
IT doing this to write their documentation

393
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,380
against their APIs, both
technical and business,

394
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,270
to help them auto gen out
their entire agentic workflows

395
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,080
describing a problem and having
to do that automatically.

396
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,760
These things like Boomi design gen,

397
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,210
so these are prebuilt agents.

398
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,649
And then we have the next 12,000

399
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,331
is where people are actually building out

400
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:03,690
agent workflows themselves,

401
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,550
partners, customers and others

402
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,530
and deploying those into workflows

403
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,580
and then managing and monitoring those

404
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,180
within Boomi's Agent Control Tower.

405
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,640
Our own, our own results are up there,

406
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,600
97% in reduction in
response time for our own,

407
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,420
we call it Boomi on Boomi
where we use our own platform

408
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,280
to support our own customers.

409
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,800
50% faster issue resolution

410
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,493
and an 80% drop in documentation
time for our own work.

411
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,240
So again, I talk about what an agent is

412
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,010
and I kind of want to hammer this home.

413
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,680
The ability to perceive, reason and act

414
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,843
is truly what agentic means.

415
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,833
Within that, you have tools.

416
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,520
Now everyone's like MCP solves everything.

417
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,430
Well not if it's gonna run
you four or 500 milliseconds

418
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,050
in time on a hop.

419
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,600
Yeah, that might be fine
for a conversational agent,

420
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,970
but that is not okay
for a business process.

421
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,910
I need to be able to have
native tooling to do that.

422
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,040
Boomi allows you to prototype an MCP,

423
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,810
go production if you also want.

424
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,760
I can literally just drag and
drop and go to a native tool,

425
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,540
whether it's an API, a web service,

426
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,950
a database call, et cetera,

427
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,320
all listed out my tools that are reusable.

428
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,060
I drag and drop them in

429
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,670
with full delegated authority.

430
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,590
Now we do that.

431
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,590
That creates the understanding
to build that context window.

432
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,170
Then the agent itself, as you
see on the right hand side,

433
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,470
can actually directly
call off and execute.

434
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,000
It can do task management,

435
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,860
send messages in Slack.

436
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,430
It can go ahead and notify
somebody in a ServiceNow ticket

437
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,000
or it can kickoff a
business process directly

438
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
as I talked about like
in the three-way match.

439
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,750
That's what agentic processing is

440
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,380
and this is what is required
to do this at scale.

441
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,580
This is the execution.

442
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,460
And then we're gonna be getting
into the governance side.

443
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,690
Now for a minute,

444
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,290
why do we keep hammering on
this agentic workflow issue?

445
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,963
It's 'cause it's where
the business value is.

446
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,040
We have these things and
most, if you're dealing

447
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,200
and if you deal internally
with your customers

448
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,294
or if you're a partner and you're dealing

449
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:10,127
with your own clients,

450
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,120
I can tell you they're currently confused.

451
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,040
We built this slide as an aside

452
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,140
and people now it's
like their favorite one.

453
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,600
They keep going, go
back, go back, go back.

454
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,550
Because they don't understand the taxonomy

455
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,320
of what's happening within AI.

456
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,680
They're thinking about things like Copilot

457
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,980
and confusing it with an agentic workflow.

458
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,070
So these things that are
these horizontal systems

459
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,820
like a chatbot or something that is an,

460
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,008
or something that's coding assistant,

461
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,840
like a Windsor for a cursor.

462
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,030
Super cool, not the same thing though.

463
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,760
They confuse those with
what is actually helping

464
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,620
what we're talking about on the bottom,

465
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,810
which is actually dealing with,

466
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,560
with line of business,
specific business processes

467
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,880
and how do I rethink them using agentic.

468
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,530
And that's what we're doing with Boomi.

469
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,680
It's also why we are so
passionate about governance

470
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,870
because these workflows, you have to,

471
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,300
auditors come around and
see what you've been doing.

472
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,045
They don't really care
how you use a chatbot.

473
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,620
They don't care about
how you book your travel

474
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,970
with an AI agent.

475
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,880
These are not the core
processes that help a business.

476
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,740
But it's also actually why you go in

477
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,180
and why McKinsey says

478
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,633
that these systems have
very little business value.

479
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,930
Eight, and you know as they look at it,

480
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,715
of the companies doing it,

481
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:27,548
McKinsey came out in June

482
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:29,940
with their CEO report on agentic

483
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,904
and saying eight in 10
companies send gen AI

484
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,004
has had no significant bottom line impact.

485
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,560
And what they do, and they talk about,

486
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,060
you're gonna read the quote here,

487
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,360
there is an imbalance
between horizontal chatbots.

488
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,620
That's what you saw.

489
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,970
Not Windsurf and Cursor,

490
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,530
but the other ones

491
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,350
which have scaled quickly but deliver

492
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,633
diffuse hard to measure gains,

493
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,060
and more transformative vertical use cases

494
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,550
that remain stuck in pilot mode.

495
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,930
Now I happen to come from the team

496
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,430
that wrote this in McKinsey

497
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,560
and I was there, I left right
before they wrote this paper.

498
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,170
So I called 'em up and I said, you guys,

499
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,080
how come when you wrote that
and you quoted the stat there,

500
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,467
was it because it,

501
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,260
was because you can't
get out of pilot mode

502
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,792
because you the piece systems were not

503
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,100
designed with enterprise class features.

504
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,180
And I said security,
governance and observability.

505
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,810
And they said yes, but you
also forgot scalability.

506
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,160
Because if I build something

507
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,800
with like eight different
projects, this open source code,

508
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,010
this customer this, API
management here and there

509
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,380
for one use case,

510
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,150
when I go to scale that up,

511
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,710
they all scale asymmetrically

512
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,260
and all our integration code breaks

513
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,790
and that's only one use case.

514
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,350
They can't even get into production.

515
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,478
Forget about doing this at scale

516
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,300
with hundreds of thousands of
agents from different vendors.

517
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,570
It does not work to do
this without a platform.

518
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,839
And that is exactly what also,

519
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,736
and then everyone's talked
about the MIT study.

520
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:56,569
MIT came back and said,

521
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,443
actually we think McKinsey
underestimated it.

522
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:00,480
Here they went in,

523
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,760
the end value here for
the number of projects

524
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,210
looked at was 300

525
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,370
and then they did about
a, there was 152 responses

526
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,500
or thereabouts for written responses

527
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,240
in an academic ridiculous way,

528
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,760
as well as 52 interviews
that were structured.

529
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,830
And they came away and said,

530
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,610
there is only one
definitive causal difference

531
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,780
between the 95% failure
and the 5% successful

532
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,970
from an ROI perspective.

533
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,370
And they said it was integration.

534
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,380
They then came in and said
number two was education.

535
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,520
But the only thing

536
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,760
that was statistically
significant was integration.

537
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,143
Agents are easy.

538
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,650
Giving them the context
through integration

539
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,830
and having all the enterprise
class features to go,

540
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,520
to go live and in production,
that is really hard.

541
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,820
And that was what we
have focused on at Boomi.

542
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,900
So here right now, you can see as we go,

543
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,180
this is talking about,

544
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,783
we have 360 applications on
average in an enterprise,

545
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:02,940
10,000 APIs.

546
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,620
And we're all used to that sprawl

547
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,180
and the problem that has happened,

548
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,740
40% get one monitored.

549
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,970
We have these ghost APIs,

550
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,860
all these security threats internally.

551
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,690
And then you have over thousands

552
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,490
of data sources and databases.

553
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,260
And now people are worried about,

554
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,840
and we're already hearing
about it extensively,

555
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,520
which is AI sprawl or agent sprawl.

556
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,760
Everybody in the company is
playing with different vendors.

557
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,713
Nobody is thinking about security.

558
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,870
They're literally giving
chat, you know, ChatGPT access

559
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,330
to their financial system
or their HR system.

560
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,533
What could go wrong?

561
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,920
Let's just give 'em a system
password and let it go.

562
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,850
No.

563
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,260
I kid, but it's actually,

564
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,030
you'd be shocked at how many people

565
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,754
think about those things

566
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,450
and didn't really think about
the security implications

567
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,080
or how to have auditing and
logging to know how it happened.

568
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,570
So agentic sprawl is real.

569
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,420
How do you manage it in a
multi-vendor environment?

570
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,559
And I'm gonna leave off here

571
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,540
and I'm gonna have somebody
explain all of this to you,

572
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,140
which is my colleague, Benjamin.

573
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,676
- Thank you, Chris.

574
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,576
(audience applauds)

575
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:08,070
Chris.

576
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,420
Now like Chris has mentioned,

577
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,220
every organization is struggling

578
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,380
with the sprawl of applications,

579
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,630
APIs, data sources,

580
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,710
and now it's further
compounded with AI agents

581
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,420
and the new challenge it introduces,

582
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,820
which is non-deterministic behavior.

583
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,650
And this is where the Boomi platform

584
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,320
for agentic automation comes into play.

585
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,530
The platform supports a
whole set of use cases,

586
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,150
which you see on the auto parameter,

587
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,500
like lead to cash, hire
to retire, et cetera.

588
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,840
Now the four pillars of the platform

589
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,370
are integration and automation.

590
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,910
So you can essentially integrate
your Salesforce application

591
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,630
to your ERP application,
whether it's Oracle or SAP.

592
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,390
You can integrate Workday to your ERP

593
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,232
or integrate the ERP to ServiceNow,

594
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,560
any kind of permutation and combination.

595
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,930
This is the integration
process that we've had

596
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,140
for over two decades that in
a low-code, no-code manner

597
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,730
that all of you could use.

598
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,570
You could now expose that
integration process as an API.

599
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,320
And with the MCP bridge
capability that we have released,

600
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,500
we can release MCP servers
with a single toggle

601
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,160
where the API can become
an MCP enabled tool

602
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,650
that you can use in your agentic workflow.

603
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,560
And this is where the API
management pillar comes in

604
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,120
where we have API gateways

605
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,460
and a control plane
that Chris talked about,

606
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,620
which helps you federate across

607
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,780
multiple API gateway providers

608
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,090
like Apogee, Kong, Gravity, name it.

609
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,490
We support (mumbles) API providers.

610
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,940
And with the MCP bridge capability,

611
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,460
we can MCP enable every API

612
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,890
that you have within your ecosystem.

613
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,210
And then to complement that

614
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,820
and to set the whole
agentic workflow together,

615
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,600
we have the agent data
management ECA system,

616
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,340
which essentially brings in data

617
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,040
because data is the feeder for AI.

618
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,040
We bring in data through
ETL ELT capability,

619
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,260
traditional methods by EDI,

620
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,620
modern techniques like
ELT change data capture.

621
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,560
And we stitch master data
from multiple applications

622
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,830
that are needed for the
agentic workflows to execute,

623
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,596
whether it's Salesforce,
whether it's ServiceNow,

624
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,510
whether it's Shopify, Oracle, SAP.

625
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,980
We have a seamless mechanism

626
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,140
of stitching master data together.

627
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,480
And this feeds into our agentic ecosystem,

628
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,780
which is developed, run by
our agent management module,

629
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,350
which is made up of four
foundational building blocks.

630
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,330
One is the agent designer,

631
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,070
a low-code, no-code mechanism

632
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,620
by which you can design AI agents

633
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,250
all built on foundational
AWS Bedrock elements.

634
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,530
Next is our agent orchestrator,

635
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,990
which helps you
orchestrate multiple agents

636
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,620
and tools together as part
of your agentic workflow.

637
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,510
And then of course the agent governance,

638
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,510
which gives you the ability
to observe these agents,

639
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,290
look for anomalies, look for
latency within the agents,

640
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,900
and actually perform
actions on the agents.

641
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,360
And as we unpeel the
architecture into a few layers,

642
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,530
I'll actually show you

643
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,760
how this is actually done,

644
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,370
especially with the
case of Bedrock agents.

645
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,110
And then of course we have a marketplace

646
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,850
where all this could be exposed

647
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,410
into the Boomi's marketplace

648
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,640
or also could be exposed

649
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,380
to the Bedrock marketplace essentially.

650
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,140
So this is kind of a
hundred thousand perspective

651
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,270
of the enterprise architecture diagram

652
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,853
for Boomi's agentic automation platform.

653
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,260
Now why do we need to govern these agents?

654
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,760
Like Chris mentioned,

655
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,080
there is a lot of challenges

656
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,060
when you integrate multiple applications.

657
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,400
It's very easy to
integrate two applications,

658
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,450
but when you try to integrate
your Salesforce application

659
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,740
to your ERP system

660
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,900
to incident management system,

661
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,030
the complexity just compounds.

662
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,160
So this is why of governance of agents

663
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,990
coming from multiple providers

664
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,990
and multiple tools coming
from multiple providers

665
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,070
is extremely key.

666
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,960
And that's what we focused on.

667
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,110
The governance is focused
on three core tenants.

668
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,030
First is universal observability,

669
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,710
the ability to observe

670
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,810
the right attributes that you have shared

671
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,880
with the Boomi Agent Control Tower

672
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,680
so that we can collect these attributes,

673
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,150
stitch these attributes,

674
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,500
look for anomalies

675
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,140
and even leading indicators to an anomaly

676
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,880
so that you can do something about it

677
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,860
before an anomaly happens.

678
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,470
And the third pillar is doing something.

679
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,530
As you know, there are no
standards for agents yet.

680
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,630
So the actions that the agent perform

681
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,760
is quite different with each framework.

682
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,010
Some frameworks let you stop, stop,

683
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,270
start, and stop an agent.

684
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,090
Some frameworks let you
quarantine an agent.

685
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,760
So we aggregate all
these different actions

686
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,980
across the different framework providers

687
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,100
so that you can perform an
action when an anomaly happens

688
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,170
across multiple providers.

689
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,090
And in the next few slides and demos,

690
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,390
I'll actually show you how
this all unpeels itself.

691
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,240
The video that you see
on play is just a quick

692
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,960
thumbs eye view of the
actual Agent Control Tower

693
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,000
that we're talking about.

694
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,570
So let me unpeel the
architecture of further layer.

695
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,890
The Agent Studio of Boomi

696
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,870
has got three code building blocks.

697
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,180
First is the agent designer,

698
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,710
and again in the Agent Control Tower,

699
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,530
you don't have to design agents
with Boomi's agent designer.

700
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,680
You can design it from multiple
providers like Bedrock,

701
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,613
Salesforce, LangChain, Crew AI, name it.

702
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:17,460
But the Boomi agent designer
lets you use natural language

703
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,070
to provide instructions
to design the agent.

704
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,080
It lets you pick your foundation model.

705
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,660
Today we support Cloud family of models.

706
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,880
We've been prototyping newer models

707
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,890
and very soon we'll
open up to other models

708
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,720
from other different providers.

709
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,450
Next is we allow you to expose tools

710
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,540
as APIs, as tools through our MCP bridge,

711
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,490
or you can bring in your own MCP servers

712
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,080
that you can hook up to it

713
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,700
and then you can add memory,

714
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,060
knowledge basis and
guardrails to your agents.

715
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,710
Now once you've designed the agents,

716
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,030
you can execute the agent.

717
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,830
The executing environment for agents

718
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,910
is what we call our agent
garden or agent runtime,

719
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,640
where you have the agent
executor for the Boomi agents,

720
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,500
the tool executor for all the tools

721
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,350
that we MCP enable within Boomi.

722
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,080
And then of course the agent orchestrator,

723
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,880
which orchestrates the activity

724
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,250
or interactions between
these multiple agents

725
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,720
from different providers

726
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,450
as well as different tools
coming from different providers,

727
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,830
not just Boomi.

728
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,710
In addition to that, we
also have a chat interface

729
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,900
that lets you essentially examine

730
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,090
how your agent is performing in action

731
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,490
or multiple agents are
performing in action

732
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,710
in your actual order to cash process

733
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,290
or hire to retire process as an example.

734
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,990
And now let's come to the
Boomi Agent Control Tower.

735
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,720
The Control Tower is
where the real governance

736
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,670
of agents actually happens.

737
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,180
The Control Tower picks up
observability attributes,

738
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,220
and with that you can
actually look in real time

739
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,080
the performance of the agent.

740
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,940
You can look at the token usage,

741
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,240
you can look at the error
rate of the agents, et cetera.

742
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,950
Now to be able to do all this,

743
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,260
there are two key data flows

744
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,170
that we look at from different providers.

745
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,660
The first data flow is metadata.

746
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,730
What is metadata for an agent?

747
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,280
It's attributes like name of the agent,

748
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,290
the tools used by the agent,

749
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,570
the guardrails used by the agent.

750
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,430
And then there are vendor
specific attributes.

751
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,100
So if you're using AWS Bedrock agents,

752
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,880
there are attributes like
aliases, versioning, et cetera.

753
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,060
Similarly, the actions that
you can perform on the agent,

754
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,690
like you can start an
agent, stop an agent.

755
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,810
These are the metadata attributes
that we actually pick up.

756
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,580
The next is the log data.

757
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,100
We get the log data
from multiple providers.

758
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,660
In AWS Bedrock's case,

759
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,853
we get it from essentially CloudWatch

760
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:34,800
that the customer gives permission

761
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,320
to when they connect
the Boomi Control Tower

762
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,210
to their AWS account.

763
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,640
And we get the log coming into Boomi.

764
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,280
We process the log, analyze the log,

765
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,820
get insights out of the log
to do anomaly detection.

766
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,680
And how we do that will kind of unpeel

767
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,450
that in the next few slides.

768
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,510
We support both push and pull mechanism

769
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,350
for moving log and metadata
between the provider

770
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,750
as well as the Boomi Agent Control Tower.

771
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,850
The Control Tower also supports agents

772
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,970
coming from multiple regions
at this point of time.

773
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,760
Now we not only support ACE, MCP,

774
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,773
and A2A within the Boomi A,

775
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,390
we are also now part of
the agency consortium

776
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,030
that started by Cisco and LangChain

777
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,580
on actively contributing to the evolution

778
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,730
of MCP and A2A protocols.

779
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,270
All the systems within Boomi
are open telemetry compliant,

780
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,100
so you can essentially comply

781
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,420
and hook into any of
your old tel compliant

782
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,410
observability platforms into Boomi

783
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,633
that you use for your respective agents.

784
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,993
Now because we are in
a re:Invent conference,

785
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,480
I want to kind of give a bird's eye view

786
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,880
of the entire Boomi technology stack,

787
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,880
which includes the code
platform and the runtime,

788
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,980
the code platform between integration

789
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,890
and automation data
management. API management

790
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,170
includes building blocks like integration,

791
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,170
flow hub and API, all of
which runs on AWS stack

792
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:03,030
for more than two decades right now.

793
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,650
And the Agent Studio block,

794
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,230
which includes the agent designer,

795
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,030
the agent orchestrator,

796
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,500
and the Agent Control Tower

797
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,530
are all based on foundational
Bedrock elements.

798
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,840
We use foundational models for Bedrock.

799
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,630
We selectively pick up
services like guardrails,

800
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,880
semantic reasoning, et cetera.

801
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,980
We are also tightly well integrated

802
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,630
into Amazon Quick Suite
as well as Q Business.

803
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,268
The entire engineering
team at Boomi uses AWSQ

804
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,101
as an AI coding assistant

805
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,980
for a lot of our software development.

806
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,480
The beauty with the Boomi platform

807
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,780
is that you can design all
your integrations in the cloud

808
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,570
and you deploy your
integrations into your runtime,

809
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,100
which is a hybrid model.

810
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,010
So if you are having your own AWS VPC

811
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,570
where your systems work,

812
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,301
the runtime runs within your VPC

813
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,420
and not within your Boomi
cloud public environment.

814
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,060
Meaning when you move information
between Salesforce and ERP

815
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:00,780
or between your HR system and ERP,

816
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,210
it runs within your local parameter,

817
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,300
whether it's your AWS BPC
or any other cloud provider

818
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:09,570
or any other data center of your choice.

819
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,400
So that's the flexibility we offer

820
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,800
in the hybrid architecture for customers,

821
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,720
which gives them the possibility

822
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,600
to in future support, bring your own LLMs,

823
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,070
bring your own knowledge basis

824
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,580
and such capability as we
deploy agents into our runtime.

825
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,590
But this is kind of a bird's eye view

826
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,880
of the entire Boomi stack
running on AWS foundation.

827
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,040
There are a number of other
services I couldn't show

828
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,270
in the chart like ECS, EKS, Fargate

829
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,670
and a number of other AWS building stock

830
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,220
that we use to scale
and operate our systems

831
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,953
at four nines of availability
at this point of time.

832
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,150
Now, the one thing I
want to highlight is that

833
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,950
the Boomi Agent Control Tower

834
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,140
is a single governance platform,

835
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,340
a control plane to govern
and manage agents and tools,

836
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,780
not just from Boomi,

837
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,910
not just from AWS Bedrock,

838
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,660
but from 30 other providers
including Salesforce,

839
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,040
including LangChain,

840
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,680
including LandGraph, including Crew AI,

841
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,780
and a number of other
open source frameworks.

842
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,760
So anything that you think of it,

843
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,560
we support it at this point of time.

844
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,350
In fact, I have a slide that
I'll get into sometime later

845
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,050
that gives you the entire
gamut of the kind of agents

846
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,490
and tools that we support within

847
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,800
the Agent Control Tower for governance

848
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,510
at this point of time.

849
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,280
So let me unpeel the architecture

850
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,410
and go into another layer deep

851
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,010
in terms of how do we
synchronize metadata.

852
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,429
Metadata meaning attributes
like name of the agent,

853
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,620
the tools used in the agent,

854
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,000
the guardrails in an agent,

855
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,490
the version, the aliases for AWS specific

856
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,440
Bedrock agents, et cetera.

857
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,590
Now on the left hand side,

858
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,270
on the chart on the right here,

859
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,820
you have your AWS Bedrock environment

860
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,160
where you're running your
Bedrock native agents.

861
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,820
Now we essentially use
the Amazon EventBridge

862
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,224
based on the connection that
is set up with your AWS account

863
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,590
and the Boomi Control Tower,

864
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,160
pull the eventing mechanism
that is there for Bedrock

865
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,040
to get all the metadata

866
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,270
in a periodic basis when it's changed

867
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,650
in a pull or push mechanism.

868
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,240
We have support for both.

869
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,143
That information is collected into

870
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:18,810
the Boomi Agent Control
Tower, or a CT as we call it,

871
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,030
which is built on AWS Fargate.

872
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,030
And in the Control Tower
we process the metadata

873
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,030
and persisted in Aurora DB

874
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,450
with significant
replication provided to it.

875
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,110
When there is an anomaly
observed in a Bedrock agent

876
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,290
from the observability
data that we collected,

877
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,360
if we need to stop that agent,

878
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,950
you essentially invoke the stock command

879
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:44,100
from the Boomi Agent Control Tower,

880
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,140
and through SQS Lambda
function passes the command

881
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:50,610
to your Bedrock agent
running in your AWS VPC

882
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,608
to stop the agent at that point of time,

883
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:55,800
and it gets real time
feedback to the system.

884
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,990
So this is kinda how
we can have seamlessly

885
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,670
integrated this together

886
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,830
so that you don't have
to do any of the work.

887
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,960
We have been working with the AWS product

888
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,230
and engineering teams
for close to a year now

889
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,480
to have cloud formation
templates underneath the surface

890
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,110
to facilitate this integration
in a very seamless manner.

891
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,180
The next is log ingestion.

892
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,870
The second flow I talked about
after metadata was log flow.

893
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,980
We have a similar manner

894
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,300
by which once you hook your AWS account

895
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:25,103
with your Boomi Agent Control Tower,

896
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:27,210
you are able to expose
your CloudWatch logs.

897
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,610
Once you've given permission
to Boomi to access it,

898
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,681
it comes through a fire hose

899
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,180
into the Boomi Agent Control Tower

900
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,810
and the Control Tower persisted
in Amazon time-series DB

901
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,080
so that you can go query
the data, analyze the data,

902
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,020
look for anomalies within
the log, et cetera,

903
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,269
and show that in the dashboard.

904
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,310
I'll show that in a demo, but
this is the other log flow,

905
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,950
which also happens in a synchronous

906
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,470
but near real time basis
between the two agents

907
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,070
so that you can get the
logs in a continuous manner.

908
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,520
The third flow is how
do we onboard providers

909
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,230
into the Boomi Agent Control Tower?

910
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,470
I told you you have support
for about 30 plus providers.

911
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,050
We classify providers as two categories.

912
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,220
One is the SaaS vendors like AWS Bedrock,

913
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,530
Salesforce, Microsoft Copilot.

914
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,640
We essentially have a native
onboarding already integrated

915
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,587
with these providers

916
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,300
so that the moment you hook
the two accounts together,

917
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,670
information seamlessly passes in.

918
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,790
In AWS Bedrock keys, we have
a cloud formation template

919
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,080
that is well defined

920
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,650
that ensures that information
from Bedrock metadata

921
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,630
log data are all passed.

922
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,520
And also the agent catalog is passed

923
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,020
to the Boomi Control Tower

924
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,537
so that you can discover it,

925
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:40,680
govern it, watch it.

926
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,620
When we go to the specific frameworks

927
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,100
like LandGraph or Crew
AI or other frameworks,

928
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,390
we essentially have an onboarding
SDK and an API available

929
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,940
by which you can onboard
all these different agents

930
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,153
from these different providers
into the Agent Control Tower.

931
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,720
Then next is the sync action.

932
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,920
Now how do you synchronize

933
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,979
and metadata between the
two multiple providers

934
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:08,100
and Boomi Control Tower?

935
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,900
We have two patterns here.

936
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,100
The first pattern is the
pull via pull via API

937
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,960
as well as asynchronous push.

938
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,400
We support this for frameworks
like Amazon Bedrock,

939
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,500
Salesforce, Microsoft Copilot,

940
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,300
and a number of other vendors.

941
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,050
We also have an SDK with
shrink-push API capability

942
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,770
for the custom providers
like Crew AI and LangChain

943
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,660
through which you can synchronize actions

944
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,433
between these different systems.

945
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,830
The last is reporting.

946
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,050
Once we get a lot of the logs,

947
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,540
the logs are processed, analyzed,

948
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,850
analytics are built in the Control Tower

949
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,740
and everything is exposed as APIs.

950
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,390
So that if you want to essentially

951
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,360
hook those APIs back to
your internal dashboard,

952
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,520
you have the ability to call
into those APIs from the

953
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,980
Boomi Agent Control Tower.

954
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,860
So this gives you a high
level handshake mechanism

955
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,360
for a few core things.

956
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,160
How do you onboard providers?

957
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,230
How do you exchange metadata?

958
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,360
How do you exchange log data?

959
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,910
How do you execute actions

960
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,380
from Boomi Control Tower

961
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,240
onto your respective agent providers?

962
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,360
And finally, how do you
get the reporting access?

963
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,680
So we did a lot of talking,

964
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,790
now let's actually see the
Agent Control Tower in action.

965
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,890
So we have an anomaly that's created

966
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,900
in a customer success agent.

967
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,190
The agent is hallucinating

968
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,420
and it's logging out users

969
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,760
when he logs in from multiple devices.

970
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,950
So that's the problem that it has.

971
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,570
So let's see what happens.

972
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,390
The user goes into Boomi's platform page.

973
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,630
You essentially bring up
the Agent Control Tower.

974
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,210
The moment you invoke
the Agent Control Tower,

975
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,640
you see the whole portfolio of agents.

976
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,580
There are agents from Bedrock, Boomi,

977
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,220
Salesforce, ServiceNow, IBM.

978
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,140
When you click on the
anomaly detector tool,

979
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,210
it shows a bunch of anomalies.

980
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,770
So we have one particular anomaly

981
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,960
where there's an increase in token size.

982
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,370
When you look at the anomaly,

983
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,260
we see that the token size exceeds

984
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,330
the current threshold of 300.

985
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,750
The Control Tower automatically
gives recommendations

986
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,820
to adjust the model parameters.

987
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,790
The user looks at it,
reviews it, approves it,

988
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,470
and it's set in action.

989
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,600
Now let's look at one of
the most popular agents,

990
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,820
which is like a Bedrock agent.

991
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,050
Let's click on the agent

992
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,540
and see what's happening
in that particular agent.

993
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,550
We can essentially go into the error panel

994
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,670
and in the panel you can
essentially see invocations,

995
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,500
you can see the token usage,

996
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
you can see a list of errors

997
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,320
and there's a spike in errors

998
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,860
and there's basically an error
with a Salesforce agent here.

999
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,650
So when you click on
that Salesforce agent,

1000
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,180
you can look at the entire tools,

1001
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,610
the guardrails for that Salesforce agent,

1002
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,460
and you may want to disable
that agent temporarily

1003
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,140
to prevent any other disruption
to your business process,

1004
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,146
which you can do.

1005
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:49,979
So what you saw in this video

1006
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:52,830
was a Bedrock agent calling
into a Salesforce agent,

1007
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,370
all governed through the
Boomi Agent Control Tower

1008
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,920
by going across multiple
providers essentially

1009
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,590
seamlessly through all
the different mechanisms

1010
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,720
that I just spoke to you
about the architecture,

1011
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,070
in the few slides.

1012
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,540
I have one more demo to you

1013
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,360
that actually shows you
how you can build agents

1014
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,400
with the Boomi agent designer.

1015
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,230
It's a low-code, no-code utility

1016
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,400
where you can go in,

1017
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,810
you can give instructions,

1018
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,550
you can provide tasks

1019
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,500
for the agents as part of the task,

1020
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,230
you can essentially look
at a series of tools

1021
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,940
that you can add into the task here.

1022
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,850
You want to essentially set
the price for the product,

1023
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,950
you include that into your list.

1024
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,260
You then essentially
look at the guardrails

1025
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,120
that are available for the agent.

1026
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,890
It gives you a list of guardrails,

1027
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,840
attributes and the respective actions.

1028
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,720
It also has a demo wizard

1029
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,400
where you can actually test the agent

1030
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,920
in a sandbox environment in the designer.

1031
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,550
You can deploy the agent into
the production environment

1032
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,110
or the appropriate environment.

1033
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,360
You can then go into the Control Tower.

1034
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,060
You can actually click
into one of your providers.

1035
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,400
You can look at all the different agents

1036
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,410
that are available in the Control Tower

1037
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,520
from different providers.

1038
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,560
The color code indicates
different providers,

1039
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,880
not just Boomi.

1040
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,330
You can look at one specific agent.

1041
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,710
You can look at the attributes

1042
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,780
of that particular agent, essentially.

1043
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,170
Look at all the different
tools that the agent has.

1044
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,210
You can even go and add new tools

1045
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,030
like the hub gen agent
to it as an example.

1046
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,950
And then you can look
at the monitoring plane.

1047
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,590
The monitoring plane is where
all the log data is collected

1048
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,440
to look at your token usage, dashboard,

1049
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,567
look at errors and all that.

1050
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:30,330
So this is a whole rich set of
functionality that is offered

1051
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,266
and we are continuing to add
more and more new features

1052
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,030
into the Boomi Agent Control Tower.

1053
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,820
So again, the key thing
here to take away is that

1054
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,400
the Control Tower has support for

1055
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,890
agents coming from multiple providers,

1056
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,420
tools from multiple providers

1057
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,140
that you can interact with,
govern with, control and manage

1058
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,270
and make sure that your business process

1059
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,103
executes in a seamless manner.

1060
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,500
I'm gonna skip this slide,

1061
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,710
but let's look at what a few
customers are talking about it.

1062
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,540
Like Jade Global for example,

1063
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,090
we're able to create 20 agents

1064
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,970
across different systems like finance,

1065
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,030
customer support, customer
success, et cetera,

1066
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,790
and deploy these agents into production.

1067
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,370
And they were able to save about 65%

1068
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,050
of their development time,

1069
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,240
6I9, which is another company

1070
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,340
which is able to essentially use

1071
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,380
the Boomi Agent Control Tower

1072
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,250
to essentially govern
across multiple AI projects

1073
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,470
that are happening across the enterprise.

1074
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,270
So these are some examples

1075
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,450
by which companies are
using the Boomi Agent Studio

1076
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,820
and the Control Tower

1077
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,160
to get governance across multiple agents

1078
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
and tools coming from multiple providers

1079
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,360
in the industry at this point of time.

1080
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,223
All this in production at this point.

1081
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,500
Now I told you I will share

1082
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,570
the list of providers we support.

1083
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,210
These are all the list of agent providers

1084
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,140
that the Agent Control Tower
today supports in production.

1085
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,760
We have Amazon Bedrock.

1086
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,340
We have agents from Llama, from Meta,

1087
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,430
Salesforce, we have Crew AI,

1088
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,650
we have LandGraph, LangChain, name it,

1089
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,170
all the top popular providers are there.

1090
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,870
We are constantly enhancing this list

1091
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,360
to add more and more
providers and capabilities

1092
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,010
into the Agent Control Tower

1093
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,880
so that you can get control
over the sprawl of agents

1094
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,790
and manage them much more
effectively and efficiently

1095
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,293
within the organization.

1096
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,690
Now in summary, I wanted to leave you

1097
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,040
with a few core thoughts.

1098
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,470
Our core goal with Agent Control Tower

1099
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,660
is to provide scalable AI governance.

1100
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,820
Chris had earlier talked about integration

1101
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,990
being one of the barriers

1102
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,600
of taking agentic workloads to production.

1103
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,850
We are trying to address
and solve the problems

1104
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,720
because integration has been
within the DNA of Boomi.

1105
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,490
We've been in the integration space.

1106
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,210
AI agents and agentic
workloads are next new pattern

1107
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,190
and paradigm of integration workloads

1108
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,110
that's coming into the ecosystem

1109
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,300
and we are embracing it right up front

1110
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,130
and that's how we have 60,000 agents

1111
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,260
in production across different systems.

1112
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,570
We give you enhanced visibility.

1113
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,580
We work with all the different providers

1114
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,229
to make sure that the integrations

1115
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:06,420
with the providers like Bedrock,

1116
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,190
like Salesforce,

1117
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,710
like Microsoft Copilot,

1118
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,540
are seamlessly integrated.

1119
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,150
We are also working with
other open source providers

1120
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,483
like Crew AI and LangChain

1121
00:45:17,483 --> 00:45:19,650
to make sure that it's
closely well integrated.

1122
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,480
In fact, with the AWS Bedrock team,

1123
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,570
I remember we started this
collaboration about a year ago

1124
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,570
where they expose specific
attributes on CloudWatch.

1125
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,600
They added poss and play
actions to their agents

1126
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,130
so that we could essentially govern it

1127
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,750
from the Agent Control Tower.

1128
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,910
So that's in summary the core capability

1129
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,110
that we provide.

1130
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,510
There's more information
that's available on the booth.

1131
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,040
Chris, any points you want to add?

1132
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,873
- I did.

1133
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:44,550
I want to, when you're
looking at the problem,

1134
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,990
there's two parts of the problem.

1135
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,990
We just finished a huge study of CIOs

1136
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,697
of people that are actually
actively using our system

1137
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:53,010
and we interviewed them all.

1138
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,461
What are your top,

1139
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,100
and the top three issues
they came back with.

1140
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,602
Number one was the difficulty
in understanding the ROI

1141
00:45:59,602 --> 00:46:00,900
and the cost of agents to make
sure that that was balanced.

1142
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,300
Like what's gonna be the
benefit, risk reduction,

1143
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,790
increase in revenue or increase in profit

1144
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,680
that I'm gonna get from doing
this balance for the cost

1145
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,833
of actually the LLM invocations,
which can be tricky.

1146
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,220
You know, we see anything
from two cents to $9

1147
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,370
to be honest in our
own production systems.

1148
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,900
Hard dollar cost.

1149
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,960
All the way up to number
two, data quality.

1150
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,850
How can I actually fix
the data quality issue

1151
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,990
going in to do that?

1152
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,397
Talks a lot about our data hub product,

1153
00:46:27,397 --> 00:46:29,793
which is how I could do
master data cleansing.

1154
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:30,791
Doesn't have to be master data,

1155
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,610
but how do I actually take
core data concepts that I have

1156
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,667
and how do I use both rule-based

1157
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,030
and agentic based systems to cleanse those

1158
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,350
and create a store

1159
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,630
or else how do I actually take my corpus

1160
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,270
of documents automatically put those into,

1161
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,440
into a vector database

1162
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,397
even based on different
document type and others

1163
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:47,280
which we're about to release

1164
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
without having to have a special engineer

1165
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,930
who understands all the different issues

1166
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,930
with overlapping and token
size and all the other issues.

1167
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,040
And the third issue beyond that

1168
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,700
was actually the aspect

1169
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,150
of these enterprise class
features of governance.

1170
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,880
Now I'm hearing this from
all the top analysts.

1171
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,310
They were all telling
me agent sprawl is now

1172
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,260
the number two issue after ROI.

1173
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,650
We heard it in our own study
that these are coming out.

1174
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,050
And I just wanna put this
in your mind for a second,

1175
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:16,883
I'm gonna get to it.

1176
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:18,153
It's the same issue.

1177
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,420
Your companies are making,

1178
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,550
starting to make decision about AI

1179
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,230
and agentic integration for
these business processes.

1180
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,640
Many companies now believe,

1181
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,560
and if you read whether it's,

1182
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,140
you know host of different
analysts are all saying,

1183
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,540
within a few years many
of the SaaS providers

1184
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,680
will be not doing well.

1185
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,930
Your companies will be
disinvesting from those

1186
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,710
and be replacing those with
agentic conversational UIs

1187
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,460
that work with the different users.

1188
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,820
That means your business process

1189
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,440
was taken out of the application.

1190
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,990
The codification of
that has now moved down

1191
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,150
into an agentic layer

1192
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,000
that includes APIs, web service calls,

1193
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,540
database calls, vector
database calls and others.

1194
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,080
That data flowing through
sometimes doing MCP hops,

1195
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,990
going through deterministic
logic if then else

1196
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,363
and doing probabilistic altogether.

1197
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,240
How are you possibly going
to be in a governed state

1198
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,688
to make sure that you don't have secure,

1199
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,320
somebody hasn't done a prompt
injection and jumped in?

1200
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,970
I don't have hallucinations.

1201
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,890
If you don't have one system

1202
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,350
that can see all the requests out

1203
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,470
and all the flows back
in through to the agent,

1204
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,840
so then, and then having
something like anomaly detection,

1205
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,040
looking for variations

1206
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,480
and needles in the haystack

1207
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,700
to call attention to those problems.

1208
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,170
When the auditor comes calling,

1209
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,870
are you gonna go out to
12 different platforms

1210
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,700
and start pulling up logs

1211
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,890
and trying to stitch those together,

1212
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,020
not only with the calls
out but the reasonings

1213
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,910
of the different agents
from the different vendors

1214
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,888
altogether to show them

1215
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,047
how you have complete

1216
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:52,853
immutable audit trails across everything.

1217
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,430
That's what we do today in Boomi.

1218
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,280
We already do it and
we do it in production.

1219
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,960
It's not dream wear, it's not this.

1220
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,860
I talked about it.

1221
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,400
We have 12,000 of them
in production today.

1222
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,233
Okay?

1223
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,060
We've been doing this for a while.

1224
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,340
We have 50,000 in place in our own system

1225
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,200
over the last two years
of people doing it.

1226
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,610
We use it in Boomi today.

1227
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,050
That's what we're talking about.

1228
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,700
This isn't coding it together

1229
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,900
with a bunch of different systems

1230
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,160
and praying that it works or not,

1231
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,840
that you're not here
when the auditors come.

1232
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,150
So I'm getting a platform
that'll enable you guys

1233
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,930
to then innovate at speed

1234
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,750
and actually get that higher
OI from your investments.

1235
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,070
So that was the comments I wanted.

1236
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:32,970
- No, thank you Chris.

1237
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,950
And again, if you want more information

1238
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,510
you can join us at a booth.

1239
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,880
It's booth number 1075.

1240
