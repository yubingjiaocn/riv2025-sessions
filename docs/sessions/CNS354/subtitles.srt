1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,369
Alright folks, hello and

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,019
welcome.

3
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:05,650
Uh, today we're gonna be talking about Amazon

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,969
EKS auto mode.

5
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:09,728
I know a lot of you are probably familiar

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,509
with reinvent sessions where

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,890
they spend 45 minutes telling you how great something

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,148
is and then 5 minutes

9
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:16,519
showing you how it works.

10
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,929
We're gonna flip the script a little bit and we'll start

11
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,109
with the demo showing you what's possible

12
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,809
with Amazon EKS auto mode.

13
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,600
My name is Cy Venom. I'm a principal solutions

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,190
architect at AWS.

15
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,289
I'm joined by Alex Kessner,

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,228
who's the principal product manager,

17
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,719
uh, and the lead PM for Amazon EKS

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,810
Auto mode, and we also have a guest

19
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,069
who'll join us on stage here

20
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,450
in a little bit, uh, from Capital One

21
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,469
as well. So

22
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,770
stay tuned for that, folks. And like

23
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,209
I said, I do wanna go ahead and

24
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,630
start with a demo. I wanna show you folks

25
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,950
what's actually

26
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:51,649
possible with Amazon EKS

27
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:52,209
Auto mode.

28
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,298
And we're gonna start here with our familiar

29
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,319
Amazon EKS dashboard, but

30
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,359
don't worry folks, we're gonna go to the terminal here pretty soon.

31
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,439
I just wanna show you what we're starting

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,560
with. We're gonna make this just a little

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,838
bit bigger first. Uh, we're gonna go

34
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:06,909
to clusters.

35
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,659
I have a cluster that I created not too long ago,

36
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,719
um, just to show you folks,

37
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,379
there's nothing in the cluster right now. It's completely empty,

38
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,579
so 0 pods, 0 nodes.

39
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,168
But I promise you it's production ready

40
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:21,549
and I think the interesting thing

41
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,989
about this is that, uh, you know, generally

42
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,689
with any sort of EKS cluster,

43
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,980
uh, when you run get pods and

44
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,989
all name spaces you expect to see some things

45
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,900
in there, anything for,

46
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,588
you know, things like pod to pod networking, maybe

47
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:34,448
coup proxy,

48
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,290
maybe the CNI, the container networking interface,

49
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,028
but with an auto mode cluster

50
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,430
you're gonna see nothing in there but I promise

51
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,870
you it is production ready.

52
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,349
And I think the first hint

53
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,290
for knowing

54
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,448
whether it's production ready is

55
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,790
uh by looking at the custom resource

56
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,469
definitions in the cluster.

57
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,019
And here's kind of that hint of

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,058
you'll see things in here for

59
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,400
like node claims and node pools

60
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,689
that's the underlying open source carpenter

61
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,278
project that

62
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,620
gives us dynamic node auto scaling.

63
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,760
You'll see some indication here that we can

64
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,088
create ingresses and load balancers.

65
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,338
Essentially our cluster

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,719
has these components managed in the

67
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,419
control plane

68
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,960
to enable it to be ready to serve

69
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,919
real workloads.

70
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,528
But they're not running in our data plan,

71
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,038
so no nodes,

72
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,490
no pods, nothing that we're responsible

73
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,649
for, nothing that we're paying for, and most

74
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,729
importantly, nothing that we need to manage when it comes

75
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,368
to things like cluster upgrades.

76
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:33,929
Let's do something a bit more interesting. I'm gonna

77
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,129
clear this out and then in the bottom

78
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,330
terminal load up EKS node

79
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,449
viewer. This is just a tool to let me see

80
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,528
what nodes are in my cluster again, no

81
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,050
nodes and over here I wanna apply a very

82
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,389
simple retail,

83
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,229
uh, store sample application.

84
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,379
And just the UI component

85
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,719
and you know there's no nodes, right,

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,038
but in just a matter of a few seconds you saw

87
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,270
Carpenter pick it up and we saw

88
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,278
that it picked a C6A

89
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,330
large instance

90
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,979
um it's not ready yet it's

91
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:05,038
starting the node any second now it's

92
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,110
at 16 seconds, 17 seconds you can

93
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,000
see on the bottom right

94
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,288
no started

95
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,179
networked into our Kubernetes cluster.

96
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:13,919
It picked a C6A large as you can see,

97
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,058
and we have one pod still pending

98
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:18,069
to start but scheduled on that note, right?

99
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:20,338
In the second here it should switch to

100
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:21,879
running boom, there we go.

101
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
Uh, let's do something a bit more interesting. We're gonna

102
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,788
scale this deployment up to 10 replicas

103
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,219
now. I don't think all 10 replicas are gonna

104
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,258
fit in that first node. Nope, see,

105
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
so it fits 3 in that first node.

106
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,330
And then to fit the remaining 7 it's

107
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,490
gonna spin up a C6AX large.

108
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,969
By the way folks, it's deciding the nodes for

109
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:41,750
me. I didn't

110
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:44,050
script this ahead of time. I didn't tell it what to do.

111
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,088
It's gonna pick the right node for the right set

112
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:46,808
of workloads.

113
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,110
Boom, there we go. The node is ready.

114
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,750
The pods are scheduled,

115
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,088
and in a few seconds here we should see them

116
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:55,210
all flip to running. So there you go. You can see a 10

117
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,710
running. Bound on the two nodes

118
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:00,050
and the the deployment scaled

119
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,050
up by the way, it's also

120
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,409
working on spinning up an application load bouncer

121
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,449
for me, but that takes a couple of minutes and I'm

122
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,569
trying to show you the full demo in 5 minutes.

123
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,770
So let's clear this out

124
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,069
and poured forward,

125
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,508
uh, the service that we've created here.

126
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,149
And then

127
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,899
once that's ready, switch to a browser.

128
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,790
Here we go and we'll go to local host

129
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,649
8080

130
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,230
and there we go. This is our retail

131
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,410
store sample application.

132
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,588
Pretty basic. Just,

133
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:31,170
uh, front end UI application. We

134
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,209
did scale it 10 times and so

135
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,350
you saw with the fresh

136
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,809
EKS auto mode cluster we're

137
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,649
able to start serving traffic.

138
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,970
We were able to dynamically scale the nodes

139
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,069
where the workloads work

140
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,410
in a matter of minutes and I think

141
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,559
that's really the idea here, uh,

142
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:47,899
is we wanna show you

143
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,350
the, the rapid pace of,

144
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,649
uh, how quickly you can start getting workloads going.

145
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,259
So that's my quick 5 minute demo.

146
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:57,309
I have a deeper dive demo coming here

147
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:58,028
in a little bit.

148
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,540
This was the what of how things

149
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,108
work, but for us to start understanding

150
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:03,928
the why,

151
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,869
I wanna pass it to Alex, our

152
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,028
lead PM on EKS auto mode. He's gonna

153
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,048
talk a little bit about how we

154
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,209
got here. Take us back to the beginning.

155
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:14,949
Off to you, Alex. Awesome, thanks.

156
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,548
Thanks everyone for joining us today. Really excited

157
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:18,410
to be with you.

158
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,910
Um, you know, I think that,

159
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,209
uh. It's so exciting

160
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,449
to see how quickly you can get started

161
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,048
up and running with EKS Autoode today, but it's also

162
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,209
important to understand why customers choose

163
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,449
Kubernetes and how EKS evolved to get

164
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,369
where we are today with Auto mode.

165
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,178
Stepping back, Kubernetes was created

166
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,410
to help customers manage the increasing

167
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,250
complexity of the cloud.

168
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,259
Today it's the leading cloud operating model, and its popularity

169
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,369
is only increasing.

170
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,738
In 2024, 93%

171
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:50,178
of organizations, up from 84%

172
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:52,199
last year, surveyed by the Cloud Native Computing

173
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,250
Foundation, are either using Kubernetes

174
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,738
in production or actively evaluating it for their

175
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,809
organization. Without a doubt, Kubernetes is the de

176
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,600
facto standard for operating in the cloud.

177
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,230
This is because Kubernetes is incredibly

178
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,809
useful.

179
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,428
It has a relatively simple set of APIs

180
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,509
for managing large groups of servers and

181
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,528
coordinating how your applications run across them.

182
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,069
Because it was both born in the era and

183
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,548
from the complexities of the cloud, it also prioritized

184
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,230
consistency.

185
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,750
After all, what good is Simplicity if there's

186
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,298
different versions of Simple for different

187
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,548
applications, let alone all the different places your

188
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:25,369
applications need to run.

189
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:28,309
And while Kubernetes itself covers the vast

190
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,350
majority of the functionality that you

191
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,608
need to build, deploy, scale,

192
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,139
and operate any kind of exciting new

193
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,108
application you can think of,

194
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,588
it's also extensible, which makes it incredibly

195
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:39,189
powerful.

196
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,548
There are currently 195

197
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,730
open source projects managed under the Cloud Native Computing

198
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,988
Foundation and hundreds more landscape

199
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,178
projects which run on, integrate with, or

200
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:50,269
extend Kubernetes. You can even write

201
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,480
your own. OK, so Kubernetes

202
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,588
is great. I think you all know that, that's why you're

203
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:56,769
here. Actually, using Kubernetes is great,

204
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,639
but running and operating Kuberne's clusters

205
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,548
can be quite hard.

206
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,189
So this is why 8 years ago, right

207
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,230
here at Reinvent In Fact in 2017, we

208
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,759
launched Amazon EKS.

209
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,399
This was in response to feedback we got from customers

210
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,629
that managing Kubernetes at scale was hard.

211
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,519
They had to monitor, scale and manage the Kubernetes

212
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,559
control plane to meet their requirements for security

213
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,338
and resiliency.

214
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,928
Let alone find ways to integrate their clusters with

215
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:22,278
other AWS services that their applications needed.

216
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,809
Since then, Amazon EKS has emerged

217
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:27,470
as the most trusted way to run Kubernetes,

218
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,689
offloading the undifferentiated heavy lifting

219
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,410
of hosting the Kubernetes control plane to AWS

220
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,678
while remaining fully Kubernetes conformant.

221
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,309
This allows customers to focus on how

222
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:39,369
to run on running their applications instead of

223
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,928
managing their cluster's control plane.

224
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,559
And we didn't stop there.

225
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,379
Over the last 8 years, we've been consistently

226
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,629
busy delivering new features and enhancements

227
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,858
for not only EKS, the AWS service,

228
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,238
but also the broader Kubernetes open source community.

229
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,889
We started with this basic managed control

230
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,298
plane and have steadily added capabilities

231
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:59,298
for compute management, auxiliary software,

232
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,899
security, scalability, networking, observability,

233
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,579
troubleshooting, and even recently this year, EKS

234
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,899
capabilities itself, a new launch that you should

235
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,720
certainly check out as it's very exciting for

236
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:11,619
managing operational software on top of the cluster.

237
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,230
With more than 250 launches over the last

238
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,528
7-8 years,

239
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,028
from expanding into additional AWB regions,

240
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,199
reducing pricing, introducing open source

241
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,949
projects, etc.

242
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,548
we've been very busy. We've even created

243
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,649
brand new open source projects like Carpenter that powers

244
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,088
Auto mode, Crow, and ACK that have become

245
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:29,819
industry standards.

246
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,629
We've gone deep into operating into every

247
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:35,308
aspect of operating Kubernetes in

248
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,389
what we think might be the largest scale

249
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,440
anywhere. Which is why we

250
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,879
now run 10s of millions of clusters for customers

251
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,538
every year, and this keeps growing.

252
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,349
But when we spoke with some of our customers running

253
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,379
these tens of millions of clusters, they told

254
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:50,500
us that while EKS made managing clusters

255
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,509
easier, there was still more that we could do

256
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,820
to make deploying and operating Kuberna's

257
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:55,489
applications easier,

258
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,489
which is why last year at Reinvent.

259
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,889
We launched EKS Auto mode. Um,

260
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,710
Auto mode is not only a major evolution

261
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,908
for easily running, production ready Kubernetes

262
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,989
clusters, it fulfills our vision of how

263
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,219
we think Kubernete should operate in the cloud.

264
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,750
AutoMode provides Kubernete's conformant

265
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,509
and AWS managed compute,

266
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:15,989
networking and storage for any new or

267
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,408
existing EKS cluster.

268
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:20,019
This makes it easier for you to leverage the

269
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,178
security, availability, scalability

270
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,048
and operational excellence of AWS

271
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,710
for your Kubernetes applications.

272
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,029
Auto mode allows you to create application ready clusters

273
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,109
like the one that you just saw from Psy at the beginning of this

274
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:32,928
talk, uh,

275
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,788
preconfigured with the essential capabilities and

276
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,899
best practices from our 7 years, 8 years,

277
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:38,469
excuse me,

278
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,928
um, of running tens of millions of clusters.

279
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:43,428
Dynamically scales and cost optimizes

280
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:46,058
cluster compute based on your application's needs.

281
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,269
It selects provisions, secures,

282
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:50,649
and upgrades AWS managed EC2

283
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,779
instances within your account using AWS

284
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,869
controlled access and life life cycle

285
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,928
management. And it handles operating

286
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,759
system patches, health monitoring,

287
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:01,200
updates, and limits security risks with ephemeral

288
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,489
compute, strengthening your strengthening your

289
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:04,788
security posture by default.

290
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:08,178
Autoode also meaningfully simplifies cluster

291
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:08,849
upgrades,

292
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:11,369
reducing the operational overhead of running

293
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,538
Kubernete's clusters, enabling you to

294
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,690
focus on the activities that are critical to your business

295
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,119
instead of maintaining infrastructure.

296
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,548
All of these features help reduce the time

297
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,668
it takes to launch new applications and allows

298
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:25,359
your organization to get new products or modernized

299
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,649
applications to market faster.

300
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:29,229
Because Automotive Kubernetes conformant, it

301
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,229
means you're able to do so while continuing to take advantage of

302
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,349
that vast ecosystem of open source

303
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,509
tools and software.

304
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,759
Auto mode helps improve your application's availability

305
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,379
as well

306
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,719
by managing the infrastructure

307
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,849
where your applications are running,

308
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,080
you're better able to meet the needs of your users

309
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,099
and organization.

310
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,019
Finally,

311
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
it does all of this while automatically

312
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,700
optimizing for cost efficiency both of the compute

313
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,158
and your team's time.

314
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:57,190
Reducing the operational overhead of running Kuberne's

315
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,298
applications enables you to focus on again

316
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:00,979
those things that are critical to your business,

317
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,629
so. I've talked a lot about the work

318
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,788
that it takes to manage

319
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,950
all of these Kubernes clusters and the infrastructure behind

320
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,190
them. Let's take a look at what that actually looked like

321
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,048
practically speaking,

322
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,229
before EKS Auto mode.

323
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,950
Customers had to provision a cluster, install

324
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,029
all the essential Kubernetes plug-ins required to

325
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,460
run production grade applications, select,

326
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,759
configure, and launch the best compute

327
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,190
for those applications, and finally

328
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,450
with those pieces in place,

329
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,469
they could finally deploy the applications into their cluster.

330
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,308
But this is just the beginning of actually running these

331
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,509
applications. With the applications deployed,

332
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,918
you now have to you have to continuously monitor all

333
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:39,119
of this infrastructure and software, repairing

334
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:41,058
it when unexpected issues inevitably arise,

335
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:43,639
and upgrading it as new Kubernetes versions

336
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,639
or operating system patches are released so

337
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,139
they can remain up to date, compliant and secure.

338
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,840
All of this was operational work that you had to take

339
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,538
on, which was reflected in the architecture

340
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,719
of a non-auto mode

341
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:56,279
cluster.

342
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,599
So let's come back and look at, see

343
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,440
what this looks like with EKS auto mode.

344
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:04,229
With just one click or API call, Auto

345
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:06,279
mode provides a fully automated AWS

346
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,178
managed Kuberras conformant compute,

347
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,840
storage and networking for any EKS cluster.

348
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,639
Once you've created a cluster with Auto mode enabled, there's

349
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,070
nothing else you need to do before you can begin deploying

350
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,029
applications like you saw from Psy.

351
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,158
Auto mode automatically provides the infrastructure

352
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:21,408
your applications need.

353
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,119
Uh, scales resources to meet your

354
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,229
application's changing demand,

355
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,759
automatically optimizes for cost, and monitors

356
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,259
and repairs nodes as needed.

357
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,840
All of this eliminates a ton of operational work

358
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,139
so that you and your teams can focus on building

359
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,359
applications that drive innovation.

360
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,320
So the other way you can think about this is what

361
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,359
is the architecture of a cluster look

362
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,779
like both without auto mode and with auto mode.

363
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,359
So here's what it looks like for a

364
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,158
cluster without auto mode. Um,

365
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,960
the classic AWS managed cluster

366
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,418
control plan is on the left in an AWS account,

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,658
and all of the other Kubernetes plug-ins, software,

368
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:59,229
infrastructure provision, and other AWS resources

369
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,519
that your applications need are on the right

370
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,460
in your account.

371
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,969
With auto mode,

372
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,469
this changes quite a bit.

373
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,808
You can see that not only does AWS run

374
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,969
the cluster control plan as we always have, we

375
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,450
also now run a set of essential and integrated

376
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,570
Kubernetes capabilities for compute, storage

377
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,460
and networking.

378
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,960
Straddling our and our customers' accounts,

379
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,158
Autoode also launches EC2 Managed

380
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:23,210
Instances, a new operating model for

381
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,288
EC2 shared by similar features

382
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,450
in ECS and Lambda, just announced even this

383
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,298
year. This allows you to delegate

384
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,690
operational responsibility for the instances themselves

385
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,710
to an AWS service like EKS with

386
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,750
auto mode while they continue to reside

387
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,830
in your account and function otherwise like

388
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,418
normal EC2 instances.

389
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:43,190
Other supporting infrastructure

390
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,548
resources like load balancers and EBS volumes

391
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:48,229
continue to exist in your account as they have

392
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,250
since EKS launched.

393
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,729
You know, one other way that we like to think about

394
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,808
how the balance of what

395
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,889
each of us is responsible for changes with

396
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,820
auto mode is with the shared responsibility model.

397
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,109
This shows what part of

398
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,570
an architecture is our responsibility and what

399
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,158
part a customer is responsible for.

400
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,288
With standard EKS clusters,

401
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,918
we're responsible for all of the

402
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:12,048
AWS global infrastructure, foundational services,

403
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:13,548
as well as the cluster control plane.

404
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,239
Well, everything above that in this diagram

405
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,320
from cluster capabilities to compute and

406
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
compute life cycle management, operating system

407
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,538
patching, monitoring, repairing,

408
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,918
all of these are fundamentally our

409
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,178
customers' responsibility.

410
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,719
While some of the 250+ features

411
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,798
we've launched over the last 8 years have helped make

412
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,460
managing parts of this easier,

413
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,849
they're ultimately in your

414
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:37,940
sphere of responsibility to manage.

415
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,639
With auto mode, we move this boundary of the

416
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,519
shared responsibility model considerably.

417
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,139
We take on far more of the undifferentiated

418
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,320
heavy lifting, including all cluster capabilities

419
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,219
for compute, storage and networking,

420
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,469
but also operating system patching, monitoring,

421
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,519
health, and repairing the EC2 instances

422
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,058
where applications actually run.

423
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,070
This lets you focus on your application, your

424
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,639
application security, how it's monitored,

425
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,158
how it's operating, and any other essential plug-ins

426
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:04,479
or add-ons that you might need.

427
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,869
This lets you focus on the things that are essential to your

428
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,099
business as opposed to managing infrastructure,

429
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,969
of course.

430
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,408
It's one thing for me to tell you about how

431
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:14,489
great Automotde is, but it's another to see it yourself,

432
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,808
which is why I wanna hand it back over to Cy to go

433
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:18,710
a little bit deeper in his next demo.

434
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,469
Alright, let's do it, folks.

435
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,048
Thanks for that,

436
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,629
Alex, and I, by the way, these last

437
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,908
two slides, I just like flipping back and forth

438
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,908
between them really fast, and then you can

439
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:31,950
see just how much we'll manage

440
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,979
for you with auto mode, right? I, I,

441
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,058
it's just, uh, something I like, but the operational

442
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:38,109
overhead that I couldn't offload was figuring out

443
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,000
how to do that in PowerPoint.

444
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,690
There you go. Uh,

445
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,950
that's why I'm here. That's why I'm here, Alex. Alright,

446
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,330
awesome. Well, it's time to flip into

447
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,649
a demo. Let's see auto mode in action, folks.

448
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,710
I gave you a quick 5 minute,

449
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,969
just very quick flow and

450
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,570
how all of this stuff works, but

451
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:55,629
how about

452
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,788
we jump back to where we were.

453
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:01,009
So essentially we had deployed the UI

454
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,710
application. We had scaled it up,

455
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:05,090
but I wanna do something a bit more

456
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,109
interesting. I don't think any

457
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,210
of you folks have seen any other speakers talk

458
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,190
about JN AI at this conference, right? No.

459
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,599
Well, let me be your first. Uh, we wanna show

460
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,038
you folks a real

461
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:19,259
meaty LLM model deployed

462
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,619
in EKS auto mode

463
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,418
from scratch on an Nvidia-based

464
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,700
instance. We wanna show how accelerated

465
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,859
compute and this kind of GPU

466
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:28,558
support comes

467
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
batteries included in an auto mode

468
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,058
cluster and hopefully.

469
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,629
It'll give you a good sense for

470
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:38,340
how much we're actually trying and helping

471
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,269
you manage on the operational side of the world.

472
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,808
So first I'm gonna downscale

473
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,038
these. So let's go ahead and

474
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,570
run a um scale command,

475
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,000
and I'll just take this deployment down to

476
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:52,658
0 replicas.

477
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,178
Uh, by the way, that autocomplete is courtesy

478
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:56,158
of Quiro CLI.

479
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,479
Check it out. Um, OK, and, and

480
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,558
just like that you can see in a

481
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:02,599
matter of seconds, uh, honestly

482
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,259
instantly

483
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,699
those nodes are now at 0% utilization.

484
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,630
They're underutilized,

485
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,489
so what do we expect to happen? Well,

486
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,660
you'll see for yourself. Um,

487
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,739
next what we wanna do here is apply

488
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,160
a node pool

489
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,160
that is gonna be our kind of accelerated

490
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,920
compute here.

491
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:23,557
OK, what do I mean? Uh, essentially, well,

492
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,468
if we wanna run an LLM,

493
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:27,868
we can't just run it on basic CPU

494
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,239
memory-based instances.

495
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,519
We need a proper GPU attached,

496
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,548
and we want

497
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,009
an Nvidia GPU.

498
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:36,628
So let me open up Quiro again,

499
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,208
my favorite code editor.

500
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,959
Of course, and uh we're gonna, we're gonna

501
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,000
go to the GPU node pull. Let me scroll down and

502
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,078
just let me show you folks how you

503
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,239
configure a node pull

504
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,930
before we kind of took it for granted, there's a general

505
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,078
purpose node pull that comes with every EKS auto

506
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:53,559
mode cluster that's gonna let us deploy

507
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
general purpose workloads. But if we

508
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,660
wanna do something more interesting

509
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,358
and most of the time you're gonna wanna do something custom

510
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,519
for your workloads, you're gonna wanna customize the

511
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,559
type of nodes you deploy.

512
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,130
And you may remember with managed node groups you would

513
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,130
have to kind of explicitly list out

514
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,170
all the type of instances you wanna use and

515
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,568
it configures an ASG an auto scaling

516
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,269
group, and,

517
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,410
uh, you know, it integrates with cluster auto scaler

518
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,489
and there's just a lot going on there with

519
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:19,118
Carpenter,

520
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:21,608
uh, the underlying open source project that

521
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,759
powers the dynamic node auto scaling

522
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,809
in EKS auto mode.

523
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:26,000
Instead of,

524
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:28,439
you know, building up the list of instances,

525
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,880
we filter down based on our requirements.

526
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,489
We tell it we want, um, instances

527
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,539
that are either spot or on demand, and if we're

528
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,009
lucky today, we'll get a spot instance which is

529
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:40,049
major cost savings on uh

530
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,529
G6 G5 instances.

531
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,279
Um, we also want it to be in

532
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,118
the G class, so G5, G6,

533
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,469
uh, greater than instance

534
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,559
generation 4 again, so we get those two that

535
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,618
we're looking for, and of course within

536
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:54,959
those instances there's large X

537
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,969
4X large, so on and so forth,

538
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,279
um, and we give it an architecture as

539
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,598
well. So we're telling Carpenter, here's

540
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,559
my requirements,

541
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,358
figure out what I want, right?

542
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
All right, let's, let's keep going here. I'm gonna go back to

543
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,660
the CLI and actually apply

544
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,078
the deployment.

545
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,568
So recently OpenAI open source

546
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,809
their GPT models they call the GPT

547
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:17,009
OSS. I'm gonna deploy the 20

548
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,348
billion parameter model which does require

549
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,489
a a pretty good Nvidia

550
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,568
instance GPU.

551
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,130
So as soon as I created that, you can see

552
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,250
here about 8 seconds ago it decided

553
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,848
to spin up a.

554
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,250
54 X large on oh hey, by

555
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,269
the way, take a look at these two instances

556
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,189
uh that we had scaled down from earlier

557
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:36,769
you can see they're already scaling down those nodes

558
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:39,410
are being deleted because we're consolidating

559
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:41,838
and by the way, if we scale to like 3 instances

560
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,890
rather than 0, it would probably have removed

561
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,858
one of the instances,

562
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,180
OK. This 20

563
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,920
billion parameter model is

564
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:51,299
14 gigs, so while

565
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,380
it decides to pull the image and take some

566
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,459
time, we're gonna switch gears here and

567
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,459
take you to the console. We're gonna go back to that in

568
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,890
a minute here and earlier I cheated

569
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,059
a bit and we started with an existing auto mode

570
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,219
cluster. It was version 1.33.

571
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,868
I do wanna show you how we create a cluster, but

572
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,088
over here if we go down to

573
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,630
the version of the cluster itself,

574
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,890
uh, we can see we can upgrade it to 1.34

575
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,368
and also there's a create backup

576
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,519
button here. So one important thing to

577
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,828
understand here as a customer of,

578
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:21,549
um,

579
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,118
uh, of, of, of consumer of auto mode,

580
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,430
you get to decide when to upgrade the

581
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,068
control plane.

582
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,650
We won't take that over for you. This is a major

583
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,368
operation and you should be in control of that.

584
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,848
But we do control the node upgrades,

585
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,400
all the components that, uh, Alex showed

586
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,449
earlier, right? Maybe I can just quickly jump

587
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:40,368
back to that slide, um,

588
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:42,689
and show you folks all those components that might be

589
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:43,750
running inside a cluster.

590
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,239
We'll upgrade those for you as well. Uh,

591
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,489
you don't have to worry about the worker nodes next

592
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,568
time they're restarted, they'll be in the latest version as

593
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:52,650
well. This makes your life

594
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,229
easier

595
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,689
and you know, take some of that undifferentiated

596
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,689
work and gives it to us. I do wanna quickly

597
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,328
call out this create backup button.

598
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Uh, essentially, um, uh, just, uh, uh,

599
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,000
a few weeks ago, maybe a month ago, we

600
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,189
announced support for,

601
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,650
um, Amazon EKS and AWS

602
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,650
backup. So now with the click

603
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,719
of a button you can back up your clusters,

604
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,170
which we tell you it might be a good idea to

605
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,209
do before you upgrade your cluster. It's up

606
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,279
to you, but it's an irreversible action to

607
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,689
upgrade the control plane version of your cluster. So

608
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,890
you might wanna create a backup and with AWS

609
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,529
backup it's that much easier.

610
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,279
Just a quick call out. OK,

611
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,934
let's get back into. It so this is our

612
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,973
existing cluster, but I wanna show you folks

613
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,693
how to create a fresh cluster. So we'll go to clusters,

614
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,285
hit create cluster,

615
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:37,934
and we have this relatively

616
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:40,233
new, uh, quick configuration flow

617
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,654
with EKS auto mode clusters. You can go to custom

618
00:21:42,654 --> 00:21:44,934
configuration and set everything as well, but

619
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:46,243
we wanted to show you,

620
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,814
yes, buzzword incoming, a one click

621
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:49,755
deploy option

622
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,213
for auto mode. Um, let's zoom in

623
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,255
here a little bit and just go through the options.

624
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:55,184
We'll scroll down.

625
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,660
We can, uh, randomize a name

626
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,900
for the cluster, so

627
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:01,000
serious pop crab. I like it.

628
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:02,459
Let's scroll down,

629
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,880
uh, pick a version, and then look,

630
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,779
I know

631
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,858
Kubernetes SRE experts

632
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,559
that still stumble around creating cluster

633
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,640
roles and node roles.

634
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,160
We made this easy for you. Hit create recommended

635
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,269
role. You click, click, click, and we'll make one for you.

636
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,559
In this case, I happen to have a couple of roles in

637
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,660
the uh account that I can already use.

638
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:22,088
Makes life easier.

639
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:24,509
I know a lot of you probably use EKS Cuddle out

640
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,549
there. This does that for you. Well,

641
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,630
now we do that for you in the console as

642
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,910
well. Um, OK, let's scroll

643
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,348
down here. We have the VPC

644
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:35,509
that's preloaded and the subnets as

645
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:37,709
well, but I actually wanna dive into

646
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,709
something, um, a bit more interesting

647
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,910
here. If we go to this quick configuration

648
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,939
defaults, there's a section here. Let me just zoom

649
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:46,250
in here so you can see it a little bit better.

650
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:47,368
Um, OK,

651
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,118
so essentially with any auto mode cluster

652
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,380
these are the components you get out of the box and again I

653
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,348
know we've talked about this before, but I really wanna

654
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,818
drive this in. So application load balancing,

655
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:57,559
when we create,

656
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,189
uh, a, a service and we need load balancers,

657
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,949
application load bouncers or network load balancers,

658
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,500
we'll look at the Kubernetes objects you deploy and

659
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,118
create

660
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:08,640
the kind of, uh, corresponding resources

661
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:11,239
in the AWS back end that comes out of the box,

662
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,680
block storage, the EBS CSI driver.

663
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,989
Container storage interface just the way

664
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:18,098
that Kubernetes is able to help you

665
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:20,380
create back-end storage for staple

666
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,630
workloads that comes out of the box as well.

667
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,989
Compute auto scaling, I think you all know what this is. I

668
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:26,989
said it like 5 times already. It's Carpenter. It's

669
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,229
an underlying, uh, open source project

670
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:30,809
that we open sourced a few years ago.

671
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:32,890
Um, we'll handle that for you as well.

672
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,269
And folks at Carpenter, if

673
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:37,348
you've ever set it up before, there's some roles you

674
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,670
gotta set up. There's, you know, you have to deploy

675
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,150
maybe a managed node group for it.

676
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,640
You don't have to. We're gonna run that in our control plane.

677
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:46,140
GPU support. That means batteries included,

678
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:48,449
right? Again, I, I said that before. Essentially

679
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,709
any time, you know, if you didn't

680
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:51,848
leverage auto mode,

681
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:54,309
you're, you're doing this thing where you have to line

682
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,019
up the kernel version of your Amazon

683
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,180
machine image and the and the

684
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,328
instance, um, to the device,

685
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,449
uh, device driver version

686
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:04,900
for Nvidia.

687
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:07,549
You also have to install the Nvidia device

688
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,719
plug-in. And then maybe you, yeah, you want

689
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,799
tools like the DCGM

690
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,088
Nvidia exporter if you're familiar with that. It

691
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:16,709
gives like in Nvidia logs to Prometheus,

692
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,118
I think that's data center GPU

693
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:21,160
manager, DCGM exporter that

694
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,368
comes out of the box for you.

695
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,068
And then these last couple of bullet points for Q proxy,

696
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,180
VPCCNI,

697
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,338
core DNS.

698
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,809
I know it's like a ton of acronyms. Just know

699
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,809
it's like pot to pod networking. It's the networking

700
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:34,088
that any Kubernetes cluster needs.

701
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:35,630
We handle that for you as well.

702
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,469
That means not just that you don't have to

703
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:40,229
worry about the nodes they run on,

704
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,769
also that we'll upgrade them for you, right?

705
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,930
So, uh, those are all the components that come

706
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,130
with it, and we'll scroll back down

707
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,209
here and we can hit create. And so

708
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,250
now you see, you know, what I had to do

709
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,189
to prepare.

710
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,799
The cluster for the 5 minute demo

711
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,019
that I had done earlier. You hit create and you're

712
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:57,719
good to go.

713
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,368
OK, now hopefully I've given it enough time.

714
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,618
It looks like that pod has been

715
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:03,239
scheduled,

716
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:05,769
um, on that G54X large from

717
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,779
earlier. Remember this is the GPT

718
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,838
OSS 20 billion parameter model.

719
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,259
We're just gonna describe pods. There's only one, so it'll

720
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:13,479
come back very quickly,

721
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,539
and I wanna call something out here.

722
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:18,430
Um, we successfully pulled

723
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,838
the GPT OSS model from my private ECR.

724
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,078
I put it in the ECR before this talk. Um,

725
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,250
it's 14 gigs, right? You

726
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,739
can see that. I think it's 14 billion bytes,

727
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,750
and it was able to pull that

728
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,989
in just over a minute.

729
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,170
Quick tech recap,

730
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,650
couple of years ago, uh, AWS open

731
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,250
sourced a project called Sochi.

732
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,670
Back then it was for lazy loading, but later

733
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,930
on we released a capability called Parallel

734
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,189
Pull. Essentially it allows you

735
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:47,469
to pull multiple layers of a Docker

736
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:48,049
image

737
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,289
concurrently.

738
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,390
Now with generative AI it's

739
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,469
extremely important, you know, that time to first

740
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,078
token should be as low as possible,

741
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,900
so pulling a 14 billion

742
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,949
byte model, right? 20 billion parameter,

743
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:03,828
14 gigs in a minute,

744
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,229
uh, well, before Sochi that would

745
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:08,348
take 2 to 3 minutes. So that's already

746
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:09,789
such a dramatic improvement.

747
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,430
With auto mode we can figure that for you

748
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,318
out of the box,

749
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:15,868
uh, on these uh on these G instances

750
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,328
for example we get that parallelpo

751
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,009
offered by Sochi out of the box ready

752
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:23,088
to go and this really shows

753
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:23,828
you kind of

754
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:24,848
the things that

755
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,209
I didn't have to do to make this

756
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,009
demo work.

757
00:26:28,368 --> 00:26:30,368
I, I mean you guys saw it. It was a

758
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:31,430
fresh auto mode cluster.

759
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,750
I applied, uh, the, the

760
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,108
configuration. Uh, essentially, uh,

761
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,318
a deployment that had one deployment

762
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:39,229
and one service,

763
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,979
and it integrated with the Nvidia GPU

764
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:43,979
drivers. It gives me the logs that are streaming

765
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,059
to Prometheus. I have Sochi parallel

766
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:47,598
pole support out of the box,

767
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,118
all of these things that

768
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,539
I didn't have to do that are

769
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,539
handled for me, um, and that's, that's

770
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,439
what I mean by,

771
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:56,818
you know, batteries included. Another way to think about

772
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:59,199
it is the infrastructure for auto mode

773
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:00,809
is GPU aware.

774
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,130
OK, I think we've given enough time, by the way,

775
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,209
after the model pulls it then needs to

776
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,289
start it, which takes a couple of minutes.

777
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,689
I think we've given it enough time. Let's switch

778
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,890
to another tab here. We're just gonna

779
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:15,400
port forward, um, that

780
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,750
service that we created earlier,

781
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:18,789
the GPTOSS service.

782
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,150
Boom, there we go.

783
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:22,769
Now let's ask it a simple question. I have a copy

784
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,809
paste here. It's gonna curl that local

785
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,848
host 8000.

786
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,039
As it what is machine learning,

787
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:28,979
and

788
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,729
I piped it to JQ just to make the pretty output.

789
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,049
OK, taking a look here we can

790
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,088
see it's a thinking model. So

791
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,209
the reasoning here is what is machine

792
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,469
learning. They expect a concise explanation

793
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,709
and there we go. There's a response.

794
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,009
So essentially what did we

795
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:45,608
show here?

796
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:48,049
Essentially it's uh infrastructure

797
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:50,209
that moves at the speed of your ideas,

798
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,328
right? It's we, we wanted to run an

799
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:54,029
LLM inference workload.

800
00:27:54,449 --> 00:27:56,529
We have a deployment. We wanted GPU

801
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:57,439
based instances.

802
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,309
We first created a node pool.

803
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,779
We told the node pool the type of.

804
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,170
Uh, nodes that could support this

805
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,250
workload and then we created the deployment

806
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,368
itself. And really

807
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:10,670
when I was thinking about how to make an

808
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,858
exciting demo for Auto mode, it, it,

809
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,009
it was really showcasing all the things I

810
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,868
didn't have to do. It was the, the streamlined

811
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:19,868
experience and so hopefully I

812
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,910
got the point across of it, it, it

813
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,949
really is that easy, uh, to,

814
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:26,059
to deploy even the most, you know,

815
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,189
meaty

816
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,568
like, uh, production ready,

817
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,729
like a 14

818
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,328
gigabyte LLM model, um,

819
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:35,160
in a matter of minutes,

820
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,828
OK. So I know a lot of you

821
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:40,088
have the question on your mind right now

822
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,098
this is all great for a demo,

823
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:45,108
but what about for a regulated

824
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:46,449
a high scale

825
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:47,750
environment?

826
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,469
Well, to talk about that I would love

827
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:51,489
to introduce.

828
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,348
Dan Levine from Capital One.

829
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,390
To talk a little bit

830
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,269
about how they started using

831
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,729
Amazon Ecas Auto mode and how they got

832
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:02,750
to where they are today.

833
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:04,250
Here you go, Dan. Hey folks,

834
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:07,068
thank you very much, Cy, for the introduction.

835
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:09,068
My name's Dan Levine.

836
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,170
I've been working at Capital One for

837
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,299
about 8.5 years now,

838
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,529
and my main focus has been the implementation

839
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,858
and maintainability of

840
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,410
Kubernete's at scale.

841
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,989
Like Cy said, Capital One is a highly

842
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:25,250
compliant, highly regulated company

843
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,709
that needs things to be risk averse.

844
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:28,900
In order to do that,

845
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:31,229
we need certain assurances to use a

846
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,269
technology like EKS Auto.

847
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,500
So, I'm gonna talk about a few things today.

848
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:37,618
I think the thing that might be most poignant

849
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:39,890
for all of you is a little bit about our journey.

850
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,000
We didn't get here

851
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,098
overnight.

852
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,539
There's been 10 years of build-up since Kubernetes

853
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:45,338
has been released

854
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,199
that led us to the decisions to adopt

855
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
EKS Auto mode.

856
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,539
I also wanna talk about some of the solutions

857
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:54,630
that we've come up along the way to make it

858
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,779
more palatable to be used

859
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:58,559
in an enterprise such as ours.

860
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,140
Of course this is an EKS Auto talk. I wanna talk

861
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,140
a little bit about EKS Auto. I wanna talk

862
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,219
about the benefits that we've received from

863
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:07,219
EKS Auto and our enterprise and

864
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,318
a little bit about how our users

865
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,818
are using EKS Auto.

866
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,750
So, like all good speeches,

867
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,930
let me take you back 10 years

868
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,568
to when Kubernetes was first born, and

869
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,769
a lot of different platform teams

870
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,170
within Capital One were trying to implement

871
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,969
Kubernetes. We were bootstrapping EtsyDs,

872
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:28,529
we were managing control planes.

873
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,930
We were doing all of this in several different

874
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,969
areas of the business. All of these platform

875
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:35,209
teams that thought that Kubernetes

876
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,719
was a right use case for them

877
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,130
had different opinions about how to do all

878
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,969
of these things.

879
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,219
It was a challenge,

880
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:44,118
created a lot of arbitrary uniqueness

881
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:45,199
within our enterprise,

882
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,779
and we weren't able to solve a lot of problems

883
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,358
quickly.

884
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,199
Now, the three main challenges

885
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,578
that we hit because of this

886
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,559
were a high SRE effort,

887
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:57,180
constant churn, and scalability

888
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,759
issues.

889
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,358
High SRE effort because

890
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:01,420
everyone's doing something a little bit differently.

891
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,699
They're spending a lot of hours trying to figure

892
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:05,939
out how do I do this correctly.

893
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,199
High churn because

894
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:10,699
in Capital One, we have a set of compliance

895
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,989
software that needs to run on Kubernetes

896
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:13,920
within the enterprise.

897
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:16,000
This software needs maintained,

898
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:17,338
updated,

899
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,459
and controlled.

900
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,459
Scalability because

901
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:22,868
frankly Kubernays was a little young at that point

902
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:24,910
in time but also nobody was

903
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,229
working together on a centralized

904
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,289
solution. So what do

905
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,368
we do? We moved to

906
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:32,549
a centralized solution.

907
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:35,059
We called it the federated

908
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,640
model.

909
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,180
Now within Capital One, we decided

910
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,818
that Kubernetes and at the time EKS

911
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:41,959
should be

912
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,348
managed by centralized tooling that

913
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:46,160
a team should carefully curate

914
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,969
for all of the platform teams within the enterprise.

915
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:51,380
These platform teams would then be

916
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,420
able to contribute more to the

917
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,500
business value that they were actually creating

918
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,279
with their platforms

919
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,750
now. In order to do that, we

920
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,650
had some tenants.

921
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,348
We had some core principles that we

922
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,348
really wanted to enforce to make sure

923
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,348
it could work at the scale that we needed to.

924
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,509
We had several platform teams that wanted to

925
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:10,709
use Kubernetes.

926
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,650
Those tenants were to be able to meet

927
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,489
our platform teams where they were.

928
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:17,180
We wanted to do it with them

929
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:18,410
and not for them.

930
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,029
So

931
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,608
we created a sense of shared ownership and

932
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,568
empowerment

933
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,029
across the enterprise with our platform teams

934
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,170
that use Kubernetes to ensure that they were

935
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,088
getting the product that not only they wanted.

936
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:31,729
But they liked

937
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:33,670
But how did we do that?

938
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:35,479
We looked upstream.

939
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,309
We looked at Kubernetes to see how it was kind of

940
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:39,250
solving this problem

941
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,689
within the community,

942
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,170
and we used

943
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,430
a concept that they've invented the

944
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,650
special interest group,

945
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:46,818
or SIG.

946
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,979
When we had critical challenges within our

947
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:50,719
enterprise,

948
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:51,828
we would create a SIG

949
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,400
that involved

950
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,689
some subject matter, and that SIG

951
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:56,890
would solve the problem.

952
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,959
We needed to ship metrics off to somewhere.

953
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:01,299
You'd get the engineers that had the

954
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:01,880
pain

955
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,380
and the people that were passionate about the problems

956
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,199
in the same room, in the same SIG,

957
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,000
to solve these problems.

958
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,559
All of their solutions would then

959
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:12,799
come right back to the centralized tooling

960
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,140
that we maintained and pushed out to the platform

961
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,578
teams. This was great.

962
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We were operating at a, at a higher scale,

963
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:22,519
we were innovating, we were doing Kubernetes

964
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,588
in a mature manner,

965
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,979
but. We still had some pain.

966
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:29,348
Two areas primarily that we experienced

967
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:31,108
pain was infrastructure management.

968
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:33,170
And container management.

969
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:35,828
Infrastructure, when you get to the level of

970
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:37,088
scale that we did.

971
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:40,098
You need to make sure that you're patching OS's,

972
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,328
you're, you're using the right instances.

973
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,699
You're not overprovisioning and spending

974
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,299
hundreds of thousands of dollars on

975
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:49,039
dead air CPU cycles.

976
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,029
Container management because like I said

977
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,239
before we had compliance software

978
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,670
that needed to be pushed out to every

979
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,709
single cluster.

980
00:33:58,189 --> 00:34:00,209
That software needed to be maintained.

981
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:02,009
It needed to be updated.

982
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,838
We were spending hundreds and hundreds

983
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:05,769
of hours

984
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,289
maintaining all of this and making sure

985
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,869
that it was doing the right thing in our enterprise.

986
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,838
And it caused a lot of friction.

987
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,309
And that's where we get to today.

988
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,360
That's where we get to

989
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,300
EKS auto mode.

990
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,039
EKS Auto mode,

991
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,469
like Sy and Alex have been

992
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,469
saying, manages a lot of that for us.

993
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:28,789
AWS is in the business of taking away that

994
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:30,949
management pain because frankly, I've

995
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,030
used Kubernetes for a long time. I don't

996
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,228
wanna manage it anymore.

997
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,849
I've been doing it enough.

998
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:37,909
Now I know what you're thinking

999
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,789
before I kind of say how EKS Auto addresses

1000
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:41,449
the pain,

1001
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,148
I do wanna acknowledge

1002
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,688
you don't take a massive financial

1003
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:47,688
institution, switch on auto mode on a

1004
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:48,820
Monday and say,

1005
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,949
great, that's terrifying.

1006
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:53,668
There's several things that you need to do

1007
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,090
in order to adopt, and I wanna talk about that adoption

1008
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,699
really quickly.

1009
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,780
We decided that

1010
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,559
to dog food EKS auto mode,

1011
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:02,760
we would use it

1012
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,148
with our central delivery platforms. The

1013
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:06,179
centralized team

1014
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:07,840
that created the tooling.

1015
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,659
Well, let's throw EKS Auto at that.

1016
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,000
Once that was working,

1017
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,438
once the control plane was behaving like we

1018
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:17,840
expected with all the software and compliance containers

1019
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,978
that we were handing it.

1020
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,349
We didn't have promises, we had data.

1021
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:24,050
We had actual proof that

1022
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,289
EKS Auto was solving the problem that we

1023
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:27,030
believed it to.

1024
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,949
Once we did that, the conversation became a lot

1025
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:32,309
easier. And that data

1026
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:34,829
was addressing the two pain points

1027
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:35,969
that I talked about earlier.

1028
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,418
Automated infrastructure management.

1029
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:41,550
Carpenter backs EKS auto mode.

1030
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,449
With Carpenter in EKS auto mode,

1031
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:46,320
we no longer have to worry about

1032
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,500
am I provisioning the right instances,

1033
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,139
am I using CPU that I don't need,

1034
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:52,429
we give it a deployment,

1035
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,438
we let it run,

1036
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:54,878
Carpenter does the rest.

1037
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,599
It's managed for us.

1038
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:58,099
Also

1039
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,360
Simplified container management.

1040
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:03,719
My team is no longer spending hours

1041
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,820
and hours focused on upgrading containers

1042
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
like EBS CSI driver or the

1043
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,260
load balancer controller that are table stakes

1044
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,119
to run a Kubernetes cluster

1045
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,360
at scale,

1046
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,239
within a massive enterprise.

1047
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,510
Right now we're looking at some other use cases

1048
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,789
for this. The two primary ones for us

1049
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:21,728
are machine learning.

1050
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:24,128
In a multi-tenant platform,

1051
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,760
these make great use cases for EKS Auto mode

1052
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,228
because of the scale that they have,

1053
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,860
especially in a multi-tenant platform

1054
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,250
that has several different applications, a

1055
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,280
platform team won't have to worry about

1056
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,269
what they're throwing at the cluster again.

1057
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:38,918
They deploy it,

1058
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,179
schedules,

1059
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:42,780
the workload and infrastructure is handled for us.

1060
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,139
Now, Just to

1061
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:48,619
close here, there's been a lot of key metrics

1062
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:50,739
that we have deemed

1063
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,688
valuable in our usage of EKS A,

1064
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:55,418
but I think one of the best ones is one that's

1065
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:56,820
a little more intangible.

1066
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,320
It's silence

1067
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:00,269
And what do I mean by that?

1068
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:03,010
Well, before EKS auto mode,

1069
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:05,369
a lot of our customers would come to us and

1070
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:07,489
they'd say, hey, why is my managed node

1071
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:08,438
group not updating?

1072
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,809
Why is EBS CSI driver stuck in

1073
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,949
a crashback loop? Why isn't it on the version

1074
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:14,289
that I need it to be on?

1075
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:15,860
And now

1076
00:37:16,438 --> 00:37:18,530
with that. Our Slack channels

1077
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,260
are silent.

1078
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,809
Nobody's asking any more questions around

1079
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,090
these problems that we were dealing and spending massive

1080
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,128
amounts of hours troubleshooting with our

1081
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:27,449
platform team partners,

1082
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:28,869
and that silence

1083
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,809
is golden.

1084
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:32,739
So with that I'd like to close and hand

1085
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,750
it back over to Alex to talk a little bit

1086
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,809
about some of the great features that they've delivered

1087
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,519
over the last year with EKS Auto mode.

1088
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:40,070
Thank you very much. Thanks, Dan.

1089
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:41,668
Appreciate it, Dan.

1090
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,809
Dan, stay on stage with us. It's all good,

1091
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:44,849
um.

1092
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,500
You know, so one of those features, for example,

1093
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,039
is this Sochi parallel poll and unpack

1094
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,938
feature. We just launched that this fall,

1095
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:54,679
dynamically drastically reduces

1096
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,840
container startup times and just one of the

1097
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,458
many things that we've been working on,

1098
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,918
you know, just like those 250+ features

1099
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:04,039
that EKS itself has been launching over the last

1100
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:04,809
8 years,

1101
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,389
EKS Audible has been busy responding to

1102
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,840
customer feedback and building new capabilities

1103
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,079
that help delight and make customers'

1104
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:12,760
lives easier,

1105
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:15,530
so. We've

1106
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,789
been making continuous improvements and while

1107
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:19,958
all the details are available in

1108
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,969
our our AWS user guide for EKS

1109
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,090
and there's a release notes page specifically, I

1110
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,239
want to highlight some of the kind of most significant additions

1111
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,369
that we've made over the last year and there's 6

1112
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,369
key areas that we've been focusing on,

1113
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,728
each in response to specific feedback that

1114
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,969
we've been getting from our customers as they've

1115
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:35,728
looked at auto mode,

1116
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,510
thought about if they could use it and what they might need to adopt.

1117
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,389
And so first I want to talk about expanded availability.

1118
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,378
You know how we brought auto mode to new regions

1119
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,909
including the US GovCloud and local zones, making

1120
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,280
it accessible for public sector workloads and edge computing

1121
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,070
use cases.

1122
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:52,659
Next, we'll explore the advanced configuration

1123
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:54,918
options that give you more control over

1124
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,958
networking and security while maintaining the operational

1125
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:59,030
simplicity that's core to EKS

1126
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,659
Auto mode.

1127
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,329
Then we'll dive a little bit deeper into that Sochi Parallel pole

1128
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:02,840
feature

1129
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,958
and explain how it automatically

1130
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,039
is optimized for GPU instances and why it makes

1131
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:10,469
it such a game changer for AIML workloads.

1132
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,579
We'll also cover our enhanced security and compliance

1133
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:15,579
capabilities that make it easier for

1134
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:17,610
customers like Capital One to adopt auto

1135
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,889
mode across large enterprises and highly regulated

1136
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:20,590
industries.

1137
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,208
After that, we'll discuss a couple of capacity

1138
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,280
management features and then finally we'll

1139
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,510
wrap up with thoughts about how all these work together

1140
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,320
to continue to evolve Kubernete's

1141
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,860
operations. So

1142
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,938
first, one of the most requested features for

1143
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,918
Auto mode has been broader regional availability,

1144
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:40,418
especially for government and regulated workloads.

1145
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,938
I'm excited to share that EKAS Automode is now available

1146
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:45,239
in all the commercial regions where EKS is available

1147
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,418
with the exception of the Abis China regions in Beijing

1148
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,099
and Ningxia.

1149
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,329
And in 2025 we expanded that to

1150
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,769
include the AWS GovCloud regions, enabling

1151
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,050
agencies and organizations with sensitive workloads

1152
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,809
to take advantage of AutoMode's operational benefits

1153
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,530
while meeting their compliance requirements.

1154
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,010
It's a natural fit for AutoMode's

1155
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,820
high operational and security bar.

1156
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,010
Additionally,

1157
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,469
this year we've brought Auto mode to AWS local

1158
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:10,679
zones, allowing you to place Kuberne's

1159
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,030
applications closer to your end users or on-premise

1160
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,539
systems,

1161
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,989
reducing latency while maintaining the

1162
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:16,769
operational simplicity

1163
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,219
that Automode provides. This has been particularly

1164
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:21,750
valuable for customers running latency sensitive

1165
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,978
applications like real-time analytics or perhaps games.

1166
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,648
We've been significantly expanding

1167
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:30,679
the configurations that are available in auto mode

1168
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,780
without affecting its simplicity, and to be honest, this

1169
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
has been one of the largest areas that we've

1170
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,260
been investing in over the last year.

1171
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,728
We took a very deliberate approach when we launched Auto

1172
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,019
mode to have it have a relatively simple

1173
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,800
set of configurations. That were available

1174
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:45,340
and we wanted customers to come to us and tell us

1175
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,659
what specific other knobs and buttons

1176
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,780
they may need for it to be a good

1177
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,159
fit for their use case and so

1178
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:53,039
with that feedback we've been busy

1179
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,438
answering and delivering those kinds of customizations

1180
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:57,458
that customers need.

1181
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,938
So first, and one of the most highly requested features

1182
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:01,938
that we had for auto mode was the ability to

1183
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,019
use separate subnets and security groups

1184
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,179
for pods as opposed to nodes, which

1185
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,260
you can now do through pod subnet

1186
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,409
selector terms and pod security group selector

1187
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,550
terms. This may not

1188
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,679
be as familiar because when you're running when

1189
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,739
you're trying to do this in a standard EKS cluster

1190
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,199
through the VPCCNI, you do this through a mode called

1191
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,500
custom networking.

1192
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,039
This approach achieves the same thing but does

1193
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,239
so in I think a little bit of a cleaner user

1194
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,478
experience that's very similar to other kinds

1195
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:29,478
of configurations that

1196
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:30,760
you may be familiar with in auto mode.

1197
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,760
We've also added a bunch of other advanced

1198
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
networking configurations, things like

1199
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,039
the ability to disable or enable

1200
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:40,458
the ability to associate a public IP address

1201
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,829
with the instances that Auto mode launches.

1202
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,179
And being able to specify whether

1203
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,188
or not the traffic on

1204
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:50,429
leading nodes that auto mode launches

1205
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,179
should be routed through a proxy

1206
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:55,030
so you can specify that

1207
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,099
certain destinations should be going through

1208
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,059
a forward proxy,

1209
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:02,260
whereas others shouldn't like local host destinations.

1210
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,079
This is essential to support environments that

1211
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,090
require this kind of proxy for outbound

1212
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,918
connectivity or compliance reasons.

1213
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,708
For customers, we've heard a lot that customers

1214
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:15,429
needed to provide various private certificate

1215
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:17,590
authority material to the nodes that

1216
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,489
Auto mode runs to be able to authenticate

1217
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:21,530
with other systems in their environment.

1218
00:42:22,378 --> 00:42:24,579
So you can now do this through the certificate

1219
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:27,300
bundles parameter. This lets you

1220
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,559
provide sort of a set

1221
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,780
of public key material for

1222
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,280
auto mode instances to use as they communicate

1223
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,378
with other services in

1224
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:36,938
your network.

1225
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,340
This is particularly valuable for

1226
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,418
organizations with internal PKI systems or

1227
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:42,280
custom cert

1228
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:43,699
authority requirements.

1229
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,699
These additions make it so that

1230
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:49,079
Autode's operational simplicity

1231
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,938
is

1232
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,438
paramount while still giving you the configuration

1233
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:55,039
flexibility that you need to meet your specific

1234
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,059
organization's requirements.

1235
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,840
And I just wanna add one thing here folks.

1236
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,369
It's like

1237
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:02,500
when we launched Auto mode, uh, we

1238
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,579
started listening to how customers were using it

1239
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:06,820
and so I just wanna stress on something you said, Alex,

1240
00:43:06,938 --> 00:43:09,019
uh, you know, talk to us. We

1241
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,059
will share with you our, our public road

1242
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,019
map on Git GitHub.

1243
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:14,550
I know Alex probably looks over

1244
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,820
the, the, the issues on our road map every

1245
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,648
day. It's probably in his morning routine.

1246
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:21,320
So we, we really are listening and, uh,

1247
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,708
tell us how you wanna use auto mode and.

1248
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,878
He'll make it happen.

1249
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,398
Uh yeah, and to be, that's exactly right. Like we, there's

1250
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,478
a number of other things that we've already heard,

1251
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,679
things that I think we'll hear in the future about if

1252
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,860
only Auto mode would let me set X, Y, or

1253
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,159
Z, it'd be a great fit for my use case. That's

1254
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,398
exactly what we want to hear, and that kind of feedback is invaluable

1255
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,429
for me as a product manager to figure out what we should

1256
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:42,438
be doing next and, and how we can help enable our

1257
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,478
customers to offload all of this kind

1258
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:46,519
of operational burden that that AutoMode allows you

1259
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,820
to um to delegate delegate to us. So

1260
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:49,679
please keep it coming.

1261
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,320
Um

1262
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:55,389
We saw this live in size demo, the

1263
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:57,429
Sochi Parallel image poll and unpacked, and this is a

1264
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,619
common pain with containerized workloads, especially

1265
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,739
those using for AIML

1266
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,789
use cases where the time it

1267
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:06,208
takes to download that image and unpack it

1268
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:08,938
can delay really meaningful metrics for

1269
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,889
these kinds of scenarios like time to first token,

1270
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,969
and these are increasingly critical as

1271
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:16,429
companies adopt more and more

1272
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,530
AIML and inference

1273
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,500
use cases.

1274
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,938
We've addressed this, as Cy showed and mentioned,

1275
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:24,148
by implementing the Sochi parallel container pole

1276
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:26,148
and unpack capability, dramatically

1277
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:28,489
reducing the startup time by parallellyzing

1278
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:30,829
these operations for different layers in the container.

1279
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:31,728
The best part,

1280
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,429
as Cy mentioned, is that this is also automatically

1281
00:44:34,429 --> 00:44:36,789
enabled for every GPU enabled

1282
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,789
instance in auto mode, as well as those that

1283
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:39,820
don't have GPUs

1284
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:41,969
but have local NVME storage.

1285
00:44:42,398 --> 00:44:44,610
So these are things like G series instances

1286
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,679
from Size demo or the P

1287
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,840
series with you know other like Nvidia

1288
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,619
hardware, ranium instances,

1289
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,199
as well as a variety of others that just happen to have

1290
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,659
that really fast local

1291
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:56,260
local MDME storage.

1292
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:59,179
There's zero configuration required for this. We've

1293
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:01,398
we've done a bunch of work to figure out what the right

1294
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,610
settings are because there's a fair amount of them for Sochi

1295
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,300
and applied them automatically

1296
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,679
for the given instance that happens to be launched at that

1297
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,179
moment. This drastically reduces

1298
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,360
the container startup time as you saw in Size demo like what,

1299
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:14,739
2 to 3 minutes down to like 1 minute and 15

1300
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:16,780
seconds or something. Yeah, we've seen up to 60

1301
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,820
and even sometimes higher percentage reduction

1302
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,949
in the total pull time. Yeah,

1303
00:45:20,688 --> 00:45:22,699
um, and you know as your organizations

1304
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:25,030
start to think about how they can, they can leverage AI,

1305
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,300
uh, this will become, I think, an increasingly important

1306
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,378
factor in, um, you know, how to,

1307
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,478
how to serve those workloads quickly

1308
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:32,719
and efficiently.

1309
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,409
So you know Dan

1310
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:39,010
Capital One works in a very highly regulated

1311
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:39,610
industry, um,

1312
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,050
a large, you know, a large requirement for compliance

1313
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,090
and security for us is our top priority.

1314
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,809
We've added several important capabilities

1315
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:50,769
over the last year to make sure that Auto mode

1316
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:52,918
can still can meet even the highest security standards.

1317
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,958
So first and foremost, you can now encrypt

1318
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,969
both the root volume and the data

1319
00:45:57,969 --> 00:46:00,090
volume of instances launched by

1320
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,250
auto mode using custom encryption keys that you

1321
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,360
provide. So these are like

1322
00:46:03,648 --> 00:46:05,878
KMS keys that you you you you

1323
00:46:05,878 --> 00:46:07,059
provide to AWS

1324
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,449
and that will then allow you to encrypt

1325
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,610
all of the data that resides on those

1326
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,188
instances

1327
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:14,889
for customers in regulated industries and as

1328
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:17,239
part of the launch into the US GovCloud

1329
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,898
regions. We've also enabled PIPS validated

1330
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:22,289
cryptographic modules for

1331
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,300
EKS Auto mode's controllers and

1332
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,039
the instances that that we launch.

1333
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:28,659
So this means that you can activate

1334
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,978
these PIPS crypto cryptographic modules

1335
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:33,099
using a setting in the node class for auto mode,

1336
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:34,840
so advanced Security. Phipps,

1337
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,938
um, and this will ensure that your clusters

1338
00:46:37,938 --> 00:46:40,019
comply with federal information

1339
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:41,079
processing standards. So

1340
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,829
a key thing for a lot of customers in the public. Sector

1341
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:45,929
or that have customers of their own that are in the

1342
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:49,090
public sector and run in these

1343
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,239
gov cloud regions is to be able to

1344
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,269
attest that their infrastructure meets

1345
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:53,969
these requirements.

1346
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,369
This is one piece in how you can help

1347
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:58,469
enable that with just a single setting

1348
00:46:58,469 --> 00:46:59,769
in a YAML.

1349
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,378
One of my favorite new features addresses a

1350
00:47:03,378 --> 00:47:05,449
common IAM challenge. So you

1351
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:07,458
know Cy was alluding to how even seasoned

1352
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,579
operators will struggle with getting

1353
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:11,619
the right sets of IM resources stood

1354
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:13,829
up, and you know often it's

1355
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:16,019
a really sensitive operation to delegate

1356
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:18,250
out to large swaths of an

1357
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,579
organization. It may not be something that every

1358
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,619
user in a given team

1359
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:25,070
should be able to do, that is creating new IAM

1360
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,840
roles or attaching various policies to them.

1361
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,668
So you can now enable teams

1362
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:31,789
to use auto mode without having to grant them those

1363
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,829
additional permissions. They just need an instance

1364
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:34,369
profile.

1365
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:37,208
This simplifies the access management

1366
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:39,559
and maintains your security posture.

1367
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:41,829
I think that this is kind of a great example of a

1368
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:43,989
sort of a real world example of

1369
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,039
the principal lease privilege.

1370
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:47,429
You don't really need someone to be able to create IM

1371
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,639
roles to be able to launch auto

1372
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,728
mode instances, just that instance profile.

1373
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:54,250
And so if you, if you're in an

1374
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,250
organization where there is very careful sort of

1375
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,269
attention paid to the permissions that different

1376
00:47:58,269 --> 00:47:59,750
users or personas get.

1377
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,119
Um, this will be a great feature that will make it that much

1378
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,329
easier to get started with auto mode. You won't have to go ask your security

1379
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:06,449
team for permissions they're gonna wanna, you

1380
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:08,398
know, maybe think twice about giving you.

1381
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:10,668
Instead, the very simple instance profile

1382
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:11,889
is a great way to

1383
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:13,208
to work around that.

1384
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,219
These features are, I think, fundamentally

1385
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:18,360
a reflection of our commitment to

1386
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,969
security by default, which Auto mode has had since its

1387
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:23,219
launch through the choice of bottle rocket, its operating

1388
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,648
system and various other sort of security enhancements

1389
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,978
that Autoode has, and we hope that it helps

1390
00:48:27,978 --> 00:48:30,019
give you the tools that you need to meet your own

1391
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:31,418
security and compliance requirements.

1392
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:35,719
So the last group of features that we

1393
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:37,840
have here are around the capacity itself, so

1394
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,639
like the instances in your cluster.

1395
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:42,559
While Auto mode's dynamic capacity

1396
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,219
management powered by Carpenter

1397
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,958
is perfect for a lot of workloads, there

1398
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,119
are absolutely scenarios that require more

1399
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,148
predictable or reserved capacity.

1400
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:53,510
So that's why we've added these two important

1401
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,878
features around how Automode handles

1402
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:56,840
capacity management.

1403
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:59,849
So first, Automo can now prioritize

1404
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:02,309
reserve capacity, so on-demand capacity

1405
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,708
reservations or capacity blocks for ML,

1406
00:49:05,628 --> 00:49:07,869
which will help increase the cost efficiency of your

1407
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:09,929
existing investments in these

1408
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:11,978
these kind of like pre-purchased

1409
00:49:11,978 --> 00:49:13,989
options. You can configure this

1410
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:16,438
using this new sort of stanza

1411
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,780
in the you'll recognize a theme

1412
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,909
here around terms, new stanza in the node class

1413
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:22,628
capacity reservation selector terms.

1414
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,208
This lets you target very flexibly

1415
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,208
reservations by ID or via

1416
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:27,829
tag

1417
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,679
and will let auto mode say,

1418
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:33,188
hey, if I can fulfill the

1419
00:49:33,188 --> 00:49:35,659
compute needs for a workload using reserve capacity,

1420
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:38,059
it'll always try to do that first rather than spinning up

1421
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,769
an on-demand or spot instance, for example.

1422
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,869
So I mentioned auto mode

1423
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:44,889
by default has this very kind of dynamic and

1424
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,469
flexible compute management model powered by Carpenter,

1425
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:50,010
but not all workloads need that kind of

1426
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:50,869
dynamism,

1427
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:53,208
and for that we've introduced a feature

1428
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,769
we're calling static capacity.

1429
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,590
So this is a very different style feature.

1430
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,090
This makes capacity management in automode work very

1431
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,949
differently than it does by default in that

1432
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,369
you can tell us that you want to tell Aomode

1433
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,530
that you want to have a

1434
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,708
set number of instances always running.

1435
00:50:09,128 --> 00:50:11,128
Regardless of how many pods are in the cluster

1436
00:50:11,128 --> 00:50:13,409
or how many pods are pending, which is typically how

1437
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:15,610
new instances come into an auto mode cluster,

1438
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,769
this allows you to pre-provision capacity

1439
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:19,349
independently

1440
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:20,579
from

1441
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,090
the workloads in your cluster and will ensure that

1442
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,090
you always have the resources you need for

1443
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,159
mission critical applications or those that

1444
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,148
simply just don't need to auto scale.

1445
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,809
Um, I think these features give you a lot more

1446
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,889
control over how auto mode manages

1447
00:50:33,889 --> 00:50:35,929
capacity and maintains all

1448
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:38,289
of the operational benefits that you get from auto mode,

1449
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:40,889
you know, obviously helps you optimize for both performance

1450
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:43,228
costs and your team's time, which is really critical.

1451
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:46,360
So You know, as we

1452
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:46,958
wrap up,

1453
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:49,418
I, I wanna leave you with a few key takeaways

1454
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:51,599
from our journey today and uh

1455
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,840
through EKS Auto mode and, and kind of what it means for

1456
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
how we think Kuberne's operations

1457
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,938
looks in the future,

1458
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:58,789
so. First,

1459
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:01,340
Auto mode is a fundamental shift in how we think

1460
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,780
about operating Kubernetes.

1461
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:05,418
While 93% of organizations are using

1462
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:07,659
or evaluating Kubernetes, the

1463
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:09,739
operational complexity can be a significant challenge.

1464
00:51:10,059 --> 00:51:12,239
Um, EKS Autoode allows you to move

1465
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,039
from manual,

1466
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,579
complex cluster management, that that pain on

1467
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,688
the the the the maze slide in in dance

1468
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:18,438
section,

1469
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,938
um, to a fully automated AWS

1470
00:51:20,938 --> 00:51:22,708
managed cluster infrastructure.

1471
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,579
Second, this isn't just about reducing

1472
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:27,418
operational overhead, it's about enabling innovation.

1473
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:30,079
As Dan told us, when your platform teams

1474
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,090
aren't constantly firefighting infrastructure

1475
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,449
issues, they can focus on what really matters building

1476
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:36,449
features that drive value for your business

1477
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:38,530
and help, help you and the rest of your

1478
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,269
organization innovate.

1479
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:40,280
Third,

1480
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:42,969
Automa maintains the power and flexibility of

1481
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:45,570
Kubernetes while drastically simplifying

1482
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:46,429
its complexity.

1483
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:49,449
You still get full access to the entire Kubernes

1484
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:51,438
ecosystem. Autoode's Kubernetes conform it.

1485
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,889
Anything that you can do in Kubernetes, you can do in auto

1486
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:54,668
mode, um.

1487
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:57,458
But you just simply don't have to bear the burden of that

1488
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,039
heavy operational lift

1489
00:51:59,668 --> 00:52:01,699
because it's Kubernis is important, all of those tools

1490
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:03,079
continue to work seamlessly.

1491
00:52:03,478 --> 00:52:04,059
Finally,

1492
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:06,679
enterprise requirements don't have to mean

1493
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:07,519
operational complexity.

1494
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,289
Automode is ready to meet your security, compliance,

1495
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,340
and performance needs while keeping things

1496
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,860
simple.

1497
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:15,219
Whether you're just starting on your Kubernetes journey

1498
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,199
or looking to modernize your existing platform,

1499
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,019
Autode, give Automode a shot and tell us

1500
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:22,059
how you think how it works out for you, and I

1501
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,458
think you'll experience what we've been discussing here firsthand.

1502
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:26,969
Thank you all so much. Thank you, Cy, Dan,

1503
00:52:27,148 --> 00:52:28,869
uh, and enjoy the rest of your reinvent.

1504
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:30,228
Thank you. Thanks.
