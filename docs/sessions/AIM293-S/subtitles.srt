1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,209
OK, I just got the thumbs up, so we're gonna go

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,599
ahead and get started.

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,089
So hello everybody. Thanks

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,889
so much for being here today.

5
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:09,028
Really appreciate,

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,849
um, yeah, I mean it's Thursday

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,038
afternoon after what has been kind of a marathon week,

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,489
so I appreciate you hanging on till the end.

9
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,929
Uh, my name is Cameron Stewart, and we are

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,068
here to talk about reimagining software development

11
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:22,940
and DevOps with Agentic AI.

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,149
Um, so without further ado, let's go ahead and get started.

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,638
So what we have on deck today is we're

14
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,760
going to do a bit of a refresher of

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,819
what DevOps is. It's actually feels like it's

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,319
been a few years since DevOps was like

17
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,679
one of the hot new buzzwords. It feels like everything's

18
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,779
agentic and LLMs these days.

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,039
So just a quick refresher, trip

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,060
down memory lane,

21
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,598
um, and then we're gonna talk about the tools and technology that we're

22
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:48,779
using today, how we're empowering developers

23
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:51,079
to, uh, move faster, to generate

24
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,399
code faster, and then we're gonna talk about the other

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,759
tools that help support and make that all possible,

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,740
that throughput.

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
So that's what we have in store. Let's

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,478
go ahead and dive in.

29
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:03,090
I think I first wanna start with what DevOps

30
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,880
is not.

31
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:06,370
So often people conflate DevOps with

32
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,099
a tech stack,

33
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,698
tools, right? DevOps is not tools,

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,769
it's not YAML files, it's not pipelines.

35
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,180
At its core, DevOps is an ethos,

36
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,260
it's a philosophy.

37
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,939
DevOps arose in response to dysfunction.

38
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,879
Because we had disparate teams that had different

39
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,099
incentives and KPIs. We had devs

40
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,219
that were focusing on velocity and getting features out the

41
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,439
door fast. We had ops that was responsible

42
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:28,888
or rely, um,

43
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,540
was responsible for reliability and making

44
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,819
sure that things were available. We had

45
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,338
security that was responsible for,

46
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,000
well, keeping things secure. And then we had

47
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,599
testing. And quality,

48
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,058
um, and QA that was just responsible for quality

49
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,680
and maintainability all up. But so these were all

50
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,980
different teams that were using different tool

51
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,049
sets and everything was fragmented and siloed. And

52
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,058
so that dysfunction, that bred

53
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:53,120
dysfunction, and that dysfunction

54
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:53,959
bred

55
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,359
longer release times and broken

56
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,599
feedback loops and slowed things

57
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,010
down. And if we think about

58
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,250
kind of the early literature of

59
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,329
the DevOps movement, we think about

60
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,650
books like The Phoenix Project and Lean

61
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,349
Thinking,

62
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,889
those were really going back and relying on the principles

63
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,610
of manufacturing. And if you think about a factory

64
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,770
floor and how smoothly things need

65
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,689
to run. A,

66
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,758
um, just a, uh, delay in any

67
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:22,469
one specific step along that

68
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,860
process causes a delay throughout the entire system.

69
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,159
And so what it was focusing on was optimizing the

70
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,278
system of a as a whole and not

71
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:31,088
just focusing on a single component.

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,979
And so it's applying those same principles

73
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,399
to software development, to the SDLC software development

74
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,479
life cycle. We need to optimize

75
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,558
the system as a whole. We need to give teams

76
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,683
common tools. Of practices about

77
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:43,463
our culture

78
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:46,304
so that there's not a culture of of blame

79
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:48,444
that it's kind of shared collaboration shared

80
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:50,564
incentives and so that's

81
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:52,694
really what DevOps is is the union

82
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,534
of people,

83
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:56,163
process, and technology to continuously deliver

84
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,504
value to end users

85
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,883
because of course technology did

86
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:02,344
arise right to support these

87
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,524
principles and this philosophy like I said

88
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:05,985
to support this culture

89
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:07,429
you know. You know, we did

90
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,028
see things like

91
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,558
CICD and IAC

92
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,649
and GitOps like arise,

93
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:14,429
but those

94
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:15,349
weren't

95
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,129
what DevOps was.

96
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,250
They came or they arose because DevOps

97
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,889
demanded reliability,

98
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,288
repeatability, faster iteration cycles.

99
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,409
Those are the things that we needed, and so we

100
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,649
had to come up with the technology to

101
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:29,788
support these

102
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,909
processes.

103
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,854
Because you can still have pipelines

104
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:36,675
and be deploying to code and using Kubernetes

105
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:39,493
and that's not DevOps if developers

106
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,713
can't deploy

107
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:43,493
frequently, if there's still committee

108
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,574
or change by committee, and

109
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:47,694
if there's still kind of broken cycles in

110
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,993
there, that's not DevOps. So it's really a combination

111
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:52,085
of the culture, the philosophy, and then of course

112
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,133
there are technologies that come together to support

113
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,933
and underpin all of that.

114
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,788
And so I do wanna address the elephant

115
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,830
in the room. It feels like this gets this topic

116
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,830
is being brought up more and more these

117
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,949
days. The first elephant in the room that I want to acknowledge

118
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,020
is that Thomas Domka sadly is

119
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,149
no longer the CEO of GitHub, so formally

120
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,229
known as, uh, CEO of

121
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,270
GitHub. But one thing that Thomas always talked

122
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,059
about was we will always need

123
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,189
developers. Developers are going nowhere, even in this

124
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,230
day and age where agentic AI

125
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,750
and co-generation tools are,

126
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,259
you know, are in the future, you know, could be generating upwards

127
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,488
of 90% of. The code the developers are

128
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,189
writing, it could be written by AI,

129
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,869
but that 10% is still so

130
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,988
important, and developers will stay in

131
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,028
the loop. Developers are going nowhere. They're needed

132
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:38,470
now more than ever, and that doesn't just apply

133
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,629
to the human developers. That applies to

134
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,988
the fundamentals, the little things

135
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:45,350
using small batch PRs, linters,

136
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,988
code scanners, code review.

137
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:49,588
None of that goes away. All of that becomes even

138
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,588
more important in this day and age where

139
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,689
we're generating code at such a fast

140
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:54,389
clip.

141
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,298
But in the kind of before times,

142
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,129
even before

143
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,829
generative AI tools were around, developers

144
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:04,829
were only spending a fraction

145
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,829
of their time writing code. There's

146
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,869
so many, so other still so many

147
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:11,048
other concerns that they were focusing on in terms

148
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:11,608
of

149
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,778
debugging, testing, going to meetings, coordinating,

150
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,988
making sure. That the software was flowing

151
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:17,809
through the system

152
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,309
easily because again if we go back to those

153
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,309
manufacturing principles, that's what DevOps

154
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,290
is all about

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,750
how can we allow maximum throughput? How

156
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,970
can we allow software to flow through the system

157
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,189
with minimal friction and obstacles along the

158
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,269
way? That's ultimately what we're trying to achieve at the end

159
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:33,809
of the day.

160
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,988
And so going back to, you know, developers were only

161
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:39,209
spending a small part of their time actually coding,

162
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,230
but there were all these other concerns that they

163
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,470
were also having to focus on.

164
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,319
And that even gets magnified

165
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,338
in this day and age when they're

166
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,420
being when they're able to offload kind of the

167
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,488
writing of the code to these other

168
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,858
tools because when we're generating

169
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,939
so much code at again such a

170
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,939
fast clip there's so many

171
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,139
other pillars of the SDLC that are

172
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,220
still just as important and if

173
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,459
we don't have the processes in

174
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,579
place to support all these

175
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,420
other aspects of the SDLC.

176
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:12,220
All of kind of this, um,

177
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,399
you know, innovation that we can realize with AI is just gonna

178
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,338
become complexity very, very quickly

179
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
and so if we think about kind of the pipeline or the hose,

180
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,600
if we're starting at the front end and just allowing developers

181
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,678
to just generate codes so fast

182
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,759
and it's rocket fuel and they're innovating and they're pumping

183
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,420
out features like never before,

184
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,678
but the rest of your process isn't able

185
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:30,509
to support that,

186
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,920
that's gonna become a bottleneck and again that's

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,858
what the whole

188
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,500
manufacturing principles. And DevOps, um,

189
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,639
you know, arose from is to remove those

190
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,899
bottlenecks because it'll stress the entire

191
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,139
system. So we can't just focus on the

192
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,220
beginning of the pipeline or really the kind of the middle

193
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,250
of the pipeline. Let's just generate a bunch of code really

194
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,259
fast. Now we have to think about the

195
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,319
rest of the process.

196
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,769
And so now I think we're really moving from,

197
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,059
you know, we're in the age of, yes, you can generate code

198
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,259
very, very quickly, and there's a lot of it being

199
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,678
generated at amazing speeds.

200
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,338
But now the process that we need to focus on

201
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,059
is verification and validation.

202
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,420
Now we need to make sure that that code is secure,

203
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,819
that it, um, adheres and complies

204
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,048
with governance standards,

205
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,420
that it has all of the guardrails in

206
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,428
place so that we can have an automatic

207
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:16,309
flow through

208
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:17,298
the system.

209
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,290
Because if we think about it,

210
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,129
when we kind of arrived in the AI era,

211
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:24,108
that was like

212
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,689
just being excited that we had a car.

213
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,129
Now we have an F1 engine, but we need to make

214
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,439
sure that we have everything else in place to

215
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,480
support being able to go at this pace and

216
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,119
at this speed. We need to make sure that we have brakes,

217
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,488
steering. I mean, seat belts. Come on, we

218
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:39,910
have to make sure that we're gonna stay safe.

219
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,329
And so that's all, those are all the other concerns that

220
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,329
now we have to kind of focus on now that we're

221
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,269
able to go this fast.

222
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,608
So let's talk about if we think

223
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,608
about kind of that front end of the pipeline

224
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,730
like let's talk about the tools that are working that are actually

225
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,730
helping developers to generate this

226
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,500
code. So

227
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,290
if we think about kind of the evolution

228
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,699
of generative AI and the tools that we're

229
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,939
working with, you can think of it and

230
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:07,338
across a couple of different areas. We're gonna look at the scope of changes,

231
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,178
the frequency of the interaction,

232
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,540
the inner versus the outer loop, and

233
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,699
the developer canvas. And

234
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,389
so, you know,

235
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:18,100
GitHub released, uh, co-pilot in 2022,

236
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,220
which is a year before Chachi BT

237
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,819
came out, which is kind of crazy to think.

238
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,428
Um, and it was so novel, right, to have coke

239
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:26,449
inflationss at your fingertips. Now you could

240
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,629
just have your thought kind of finished for

241
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,709
you, or you could have conversational chat

242
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,729
where you didn't have to go to Stack Overflow or Google

243
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,788
to answer your question. You just had it right there

244
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:36,590
in your IDE. That was amazing,

245
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:37,950
really changed the game.

246
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,418
And so what we were seeing was like

247
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,938
co-pilot was really good again that co-completion

248
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,967
those next few lines and

249
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,979
when we first uh released co-pilot

250
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,457
we called it your AI pair

251
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,499
programmer. And if anyone is familiar with kind

252
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,538
of how pair programming works, it's that

253
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:55,597
it's two developers, one keyboard,

254
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,389
one monitor. Both working on the problem

255
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,548
together, super helpful to have that extra

256
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,729
set of eyes there to be like, oh, that's a typo.

257
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,109
Oh, here's, here's the syntax for how you'd wanna

258
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,149
finish that function.

259
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,469
Co-pilot was that, you know, it didn't have to be

260
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,469
a human sitting next to you. Now you could catch

261
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,519
your typos and finish your thought and tell you how to

262
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,590
finish that function definition or what the next function

263
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,308
needed to be.

264
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,830
And so that was really helpful to have that again just

265
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,590
kind of at your,

266
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,109
your uh fingertips and that experience needed to

267
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,109
be really snappy really fast. We wanted to have it

268
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,190
in real time. It really was kind of finishing

269
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,808
your thought as you were actually typing

270
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,609
and this was again focused on the inner loop and this largely

271
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,629
the surface that you were interacting with was your editor,

272
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,710
whether that was VS code or others, but

273
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,859
you were working in your IDE.

274
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,000
Then we kind of evolved to

275
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,580
having conversational chat, being able to make edits

276
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,859
across multiple files. Again, this experience

277
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,428
still largely lived within the IDE,

278
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,558
um, and still focusing on the inner loop, and

279
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:49,580
this maybe though kind of expanded

280
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,590
the amount of time that it took because some of

281
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,788
the reasoning was deeper. You were asking bigger

282
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:56,460
questions. It took a little bit more cognitive load

283
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:57,759
and so this might now,

284
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,139
um, you know, range on the, uh, order of

285
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,229
magnitude of seconds to get a response to you and your

286
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:04,399
IDE. Then we,

287
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,519
you know, really kind of change the game and we get

288
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,599
to where we're actually handing off entire tasks

289
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,639
to 8. It's not just focusing on a

290
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,788
specific like, here's this box of code.

291
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,259
I wanna be able to do this again.

292
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,719
Can you do that for me? Now we're saying, hey,

293
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:18,879
I have this new component I wanna make or I have this

294
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,109
new feature I wanna implement.

295
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:23,119
Can you write that feature for me and

296
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,019
create a new

297
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:26,548
branch, push it to it, and create a PR

298
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,298
and get up for me?

299
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,019
And the agent can do that and it's incredible

300
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,210
what you can hand off to agent

301
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,538
to an agent and but of

302
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:37,080
course, you know, again this is a little bit more computation

303
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,479
that requires and so now we're working on the order

304
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,960
of magnitude of minutes

305
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,259
still focusing on the inner loop and this was still living.

306
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,038
Within the IDE

307
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,690
and of course obviously

308
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,269
I work at GitHub so I'm gonna talk about co-pilot a lot,

309
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:50,469
but you can kind of insert your favorite tool

310
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,250
here. We're not the only player in the game anymore

311
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,678
and there's lots of tools out there that can do this code

312
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:56,750
completions, conversational chat agents

313
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,908
that can work a little bit more autonomously.

314
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,820
And so now kind of the next evolution

315
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,960
and what I get really excited to talk about

316
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,719
is when we talk about things like

317
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,009
coding agents and so within the GitHub

318
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,099
ecosystem what this looks like is what

319
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,750
we call co-pilot coding agents

320
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,139
and what this uh does is that

321
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,178
you can take an entire issue and you can

322
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,379
hand it to the co-pilot coding agent

323
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,298
and it'll parse the body of that issue,

324
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,899
understand what it is you're trying, like the work

325
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,279
that you're describing, what it is you're trying to accomplish,

326
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,700
and it will. Go to work

327
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,080
and you can assign whole tasks

328
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,279
to co-pilot whether that's increasing

329
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,440
test coverage, writing unit tests. I

330
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,739
wanna implement dark mode on my UI,

331
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,320
um, you know, you can do all kinds of things

332
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,460
that you can hand off to the co-pilot coding

333
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:42,369
agents

334
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,320
and initially we started with GitHub

335
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,639
issues because, you know, we're gonna start within the ecosystem

336
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,639
that we know and love, but we've continued to evolve

337
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,719
where you can actually interact with and

338
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,979
assign things to. Pilot coding agent.

339
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,658
So now you can do it from, um, Azure DevOps

340
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,259
boards. You can do it from Linear.

341
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:01,580
Coming soon. You're gonna be able to do it from Jira. You can

342
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,639
even do it from Slack.

343
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,940
It's pretty impactful to be able to hand an

344
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
entire task off to co-pilot

345
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,678
coding agent

346
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:10,519
because what this does, this is completely asynchronous.

347
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,038
You can hand, you can assign co-pilot coding agent

348
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,158
5 issues, and then you can

349
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,279
go to a meeting,

350
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,729
go to lunch, go pick up your kids, go to bed,

351
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,899
whatever it is, go do whatever else you need

352
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,940
to do. And then you can come

353
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,029
back to 5 draft PRs.

354
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,460
It's pretty incredible.

355
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,840
And maybe co-pilot doesn't get

356
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,178
it 100% of the 100%

357
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,200
right 100% of the time, but when

358
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,529
it does do it in one shot, you feel pretty powerful.

359
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,149
You're like, huh,

360
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,599
I didn't even have to fix that bug. I didn't even have to look at

361
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,229
that bug. Co-pilot

362
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,038
knew what the description of the bug was, was

363
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,038
able to parse the issue,

364
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,519
generated the fix, ran tests to make sure

365
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,219
everything was secure, and now we're good to go.

366
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:51,109
So these are the types of tools that you can

367
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,349
use that can help to automate

368
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,349
this flow of software through the system. This

369
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:57,428
is just one example again we're kind of focusing on the

370
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,788
beginning of the pipeline. This is helping developers

371
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,210
generate code rapidly

372
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,690
and you know, developers are getting a little bit more

373
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,908
hands off in the scenario which we'll talk about more

374
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:06,808
um in just a bit.

375
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,989
And so this really is kind of the shift that

376
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,250
we're seeing when we, we started with,

377
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,710
you know, code completions and then conversational

378
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,109
chat, but now we're really moving from assistants

379
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,308
to agents. I mentioned that when we first

380
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:21,369
released co-pilot, we called it the, uh, AI

381
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,908
pair programmer.

382
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,259
Now what we're kind of referring it to with the

383
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,428
rise of things like co-pilot coding agent, it's

384
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:28,928
your peer programmer.

385
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,509
You can actually hand entire issues to it like it was a junior

386
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,250
dev on your team,

387
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,629
and so it's less a tool and

388
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,629
more, you know, something that's that can act more

389
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:37,548
autonomously.

390
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,259
So we're helping to, you know, evolve from

391
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,279
passive agents to more autonomous

392
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,859
or passive helpers, excuse me, to autonomous agents.

393
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,070
So let's uh take a look at what that looks

394
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,460
like. I wanna show you, um,

395
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,629
co-pilot coding agents. Give me just a

396
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,830
second here. We're gonna switch on over.

397
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:56,149
OK, there we are.

398
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,668
Um, welcome to GitHub. I have

399
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,729
this, uh, repository,

400
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,369
which is kind of like a logistics app

401
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,325
and. And

402
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,594
um, I have a number of issues

403
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:07,575
here of

404
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,913
things that I can work on. So

405
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,114
we can take a look at a couple of these, um,

406
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:14,394
you know, explore using a green color palette,

407
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,224
page navigation and keyboard shortcuts,

408
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:19,065
um, performance optimizations,

409
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,844
add autocomplete suggestions for the search bar.

410
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,580
Um, let me, we will start with this

411
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,658
good first issue. The navigating

412
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,320
to the help center page doesn't redirect.

413
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,889
So again, this is a GitHub issue,

414
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,259
but it doesn't have to be. This can be a linear ticket.

415
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:34,298
This could be a JR ticket. This can be, you know, you

416
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,158
can describe this from Slack,

417
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,460
um, but we have the details and the issue here. The user

418
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,000
should be redirected to the help center page

419
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,879
when they select it from the bottom. Bottom menu

420
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,340
and then we have a nice screenshot here

421
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,710
and that's all that's in the issue so it's not

422
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,989
um all that verbose but it is

423
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,149
nice. I mean it's pretty straightforward in terms of what we're trying

424
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,190
to fix the screenshot's super helpful and

425
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,279
so what I can do is I'm just gonna go

426
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,009
ahead and assign this to co-pilot

427
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,509
and because so I can optionally

428
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,759
add another prompt where this is. Targeting,

429
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:05,879
you know, which repository do you want to target? This is the one

430
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,570
we're already working in, so I'm gonna stay there.

431
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,308
We'll talk more about this later, but you don't,

432
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,440
you also have the ability to assign

433
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,599
it to other custom agents. We'll

434
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,639
talk more about custom agents in a little bit, so I'm not

435
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,879
gonna touch that for now. I'm not really gonna add

436
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,359
anything. I think that the issue is good enough as is,

437
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,580
and so I'm just gonna go ahead and assign it.

438
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,090
And so that's gonna kick off this whole process.

439
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,330
Now co-pilot is an assignee. We'll see, we'll watch

440
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,359
it for just a second, because you can see here that I

441
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,908
assigned co-pilot this.

442
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,570
And what it's going to do is it's going to start a draft

443
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,129
PR.

444
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,349
And in this PR.

445
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,869
It's going to say, hey,

446
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,080
thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm gonna start working on

447
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,279
it. I'll keep this PR's description up to

448
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,639
date. It'll actually post back as it makes,

449
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,759
uh, changes and kind of goes through it, does its

450
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,918
thing, um, and it'll

451
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,418
kind of, yeah, keep you updated there.

452
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,940
Now I wanted to kick this off because this will take.

453
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,219
Maybe 10 minutes or so

454
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,139
we'll see depending conference Wi Fi, you know,

455
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,500
uh, so we're gonna, we'll come back to that so we're gonna let

456
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,759
that kind of cook for a bit and in the meantime

457
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,080
let's go to VS code

458
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,460
and talk about um some of the other ways

459
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,279
and some of the other tools that developers,

460
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,774
uh, have at their. Proposal in order to help

461
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,075
them, you know, generate code and so

462
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,533
again I'm a BS code. I'm gonna be working with a

463
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,614
co-pilot and so one

464
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,423
thing that I have is, um,

465
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:26,894
again this is a logistics page and you can also

466
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:29,375
do like a shopping cart thing or you can add items

467
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,570
you can. Add items

468
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,808
to a shopping cart, but we don't actually have a shopping

469
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,969
shopping cart page at this

470
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:38,129
time to display the items, so I wanna help

471
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,090
have co-pilot help me with that.

472
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,629
So I'm going to say can.

473
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,529
You help me

474
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:48,469
create a shopping

475
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,908
cart page.

476
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,830
And use the, I

477
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,710
have

478
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:58,070
a screenshot or an image of what

479
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,369
I want it to look like

480
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,950
as a reference. And so what

481
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,150
I'm doing here, so a couple of things, because

482
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,229
again this is I just kind of kicked this off, this is gonna cook

483
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:06,750
for a minute.

484
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,410
One thing to call out, I'm working in

485
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,430
agent mode and so with, by

486
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,588
the way, can everyone see this OK? Do you need me to bump up the font

487
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:14,709
or anything? We're good? OK.

488
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,708
Um, with VS code you

489
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,788
have a couple of different modes that come out of

490
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,788
the box. Initially we started just with

491
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:24,148
ask and then we added edit and then agent,

492
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,708
and then we recently made plan available

493
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,708
because you also have the ability to create custom

494
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,898
chat modes and the custom chat mode

495
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,229
that literally everyone was creating and putting in

496
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:35,409
their, uh, repositories was a plan mode

497
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,459
and so we're like. Well this just makes a lot of

498
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,578
sense and everyone wants to use this, so

499
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,680
we're just gonna put this out of the box MVS code

500
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,239
so you can kind of target which mode

501
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,338
you're interacting with. I find the agent mode

502
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,500
is probably the one that I'm

503
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,880
working with the most unless I'm specifically

504
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,059
working on a plan where I'm not trying to generate any

505
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,608
code. I'm just kind of in that ideation brainstorming

506
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,578
phase, and then I'll work on plan mode.

507
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,189
Uh, but you can see that I also have another

508
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,318
list, and these all correspond to other,

509
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,719
uh, custom agents that I have defined

510
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,989
within my repository.

511
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,390
Now how you do custom, um,

512
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,750
customizations with co-pilot, um,

513
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,828
at the repo level is using

514
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:14,118
the construct of this dot GitHub,

515
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,828
um, directory. And so within that

516
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:19,219
directory, you can see that I have actions, agents,

517
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,305
chat modes. Instructions, models, prompts, we have

518
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,473
a whole bunch of things in here.

519
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,305
And so I have these custom agents which are defined.

520
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,545
We can see API specialists, TDD green,

521
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,943
TDD red. We have a couple of custom agents

522
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,305
here. You'll notice that that then corresponds

523
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,045
with the custom agents that I see here.

524
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,703
So again, you can kind of target these custom agents

525
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,743
if you have a specific task that you're working

526
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,755
on. We'll go deeper into custom agents a little

527
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,864
bit later, but I just wanted to call that out since you can.

528
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:45,578
See them there and we're wondering what if you were wondering

529
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:46,430
what those were.

530
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,910
So if we go back to

531
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,410
co-pilot, we can see that a number of things have

532
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,650
happened. So first it's, um,

533
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:55,809
you know, saying let me examine the existing

534
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,930
front end structure to understand the

535
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,848
current issue. You can see,

536
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,328
um, you know, what it's using for reference. It's using

537
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:03,910
a custom instructions file,

538
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,449
um, you can see, you know, the files that it's

539
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,640
reading to understand the repository structure

540
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,029
and how the codebase is functioning.

541
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,430
Um, it's gonna check if there's a cart

542
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,588
context already and look at the

543
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,689
color theme.

544
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:18,348
Now let me create a comprehensive shopping

545
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:19,549
cart implementation.

546
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,910
It's telling me what I'm, what it's going to

547
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,309
create. It's going to create a cart context

548
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,098
to manage the cart cart state,

549
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,890
cart page component.

550
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:30,239
Um, it's going to update the,

551
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,670
um, file to include the cart route,

552
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,750
and it's going to update the products component

553
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,750
to use the cart context.

554
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,623
So it has a number of things. Again, it's gonna kind of. Continue

555
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:41,642
to work, but you can see here that I'm

556
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,811
handing co-pilot an entire task. Implement this

557
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:45,962
functionality for me, and it's gonna make changes

558
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,083
across multiple files.

559
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:49,343
Right now we can see up here it's already,

560
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:52,093
um, created and is working on those

561
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,192
two files. So that's super

562
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,242
helpful that it's kind of again working on

563
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,771
that now while co-pilot

564
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,962
agent mode is working, you know, of

565
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,962
course there's other things that I can be doing, but

566
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:04,972
it really has kind of monopolized my IDE

567
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,202
session for this particular task. I'm waiting

568
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,714
for it to complete. It's output

569
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,056
and that's really what I, we're gonna pop back over

570
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:13,115
and we're gonna check on how our,

571
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,796
uh, coding agent is doing,

572
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,134
um, because what I love about handing off to the

573
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,175
co-pilot coding agent is that it really does feel

574
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,336
like so much more of a handoff. I'm not

575
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,415
quite as involved sitting next to it waiting for it

576
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:25,494
to do its work. I'm just completely saying,

577
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,615
hey, you go take care of this and I'll be back to check

578
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:28,195
on you

579
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,615
when you're done, honestly, um, but

580
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:32,615
we can see that it has indeed kind

581
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:34,655
of updated the body of the PR now

582
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:36,634
it's created a plan and it's working.

583
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,068
Uh, it created a list of steps that it's going

584
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,309
to work through, and it's already done two of those.

585
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,410
So same thing,

586
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,949
I'm gonna pop in to kind of

587
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,150
check on the co-pilot coding agent, what

588
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,180
we call a session.

589
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,529
So we have this button here that I can view

590
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,588
session, and what this is gonna do.

591
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,358
So this is going to take me into

592
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:57,439
co-pilot's session and so

593
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,640
we can kind of see from the beginning. First thing it does, it's

594
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,818
gonna check out the code. It's gonna set up node

595
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:04,039
and it's gonna start both the GitHub and the Playwright

596
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,199
MCP servers. Now those ones are loaded

597
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,338
by default, but you can also have your own

598
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,719
MCP server definition if you want the

599
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,838
coding agent to use a specific tool or

600
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,920
to use a specific, specific MCP

601
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,000
server, you can configure that. So these are just

602
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,910
the two that are on by default out of the box,

603
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:19,880
but you can definitely.

604
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,939
A more customizes as you,

605
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:24,279
um, as your, you know, need kind of,

606
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,449
uh, requires.

607
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,979
So same thing like co-pilot takes kind of a

608
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,259
very, uh, similar path with both of these

609
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,328
is I'll start by exploring the repository

610
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:34,459
structure, understand the code base, locate

611
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,739
the relevant files for this navigation issue,

612
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,588
um, you know, goes through those various files.

613
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,989
Now let me explore the front end.

614
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Let me examine the footer component and

615
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,779
the app routing structure. You can see the files

616
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:46,939
it looks at for that.

617
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:50,039
Now let me check to see if there's a help center component

618
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,500
or if there's a page for that already created.

619
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,670
Now, let me check. It's going to look at our package JSON

620
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,170
and it's going to understand the build and test setup.

621
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,828
It's going to look at the dependencies.

622
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:03,269
Um, all right, now I understand

623
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,509
the issue. The help center link and the footer

624
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,779
component is just using an HRF

625
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,229
that doesn't navigate anywhere.

626
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,670
So, again, kind of our plan, what we need

627
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,910
to do. Um, so co-pilot's

628
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,449
making good progress here.

629
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,150
Um, we're going to update the footer

630
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,130
to use RA's router link.

631
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,439
Uh, we're gonna run the project. The build succeeded.

632
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,559
OK, so co-pilot is still working

633
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,680
here, but these are examples of kind of two different

634
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,759
ways that you're using, that you're interacting or you're

635
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,078
having an agenttic experience. One is in the IDE,

636
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,140
and that's leveraging agent mode. And again,

637
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:36,358
this is just co-pilot specific, but there's other

638
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:38,259
tools out there that give you the very similar,

639
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,759
you know, agent experiences or agenttic

640
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,469
experiences.

641
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,479
Uh, the other is by leveraging

642
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,660
another tool, co-pilot coding agent, that you can

643
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,920
lob something off entirely to

644
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,930
delegate that. Responsibility to and

645
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,049
it'll just work in the background. The output

646
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:55,049
spoiler alert is gonna be that we're

647
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,049
gonna get a PR with all of this work completed

648
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,088
for us to review. And so like I

649
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:01,328
said, we'll see, you know, we'll

650
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:03,328
see what it looks like and how good of a job it did

651
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:05,769
and maybe co-pilot doesn't get it in one shot every time,

652
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,170
but it at least gets you pretty far, maybe

653
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,209
80% of the way there, and that gets you

654
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:11,910
a great place to at least

655
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:14,400
now it's a good jumping off place and you didn't have

656
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,469
to start from there. So we're really empowering

657
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:18,630
developers to move very, very quickly here.

658
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:21,729
All right, let's pop over, um,

659
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:23,779
to back to the PowerPoint while these things kind

660
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,078
of finish.

661
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,890
And kind of continue to talk about co-pilot coding

662
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,049
agent because now I do wanna talk about it in

663
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,130
kind of more of a real use case because

664
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,289
that's adorable little demo scenario that I have

665
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,368
cooked up here but let's talk about something a little

666
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,769
more production grade.

667
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,640
So internally,

668
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,578
uh, we at GitHub

669
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,469
use GitHub to build GitHub.

670
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:45,118
It's turtles all the way down.

671
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,140
Um, everyone at GitHub uses GitHub sales

672
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,930
folks,

673
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,229
marketing folks,

674
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:53,019
everything lives in an issue. We track call logs

675
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,140
and out of office requests and GitHub issues that we use

676
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,759
the platform,

677
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,358
um, for more things than it was designed, honestly,

678
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,739
uh, but this doesn't stop at just the platform itself.

679
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,180
It also, you know, extends to the AI

680
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,358
tools that we're also building and so. Our internal

681
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:06,019
teams,

682
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,279
uh, use co-pilot coding agent

683
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,799
extensively. In fact,

684
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,838
we use coding agent to help us build

685
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:15,000
coding agent. And during that time, during March,

686
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:16,098
you can kind of see here,

687
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:18,719
it was one of the most productive members of the

688
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:21,160
team. And so it was able to

689
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,318
create new features, but it was also able

690
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:25,390
to address tech debt, which is really,

691
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,660
really incredible

692
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,739
because like

693
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,078
as GitHub we get an inane

694
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:32,140
amount of features. Request. I know that you all can relate to

695
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,630
this as well, but there is just an ever growing backlog,

696
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,920
and it feels like you're never really burning it down,

697
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,739
especially with the really annoying nitpicky stuff

698
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,900
like, you know, that does represent just tech

699
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,519
debt in general.

700
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,818
It's the boring stuff, it's mundane.

701
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
Developers don't wanna work on it. They wanna work on

702
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,259
the shiny new stuff. There's always pressure

703
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,259
to get the new feature that's actually gonna deliver

704
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,500
business value out the door first. There's

705
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,769
constantly this war between like tech debt,

706
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,189
new features. Protect a new feature and new

707
00:24:58,189 --> 00:24:59,059
features win

708
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:00,509
every time

709
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,838
and so you know this can kind of be a bit

710
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:04,880
of a battle in terms of how do we address this

711
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:07,118
and I'll kind of end with this at the end of the

712
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:09,459
talk about um how we're handling

713
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:11,539
this at GitHub, but I just think it's really incredible

714
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
that we're using copilot to do some

715
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,338
of those boring things that developers don't wanna do

716
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,719
and it's allowing us to burn down our

717
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,789
backlog and to be more productive

718
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,640
because we're able to offload this to co-pilot.

719
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,279
And so

720
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,449
in for the um

721
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,479
core GitHub repository whoopsies

722
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,890
um.

723
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,838
You can go in and see that

724
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:34,920
co-pilot coding agent is the #1 contributor

725
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,479
to our core repository that builds GitHub.com.

726
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,318
Which is pretty incredible because it's only been around for a couple

727
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:42,559
of months and right behind it in position

728
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,618
number 3 is a co-pilot code review agent

729
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,098
and so this is having a massive impact to us

730
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:49,118
at GitHub. We're using these tools

731
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:51,318
to really burn down our backlog and to really make commits,

732
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:53,358
and I know this slide looks really pretty and looks like

733
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,559
it's a marketing slide. So I just wanna prove to you that

734
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,799
this is true, and we're just gonna pop over

735
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,880
to, uh, what we affectionately call GitHub GitHub.

736
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,219
This is the core GitHub repository.

737
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,229
You're looking at it,

738
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,818
and if I go to the insights tab.

739
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,979
And we wait for our contributions. You can

740
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:12,019
see top committers is what we're calling

741
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,380
co-pilot Sue agent, which was the internal

742
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,420
code name for co-pilot code agent when it first

743
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
came out. And if I, you know, adjust this

744
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,618
from one week to one month, like this is live actual

745
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:22,789
data, you'll see that the, you know, it does adjust.

746
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:24,199
Here we have co-pilot code review.

747
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,098
So this is what co-pilot looks like actually in the wild.

748
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,170
Like we are using this internally at

749
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,719
GitHub.

750
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:33,769
Alright, so now I wanna switch gears a little

751
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:36,160
bit, um, and talk about some of the other pieces

752
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,328
of the AI infrastructure that kind of support the other

753
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,328
parts of the process. It's not just about developers

754
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:40,868
writing code.

755
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,858
So first, um, in terms

756
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:46,078
of being able to realize the

757
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:48,239
maximum value and to get the most

758
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,279
out of these AI tools, especially these agenttic

759
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,400
tools, as we all know, context

760
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,318
is absolutely everything.

761
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,000
We first learned this with how we would rewrite

762
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,598
our prompts. There was a lot of nuance

763
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:01,719
that could go into what you were asking the tool

764
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,838
to do. And if you could give examples, if you could give

765
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:05,912
a specific format type or an. Output that you

766
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:08,041
wanted to see, you would get better results.

767
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,432
Now this has really widened the scope

768
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,752
of this has really widened from, you know, rag

769
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:15,212
and using other tools to pull an MCP

770
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:17,593
or using MCP to pull in other tools

771
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,873
to pull in context from other systems. I

772
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,021
mean, really the name of the game is how to give the

773
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:24,113
most appropriate and relevant context to the LLM for

774
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:26,311
the particular task at hand that you're trying to

775
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,593
handle and one of the kind of best

776
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:30,625
practices. That we have landed on and

777
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,776
that is widely adopted throughout the industry is custom

778
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,484
instructions

779
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:35,984
and so this is your

780
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:38,265
opportunity to tell co-pilot and other

781
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:40,505
tools how you want a particular

782
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:41,865
task done

783
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,625
and what I think is really um

784
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,066
interesting and where some of this nuance is really starting to come into

785
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,066
play is you know you can use kind

786
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:51,384
of like a top level like we see here

787
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:53,066
again using the dock GitHub directory.

788
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:55,650
Um, just a top level co-pilot instructions file

789
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,709
you can definitely do that. But what becomes even

790
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,789
more interesting is then if you

791
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:01,789
start using instruction files that

792
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,828
only apply to certain languages

793
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:06,189
or frameworks, so if there is,

794
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,588
you know, whatever for all of your CSS files

795
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:10,789
you want one set of custom instructions to apply

796
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,068
to those files, but you want a different

797
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,150
set of custom instruction files to apply to

798
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,049
your playwright tests, for instance,

799
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:19,828
you can use this construct,

800
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,170
that middle construct.

801
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,640
To only apply it to certain file

802
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,680
types and so this is really

803
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,789
important because this not only is

804
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:29,509
um

805
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:32,479
you know, taken into consideration when you're working with

806
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,680
co-pilot in your IDE or when you're working with agent

807
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,160
mode but then when you start to do other agentic

808
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,479
experiences like co-pilot coding agent

809
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,828
or co-pilot code review which we'll talk about, uh,

810
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:44,219
shortly, it will look at these files

811
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:46,375
and pick up. On this, um, and

812
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,654
use this for context so that you can be

813
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:50,233
very specific about

814
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:52,733
how you do things within your organization. What

815
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,074
are your coding standards? What are certain

816
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:57,125
compliance guidelines? How does code need to be

817
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,035
formatted? What does it need to look like,

818
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:01,493
especially when you're doing code review, custom instruction

819
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:03,765
files are gonna be your best friend, and I would highly,

820
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:05,265
highly recommend that everybody

821
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:08,114
use this with every repository.

822
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:10,699
Um, and then just in general if you're just working with

823
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:12,709
top level agents, you know, you can have different

824
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,059
markdown files that guide that

825
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,059
particular agent again on how

826
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,368
you want it to behave.

827
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
So there's lots of kind of customization here.

828
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:22,769
I do want to show you what this, uh, looks

829
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,979
like, so we'll pop back over to VS

830
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:25,598
code.

831
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:29,239
Um, I want to show you

832
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,098
some instructions files.

833
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,009
Um, and so we have different instructions files

834
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,920
for, um, you know, API

835
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:38,630
instructions,

836
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,130
um, and this is for, you know, guidance

837
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,449
for editing and reviewing API code changes.

838
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,848
You can tell it what it applies

839
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,848
to. So again, just within

840
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:50,229
these directories and these file types,

841
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,170
um, you can give it kind of the review guidance,

842
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,920
talk about your general API principles,

843
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,410
make sure that it has a, uh, specific

844
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,469
checklist that it is adhering to.

845
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,789
So that any time there are changes to any

846
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:05,229
of these files that are listed

847
00:30:05,229 --> 00:30:05,789
here,

848
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:08,410
again, if you're doing something like code review,

849
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,618
this will specifically these guidelines will be

850
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:12,979
applied specifically to these file types.

851
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:15,549
The other cool thing that you can put in the Matter hatter

852
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,709
uh description here is you can

853
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,858
put, you know, if you want to exclude something,

854
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:22,150
so there might be custom instruction files

855
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,390
that you just want co-pilot

856
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,670
code review to look at or that you just

857
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,469
want the coding agent to look at.

858
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:30,900
So there's a lot of opportunity for

859
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
kind of customization and granularity that you can

860
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
get with this simple construct of using your custom

861
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,920
instruction files.

862
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:37,160
And so that's just one,

863
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:39,559
example.

864
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,078
Um, the other thing that I wanted

865
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,660
to kind of chat about is

866
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,199
using,

867
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,818
um, custom agents. And so

868
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,229
if we have,

869
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:50,390
let's see,

870
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:51,539
I think.

871
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,029
That.

872
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,160
Do do do. OK,

873
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,559
so let's take a look at this, uh, custom agent

874
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,078
that I've created, which is an accessibility agent,

875
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,358
and we're gonna see what this kind of looks like in

876
00:31:04,358 --> 00:31:06,559
action. But again, it kind of follows the same

877
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,420
top level structure. It has a description,

878
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,118
so this is an expert assistant for web

879
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:12,098
accessibility,

880
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:14,479
um, and you can configure certain

881
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,598
tools, different, uh, MCP servers

882
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:18,680
that it might want to have access

883
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,939
to and the different tools that it wants to call.

884
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:23,380
And then again you can kind of give it the

885
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,699
like. Uh, structure of what it is and

886
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,759
kind of what your expertise is and you can help ground

887
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,019
it in the context and in the

888
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,140
approach and this is again is all just

889
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,318
described as a simple markdown file so a ton

890
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:36,640
of kind of capability and benefit

891
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,660
in a very simple construct and what that

892
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,939
will look like is since I have that

893
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:42,979
accessibility agent we'll pop back over to my.

894
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:46,199
Repo for a second. Um,

895
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,469
let's go back to

896
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:51,049
the pull request. We'll come and check on co-pilot's progress

897
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,910
again in just a minute, but we'll go back

898
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,199
here. And actually, I don't even need to navigate to

899
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,068
the code tab.

900
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,519
But within the GitHub UI and I'll make

901
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,269
this a little bit bigger.

902
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,489
You have the ability, you have this agents panel

903
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,729
and a couple, uh, important things here. One,

904
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,969
you can see all of the recent sessions that I have

905
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,219
for across various agents that are happening.

906
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,088
So we see kind of our, uh, redirect

907
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,250
issue on the help center page that's the one that's

908
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,949
currently in progress,

909
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:18,368
um, but I have a couple of other ones. What's nice, I

910
00:32:18,368 --> 00:32:20,568
could pop back into any of those sessions to again

911
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:22,598
see what happened, what co-pilot's thinking was.

912
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:25,250
This is important from kind of a just auditability

913
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,439
and governance perspective. Also as an org

914
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,640
owner, you can see all of the. sessions

915
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,848
that are occurring within your organization and pop into

916
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:33,930
them. So again that's helpful from just a kind

917
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,219
of um security perspective,

918
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:38,568
but what I can do is I

919
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:40,568
can select from my list of

920
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:42,608
agents, my custom agent here. So

921
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:44,689
I'm using the accessibility agent. I still

922
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:46,689
wanna target this repository. I could go

923
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,818
to other repositories and I'm gonna give it

924
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:49,838
a um

925
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:52,828
prompt that says something like ensure

926
00:32:52,828 --> 00:32:55,430
this repo is adhering

927
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,150
to accessibility.

928
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,459
Guidelines and requirements,

929
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,000
and I'll go ahead and fire that

930
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,118
off. And what that is going to do is that's

931
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:11,439
going to use that custom agent, but custom agents fundamentally

932
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,509
work in conjunction with co-pilot coding agents.

933
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,559
So this is going to spin up another session, another

934
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,269
task that co-pilot is going to work on,

935
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:19,539
but it's within a very well,

936
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,334
uh, well-defined and scoped. Parameter

937
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,334
this is a specific task

938
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,334
and so what's nice here is any time

939
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:27,193
you have

940
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,604
tasks that you're finding yourself you're doing over and

941
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:31,844
over again, create a custom

942
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,894
agent for that. You can see some of the other

943
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:36,434
examples that I had here for um

944
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:38,674
custom agents. Let's just start a new session.

945
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:40,279
And you can see,

946
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:43,338
you know, I have a compliance bot. I have a documentation

947
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:45,588
specialist. Like there's a lot of different custom,

948
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,959
um, custom agents that you can create.

949
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,500
And speaking of, if you're like, hm, what are some other

950
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,539
good ideas for agents that you might wanna

951
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,118
create,

952
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:55,660
uh, I don't know if you all are

953
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,219
aware of this awesome repo called Awesome co-pilots,

954
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,279
but this is a great.

955
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:01,795
Resource that you could go and look at to

956
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:03,943
get ideas for um

957
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:06,305
what are some other good examples for

958
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:08,644
these customizations that you can take with co-pilot so

959
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:11,264
you can see we have, you know, examples for custom

960
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,405
prompts here for custom instructions files

961
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:15,503
for custom agents and so you

962
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:17,784
can go in here and I bet there is an accessibility

963
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:19,583
look there's an accessibility agent right there.

964
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:22,219
Um, so this is really good to kind of

965
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,340
see what are these, uh, custom agents

966
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,719
if you're looking to get some inspiration for,

967
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,458
um,

968
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,820
you know, other agents that you might wanna pull into your

969
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,898
workflow, an APR architect agent,

970
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:32,929
um,

971
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,519
you know, an Azure specialist, like there's a lot

972
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,739
in here. So definitely recommend that you go and

973
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,269
check out the awesome co-pilot

974
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,820
Repo. Um, it's, you know, open and public

975
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,860
and just a collection of good examples and

976
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,199
patterns that you can use for,

977
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,458
um, inspiration.

978
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:50,590
Um, so now I'm gonna pop back over to,

979
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,949
um, our custom instructor or our PowerPoint

980
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:53,550
for just a minute.

981
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,099
So we just talked about custom agents,

982
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,309
and so these are specialized agents again defined and marked

983
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,590
down files, but if you have specific

984
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,610
things that you find yourself

985
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,309
over and over like SEO optimization

986
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,769
is another great example

987
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,389
of where you would want to use a custom agent

988
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:10,500
because then you can really just point that agent at

989
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,590
a task at your repository and

990
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,655
say. Hey, go make sure that we're adhering

991
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,974
to these, these guidelines.

992
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,125
Again, that's the type of stuff that developers hate

993
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:19,753
working on.

994
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,215
So if you can avoid developers working on that and offload

995
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:22,934
it to an agent,

996
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,253
do so. That is the kind of toil that

997
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,454
we are eliminating. If we go back to those DevOps

998
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:29,034
principles, it was all about,

999
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,773
um, reducing the waste and that

1000
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:33,945
toil that developers hated working on.

1001
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:36,313
And so this is another example of what that looks like

1002
00:35:36,454 --> 00:35:37,635
in this AI era.

1003
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:41,489
Um, and so we saw this kind of briefly,

1004
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,889
but I would say in this, um,

1005
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:46,019
world where we are starting to see

1006
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,019
lots of agents that have multiple sessions

1007
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:50,250
that are working on different things, all of a sudden, while that's

1008
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,418
very exciting that we can leverage these tools

1009
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:53,519
to do all those things.

1010
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,869
That also creates a little bit of sprawl and

1011
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,188
if you're kind of in like the administrative or

1012
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,289
org owner role that can make you a little

1013
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,309
nervous of how do we have visibility

1014
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:05,628
into everything that's running, who kicked off what session,

1015
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,708
who, what agent is running, you

1016
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,269
know, what task and so whatever

1017
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,648
tool you're using.

1018
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:14,500
Have it be a tool that gives you visibility into

1019
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,769
all of the different agent sessions because having

1020
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,829
visibility into this, being able to

1021
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:21,168
have some kind of auditability is really important

1022
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:23,550
and just from the developer perspective

1023
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,708
to be able to manage all of your sessions is

1024
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:26,648
super helpful.

1025
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,409
One thing, um, kind of new improvement that we've brought

1026
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:31,168
to co-pilot and coding agent

1027
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:32,530
is, as we've seen,

1028
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,869
you know, a co-pilot kind of has its session, you

1029
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,918
can actually now pop into that session. And do

1030
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:39,000
live steering. Previously you had to

1031
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,719
wait for its work to complete if you

1032
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
change your mind and you know something needed to be

1033
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,349
the button needed to be pink and not blue, um,

1034
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,639
now you can actually do live steering

1035
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,639
in the session for co-pilot and you can, you

1036
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,639
know, make that quick decision and it'll take that in for

1037
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,958
feedback and adjust accordingly. So,

1038
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,360
um, the ability to kind of manage your sessions

1039
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,378
and then pop into your sessions and kind of steer

1040
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,418
is an important capability.

1041
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,188
Lastly, some of the tools that you know, you, we

1042
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,599
kind of recommend you use, um, MCP,

1043
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,530
this is,

1044
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:10,010
um, you know, it's called kind of the USBC

1045
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,148
for AI. It's kind of the universal connector

1046
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:14,628
that allows you to bring in context from external

1047
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,949
systems to provide to the LLM,

1048
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,719
honestly,

1049
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,648
now I would say

1050
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,219
this is still a little bit of uncharted

1051
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,039
territory.

1052
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:25,668
Uh, we at GitHub, we first started thinking

1053
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:26,389
about how.

1054
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,929
To integrate again, pulling in data from

1055
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:30,309
external systems to provide

1056
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:33,050
to co-pilot to make it more effective, to bring

1057
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,329
your context from your organization into

1058
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:37,489
the chat to make the responses that you're getting

1059
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,789
more tailored to your organization.

1060
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:41,369
And we first went on this journey and started with something that we

1061
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:42,300
called extensions,

1062
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,010
and that was about 4 months

1063
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,128
before that Anthropic announced MCP

1064
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:49,929
and everyone quickly was like, OK, MCP

1065
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:50,929
is the way.

1066
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,478
And so you know we also kind of adopted

1067
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:54,849
that and have, you know,

1068
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:57,250
support for MCP servers and have an MCP server

1069
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,750
registry and all of that goodness

1070
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:00,510
within the co-pilot ecosystem

1071
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:03,079
and then I don't know if anyone caught, um, about

1072
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,409
3 weeks ago anthropically something called

1073
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:06,070
skills

1074
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:08,530
and so that might be a new construct. So I

1075
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,530
would say, you know, MCP is still a little

1076
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,510
bit of, um, not unproven

1077
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,570
technology, but they're still. A lot of question marks with it. I think there's

1078
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,769
still a lot of unanswered questions for how we're going

1079
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:18,590
to do this

1080
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:20,929
in kind of a standardized way.

1081
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,369
So we'll see kind of where all this shakes

1082
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,409
out. For now it's MCP. It

1083
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,050
might look a little different in six months,

1084
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,489
but for now, you know, this is a really good kind

1085
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:31,590
of path, and there is a lot of adoption

1086
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,929
around using MCP as the way to

1087
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,389
pull additional data into

1088
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,610
your systems.

1089
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,938
Um, but it is important to have some governance,

1090
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,219
um, in place because, you know, you,

1091
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,010
these are,

1092
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,699
you're giving tools access to

1093
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,849
your secure development environments. There's a lot of

1094
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,300
information that they can access and so,

1095
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:51,579
um, you wanna make sure that you're doing that in a thoughtful

1096
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,699
and mindful way. You wanna make sure

1097
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:54,239
that they're,

1098
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,739
um, able to meet compliance standards and

1099
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,231
that you're kind of balanced. Balancing,

1100
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,981
you know, the productivity that you wanna get with also being,

1101
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:03,202
um, sensitive to the information that's also being shared

1102
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:05,242
with these tools and so some of the kind of

1103
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,682
best practices that you can, um,

1104
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:09,722
deploy is you can use a registry based allow

1105
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,242
list. You should always use OO if you can,

1106
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,603
um, you wanna be able to define and control

1107
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,682
which MCP servers developers are using.

1108
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:17,842
You don't just want it to be like.

1109
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:19,094
Wild Wild West,

1110
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,505
whatever tool developer kind of

1111
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,505
sees fit for that purpose, you wanna

1112
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:25,144
have a little bit more control over that,

1113
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:28,016
um, you wanna block kind of any unapproved

1114
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:30,025
usage that you haven't specifically said

1115
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:32,385
like yes it's OK to use this particular tool,

1116
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,746
um, and then of course always like communicate that

1117
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,166
well to developers provide clear,

1118
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:37,885
um, policy messaging.

1119
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,659
Um, and one other just kind of piece

1120
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:44,309
as from the like the control aspects

1121
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:45,090
within kind of this AI,

1122
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:47,958
uh, world is the ability to audit

1123
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,320
this, um, activity and so specifically

1124
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,878
with Co-Pilot we've recently made some

1125
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,280
improvements to our audit log for all

1126
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,360
of these things that are kicking off and the ways that you're using

1127
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,938
Co-Pilott

1128
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,360
so now you're able to understand who is.

1129
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:01,675
The kind of user that initiated a request,

1130
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,003
what is the co-pilot like interaction

1131
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:06,023
if it's coding agent versus code review

1132
00:40:06,164 --> 00:40:08,445
that is hat that, you know, performs the action and

1133
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:10,684
all of this is auditable via the audit log. So

1134
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:11,824
I'm giving you a little bit more

1135
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,684
control because you can't go fast

1136
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:16,724
without the proper guardrails in place. And so

1137
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:17,744
this is just one example

1138
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,364
of one of those guardrails.

1139
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:22,800
OK, so if we think about

1140
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:24,478
what is the kind of new,

1141
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,500
the whole DevOps pipeline look like in this

1142
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,699
AI world

1143
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,559
today. In yesteryear,

1144
00:40:32,688 --> 00:40:34,918
this is kind of what your old life cycle

1145
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,918
would look like. You would have an

1146
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:39,000
idea that is born. You'd have a number of developers that

1147
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,829
are working on it,

1148
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,619
and, the idea would be logged, a ticket would be created

1149
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,079
to track that work, uh, you would assign

1150
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,079
that ticket to, you know, a

1151
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,438
developer, a team member.

1152
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,840
There would need to be clarification that would

1153
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,000
happen. Sometimes context could get

1154
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,679
could get lost. The developer goes on vacation.

1155
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:57,045
You're having to kick it over to another developer,

1156
00:40:57,364 --> 00:40:59,726
you know, a PR is initially

1157
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:01,936
opened, reviewed, more feedback is

1158
00:41:01,936 --> 00:41:04,005
given another more work continues

1159
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,505
you iterate, you iterate.

1160
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:07,804
Finally, maybe you, you know, um, do

1161
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:09,815
some security checks, um, kind

1162
00:41:09,815 --> 00:41:10,625
of get those,

1163
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,125
uh, taken care of, and then, you

1164
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,585
know, you can approve it and merge it sometimes,

1165
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,835
hopefully not, but sometimes then vulnerabilities

1166
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:18,686
can even be found.

1167
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:19,990
In production after,

1168
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:22,592
uh, things have been merged and then you're gonna kind of kick kick

1169
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:24,641
that back and address it from the beginning,

1170
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:26,771
but this is what the kind of the old life cycle

1171
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:28,931
looked like and this could range anywhere

1172
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,010
from weeks to

1173
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,152
months and so if you were, you know, really,

1174
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:35,371
um, a fast moving organization

1175
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,440
that had really good deployment pipelines in place, this

1176
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,672
could maybe be on the order, uh, magnitude of weeks,

1177
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:42,052
um, but more likely probably in the month

1178
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:42,672
time frame.

1179
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,699
Well today it looks a little different and in

1180
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:47,780
terms of who's involved it's gonna look a

1181
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,688
little bit different.

1182
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:50,699
So the new life cycle is that yes,

1183
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:53,019
ideas will still be born and that is where

1184
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:55,398
human creativity will never cease

1185
00:41:55,398 --> 00:41:56,239
to be necessary

1186
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,099
and then you're going to, you know, have some brainstorming

1187
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,378
that needs to happen. There's gonna need to be a human

1188
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:03,378
that approves. Yes, this is the plan,

1189
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,648
this is the next right thing that. We need to

1190
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,208
work on.

1191
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,570
You're gonna do some specking. What should this

1192
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,688
thing look like? You're gonna need human approval

1193
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:11,869
for that as well.

1194
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:14,128
You can see that we have a couple of humans, but then we

1195
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:16,208
have a whole lot of robots. That is

1196
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,320
to signify that could be get co-pilot.

1197
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,369
That could be cursor. That could be cloud code. That could

1198
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:22,769
be your tool du jour

1199
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:24,688
of your tool of choice du jour

1200
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,909
tool du jour anyway, your tool of choice.

1201
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:29,510
And so you know I mentioned earlier

1202
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,789
the developers are not going away. Developers are absolutely

1203
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,869
still in the loop, but I will acknowledge that the

1204
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:36,458
role of the developer, really everyone's responsibilities,

1205
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,869
is really starting to evolve and change

1206
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:39,429
a bit.

1207
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:42,110
And so I was, you know, talking with some colleagues

1208
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,269
and we were talking about, you know, this idea

1209
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:45,128
of specking

1210
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,449
and how important that has become

1211
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:49,804
in today. Day and age when you're handing

1212
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:52,204
over an issue to something like co-pilot

1213
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:53,034
coding agent,

1214
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:54,784
your mileage will vary

1215
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,253
substantially based on how

1216
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:59,563
well documented that issue is, how

1217
00:42:59,563 --> 00:43:01,304
specific you are in terms of what

1218
00:43:01,594 --> 00:43:03,224
expected output you expect to see,

1219
00:43:03,603 --> 00:43:05,644
um, you know, the test coverage that needs to be required, you know,

1220
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:08,164
any amount of detail that you can put in that

1221
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:10,688
issue. Is the more detail

1222
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,739
the better and so specing is gonna becoming

1223
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,769
more and more important so developers

1224
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:15,349
are gonna start

1225
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:17,070
becoming better at writing

1226
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:18,000
specs.

1227
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,349
PMs are going to become

1228
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:22,409
a little bit more technical and more proficient

1229
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:24,530
and maybe a little less reliant on

1230
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,228
developers.

1231
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,590
Now a PM could have maybe

1232
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,889
3 different ideas for what a front

1233
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:31,893
end could look like. And they have

1234
00:43:31,893 --> 00:43:34,012
these designs captured in Figma. Well, they could

1235
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,112
work and use the Figma MCP

1236
00:43:36,112 --> 00:43:38,211
server and and GitHub copilot, and

1237
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,413
they could create 3 different front-end

1238
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,492
prototypes. They don't have to go to the developer and say,

1239
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,932
Hey, can you wire up 3 different

1240
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:46,932
of these apps so that we can decide which

1241
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:48,961
one looks best? Now they're gonna be able to do that

1242
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:49,512
on their own.

1243
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:51,972
And so everyone's role is going to evolve a

1244
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:53,652
little bit, and I mentioned that.

1245
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:55,715
I don't think we're that far off from

1246
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:58,135
developers, um, seeing that 90%

1247
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,275
of the code being written is likely being written

1248
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:02,456
by agents and so they're

1249
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,635
gonna be more responsible for understanding

1250
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:07,215
what is this software need to look like, what does this architecture

1251
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:09,364
need to look like, what are the specs and the success,

1252
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:11,755
the acceptance criteria that is, that's gonna be

1253
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:13,186
part of this project,

1254
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:15,956
and I was listening to a talk.

1255
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:19,199
Um, by Brendan Burns, who's one of the co-founders,

1256
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,309
um, or one of the original,

1257
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,918
um, contributors to the Kubernetes project,

1258
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,208
and he was talking about layers of abstraction,

1259
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,250
and he said, you know, if you write code in C,

1260
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,809
you're two layers of abstraction from away

1261
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:31,579
from the computer that's actually running that code

1262
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,929
because C compiles down to the intermediate language

1263
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:36,280
and then that compiles down to assembly. And

1264
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,579
so from the developer perspective, like, you're not actually

1265
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,599
seeing like the code that's getting executed, that's

1266
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:41,280
getting run

1267
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,728
because we have abstraction layers in between us, right?

1268
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,500
And so similarly we're now just creating another

1269
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
level of abstraction that developers are

1270
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,739
going to kind of benefit from

1271
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,860
because they're gonna be more responsible for architecting

1272
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,099
the entire system,

1273
00:44:54,378 --> 00:44:56,409
how the agents are gonna coordinate with each other,

1274
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,659
but the actual execution, the atomic

1275
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:00,958
unit of execution is gonna happen

1276
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:03,059
with the agent. Like that's just the reality of the

1277
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:03,929
world that we're living in.

1278
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:06,590
And so we will see that, you know, more

1279
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,978
and more we're gonna rely on the robots to,

1280
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,478
um, take care of this process for us.

1281
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,148
But that's OK because again, humans aren't

1282
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:16,228
going anywhere, it's just the nature of the responsibilities

1283
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:18,110
is changing slightly.

1284
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,829
And so what we see here though is, you know, after

1285
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:22,898
we've kind of brainstormed inspect, like what is it that we

1286
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,030
need to build, we're gonna do some coding, we're gonna do lots of coding,

1287
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:25,909
we're gonna iterate.

1288
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:28,610
You know, oh, we might have found a bug, and

1289
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,010
as part of that process of that code being generated.

1290
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,688
You want to have as much automation

1291
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,918
as possible in place so that it

1292
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:38,208
doesn't slow down again, kind of

1293
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,438
become the bottleneck in the overall process.

1294
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,110
Remember, we're trying to optimize the ease

1295
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:45,398
of and uh software being able to flow

1296
00:45:45,398 --> 00:45:47,465
through the system with ease. And so what we're

1297
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:49,925
looking at is things in there you can see that

1298
00:45:49,925 --> 00:45:52,125
it says auto fix, and that's a co-pilot capability

1299
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,385
that is able to identify if there's a security

1300
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:56,094
vulnerability that's been detected,

1301
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,545
understands what that security vulnerability is, and then can

1302
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:01,025
actually suggest a fix to remediate

1303
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:01,985
that process.

1304
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,594
So I'll show you what this looks like within the PR workflow

1305
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:06,945
and how you can use that. But again, if we can rely

1306
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:09,152
on. Agents to help remove these blockers

1307
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:11,402
and not get hung up when we do run into

1308
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:12,740
anything that's gonna be key

1309
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:15,201
because while we do have to ensure that the software that is

1310
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:17,201
getting delivered is secure if

1311
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:19,561
we can automate how that is detected

1312
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:21,981
and then remediated all the better, right?

1313
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,382
Put the guard rails in place but let them be,

1314
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:26,681
um, you know, handled by these agents to help

1315
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:27,382
you move fast.

1316
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,708
Um, then, you know, kind of continuing down the

1317
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,750
process we're gonna be able to do code review that also can be

1318
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,110
handled in agentic fashion these days all

1319
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,168
the way to kind of we're ready to

1320
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:39,469
deploy again that's gonna need human

1321
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:41,668
approval, of course, just to make sure that everything that's

1322
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:44,010
generated looks good, designs as,

1323
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,688
um, intended, that is behaving

1324
00:46:46,688 --> 00:46:48,750
as designed and that everything

1325
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,978
is secure and adhering to all standards

1326
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,648
and compliance requirements.

1327
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,199
So I mentioned as part of that,

1328
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:58,469
um, a couple of things. First thing, co-pilot code review.

1329
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,159
This allows you to do kind of an engentic

1330
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,300
code review, and this is something that you can set up

1331
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:06,119
as a rule set on your repository

1332
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,239
so that every PR that gets created

1333
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,840
leverages co-pilot code review.

1334
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,099
You can even configure it so that it can run,

1335
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:15,269
um, security tools or linters,

1336
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,860
and you can have a number of things. In fact, you can even,

1337
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,360
oh no, um, we'll see configuring a

1338
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,844
linter, um, but so that you. Can have

1339
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,764
a code review do a first pass because oftentimes

1340
00:47:25,764 --> 00:47:28,324
we see that that's where one of the longest wait times

1341
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:30,523
occurs is waiting for a human code

1342
00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:32,603
review to occur and so if you can at least

1343
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:34,603
take a first pass from an agent that's

1344
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,875
an incredible benefit to developers to

1345
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:39,164
again not slow down the process to keep things

1346
00:47:39,164 --> 00:47:41,405
moving. You can catch things earlier developers

1347
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:42,625
can fix it that's less

1348
00:47:43,114 --> 00:47:45,324
manual or that's less um

1349
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:47,684
requirement on the human developer that will ultimately

1350
00:47:47,684 --> 00:47:48,385
come in

1351
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:49,905
um and you can help.

1352
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,628
To reduce the overall load of what they're reviewing

1353
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:54,309
when they do step into the process.

1354
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,668
So you can do a co-pilot code review. Again, you can

1355
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:57,929
do that in an automated way.

1356
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:01,148
You can also do co-pilot autofix. This is what

1357
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:03,389
I described, um, where you're

1358
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:05,539
if a security vulnerability is detected,

1359
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,989
now you're able to kind of have the developer

1360
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:08,688
spend less time

1361
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,030
fixing those vulnerabilities if you can offload it to

1362
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,699
an agent.

1363
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,269
So this is something that, um, co-pilot

1364
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,309
code agent or co-pilot coding agent can now

1365
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:18,728
do. It has, uh, security capabilities

1366
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:21,188
so that it can do auto fixes and can leverage

1367
00:48:21,188 --> 00:48:23,590
our static analysis tool codeQL

1368
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,349
under the hood,

1369
00:48:24,728 --> 00:48:26,869
um, and you're able to again kind of have an agent

1370
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:28,168
to help you with this process.

1371
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,250
So, um, and when you're leveraging,

1372
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,829
um, autofix when you're doing this kind of at scale,

1373
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:36,219
you're really able to see, you know, faster

1374
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:38,260
fixes that occur within the pull request.

1375
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,418
So catching these things, of course, before they make

1376
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,840
it to production, you wanna catch it

1377
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:44,219
in the developer workflow in the GitHub world

1378
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:45,519
we really consider that the PR,

1379
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:48,179
um, these are the, this is the time and place to

1380
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,179
catch these vulnerabilities and to remediate them

1381
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:51,438
before it moves any further.

1382
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:54,349
Um, you're able to see kind of 7X

1383
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,938
faster fixes for things like cross-site scripting, 12x

1384
00:48:56,938 --> 00:48:58,969
faster fixes for things like SQL injection.

1385
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,050
Um, these are very common patterns that LM

1386
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,148
LLMs have gotten very good at detecting and knowing what

1387
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:06,228
is the canonical fix in order to remediate that

1388
00:49:06,228 --> 00:49:06,949
vulnerability.

1389
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,668
So again, that's low hanging fruit that we can just offload

1390
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:11,750
to a deve to an agent so that your

1391
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,750
developers don't really have to worry about it. Of

1392
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,909
course they'll be able to review the fix and to make

1393
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:16,500
sure that,

1394
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,869
um, you know, it looks good. Of course you're still gonna

1395
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:21,000
have all of your testing framework. Work there to make

1396
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,019
sure that everything is still green and passing

1397
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,639
um and so nothing you know everything is still being

1398
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:28,179
reviewed and following best secure practices

1399
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,869
um you're leveraging an agent and not having to

1400
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:32,918
take developer time to actually implement these fixes

1401
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:34,219
so pretty meaningful

1402
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,619
so let's take a quick

1403
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:38,699
uh look at what that um

1404
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:41,039
looks like so.

1405
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,010
If I go back to

1406
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,418
my repository, you can actually see here,

1407
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:48,438
um,

1408
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
I'm gonna go back to another pull request that

1409
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,840
I have, not the one that co-pilot just opened,

1410
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:53,938
the one that I had.

1411
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,739
Um, opened earlier today and

1412
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,739
we can look at what this looks like again. We

1413
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:01,099
kind of see the PR as the

1414
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,340
place that a lot of these

1415
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,510
processes should occur because this is where developers are

1416
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,079
already kind of

1417
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,340
used to getting feedback.

1418
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:10,539
They're still kind of actively working, but this is

1419
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,099
where, um, you know, code scanning it's

1420
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:15,898
run and any vulnerabilities that are detected

1421
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:18,019
are, um, alerted and notified and

1422
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,219
annotated within the PR.

1423
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,969
So we can see that we have a number of different actions

1424
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:24,409
that are being run. We're doing a dependency

1425
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,179
review to make sure none of our, um,

1426
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,789
packages have vulnerabilities

1427
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:30,889
in them. Um, we're also doing a

1428
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:33,389
CI results, um, summary.

1429
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:36,219
And then you can see here that we have this

1430
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:38,300
bot, GitHub Advanced Security bot,

1431
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,679
and it's calling out, you know, a specific,

1432
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,539
uh, file, and we'll see here

1433
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,869
that we actually have an alert

1434
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:47,978
from CodeQL again, that's the technology

1435
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,539
we're using under the hood to do static analysis scanning.

1436
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,000
And that we have a vulnerability for

1437
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,228
uh missing rate limiting

1438
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,688
and that co-pilot has a

1439
00:50:56,688 --> 00:50:58,769
suggested auto fix so it gives you a high

1440
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:00,769
level description of, you

1441
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,929
know, what the problem is and what the fix

1442
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,668
needs to be and then

1443
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,168
giving you a summary of the changes that that are

1444
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:09,260
required and then it actually gives

1445
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,329
you that suggested

1446
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:13,369
fix right in kind of this diff

1447
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:13,889
view,

1448
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,168
um, similarly, you'd be making changes to two files.

1449
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:18,760
And so you can, you know, commit right from

1450
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,878
here. You can also, you know, open this in

1451
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,878
your IDE. It'll take you right to kind

1452
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:25,070
of this fix and the proposed, the, um,

1453
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:27,079
proposed fix from co-pilot. You know, there's

1454
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,079
a number of different things that you, a number of actions

1455
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:29,699
that you can take.

1456
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,228
Similarly, so we have a lot of, uh, issues

1457
00:51:32,228 --> 00:51:34,188
in this PR. No surprise, I wrote it,

1458
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,789
um, and so we can see that we have a number of vulnerabilities,

1459
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:38,878
but we have autofi there to help us

1460
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,099
out with those vulnerabilities. And so that's on,

1461
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:41,679
um.

1462
00:51:42,148 --> 00:51:44,148
Ultimately what that looks like. So that's super

1463
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:45,898
helpful that I'm alerted of that.

1464
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:48,489
If I wasn't within the PR, if the code scanning

1465
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:50,510
ran kind of out of bounds and it wasn't new

1466
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,590
code that was being checked in

1467
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,869
that had code scanning running on it, um,

1468
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:57,110
oops, um, and I pop over to my security

1469
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,539
tab, and I had just security results,

1470
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,590
um, just in general. So here we can look at, we

1471
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,628
have a code injection,

1472
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:03,898
critical vulnerability.

1473
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,289
This is interesting because this is actually looking at our

1474
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,686
actual. Workflows and we have potential

1475
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:10,686
code injection in

1476
00:52:10,686 --> 00:52:13,105
uh the parameters that we're passing into our workflow

1477
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:15,206
because it could be controlled by an external

1478
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:15,784
user

1479
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:18,246
and so what this is now saying is

1480
00:52:18,246 --> 00:52:20,246
that you know using user controlled input and

1481
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:22,266
actions could lead to code injection.

1482
00:52:22,284 --> 00:52:24,625
It gives us more information here which is super handy

1483
00:52:24,844 --> 00:52:26,844
but what I'm able to do is I'm also able

1484
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:29,175
to generate a fix for this vulnerability.

1485
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:31,922
So again, kind of in terms of. Reducing

1486
00:52:31,922 --> 00:52:34,021
cognitive load from the developer, the ability to

1487
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:35,641
do this is super impactful.

1488
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,010
But more importantly, what I was, um,

1489
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,422
more trying to show was that you have the ability to kind

1490
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:42,422
of catch these things in the PR in an

1491
00:52:42,422 --> 00:52:43,922
automated fashion.

1492
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:46,382
Now you also have the ability to assign

1493
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:48,422
if there are vulnerabilities are detected, you

1494
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:50,581
can assign those directly to co-pilot coding agent

1495
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:52,780
to take care of. So there's, that's another

1496
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,882
way that you can kind of offload to

1497
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:55,780
the agents.

1498
00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:58,478
The other thing that I wanted to show you, I mentioned

1499
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:00,478
we talked about code review, and

1500
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,639
so I just wanted to pop into my repo

1501
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:03,780
settings, go down to

1502
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,438
um co-pilot and to do code review and

1503
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:08,099
to show you kind of what that looks like.

1504
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,110
So we have a

1505
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:12,889
rule set that has been set up that leverages

1506
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,889
code reviews. So I'm gonna pop into this rule

1507
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:17,050
set, and this is really how you protect

1508
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,168
whether you want it. You can create a rule, uh, rule

1509
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:21,369
set for a branch, a tag, a

1510
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,708
release. There's a number of different ways and,

1511
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:25,929
um, interactions that you can apply a rule set

1512
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:28,668
to, um, and you can, you know, um,

1513
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,050
specify which repositories you're trying to target, which

1514
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,050
branches you're trying to target, and then you

1515
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,090
can see some of the rules that we have

1516
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,099
in place for to. Protect this

1517
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:39,119
branch, um, we require that pull

1518
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,159
requests occur before merging. Um,

1519
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:43,500
we require workflows to pass before merging. We

1520
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,148
require code scanning results.

1521
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,539
Uh, we require code quality results.

1522
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,679
Now we have the ability to do, uh, code

1523
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,110
quality with, um,

1524
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:53,800
uh, an agent, a co-pilot agent,

1525
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,159
but you can also request the co-pilot

1526
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:58,340
do a code review. And so it could be on

1527
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,418
like this will just be on every PR

1528
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:02,559
that is created. You could also then

1529
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,119
optionally, um.

1530
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:07,239
Select or elect to have it on

1531
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:09,438
any new pushes or also on draft pull

1532
00:54:09,438 --> 00:54:11,099
requests, so a little bit of choice there,

1533
00:54:11,438 --> 00:54:13,760
um, and then you can also manage which static

1534
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,000
analysis tools co-pilot will use in

1535
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,398
its code review. And so code QL is selected

1536
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,438
by, um, default, but then you can

1537
00:54:20,438 --> 00:54:22,599
also select to include linters here.

1538
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:24,958
So there's a lot that we're starting to offload as part

1539
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,054
of the code review process. To

1540
00:54:27,054 --> 00:54:29,603
again catch these issues

1541
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,644
before um as early as possible to give that

1542
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,804
feedback to the developer as soon as possible

1543
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,155
so again we're not trying to slow things down

1544
00:54:36,155 --> 00:54:38,284
later on in the process we're trying to catch

1545
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:39,914
them much um

1546
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:41,965
further um along.

1547
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:44,869
And so yeah, I think that's

1548
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,139
all that I wanted to

1549
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,550
show you with code review just that this is

1550
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,639
definitely something of best practice that we

1551
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:52,719
recommend that you can, you know, have

1552
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,079
this occur on every PR that

1553
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:57,148
is created on GitHub and

1554
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:59,260
so this is, you know, something that I would definitely recommend

1555
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,679
that you all look into.

1556
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:04,000
Alright, so we're wrapping up here. We have about 5 minutes

1557
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,139
left. Um,

1558
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:07,800
you know, I was talking earlier that we're, we're thinking

1559
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,090
about the front end of the funnel, and that's where we have no problem

1560
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,280
today. We have so many tools that are available to us

1561
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,110
or helping developers generate code,

1562
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:15,398
um, and

1563
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:17,309
before this time, you know,

1564
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:19,099
speeds that we've never seen before,

1565
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,360
um, but now we need to focus on the other

1566
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,530
half of the pipeline which, uh, is all about

1567
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,719
verification and validation, making sure that this

1568
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:27,760
code is secure and that we're comfortable bringing

1569
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,840
it into our production environment. And so

1570
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,001
just from kind of a. TLDR for some of the things

1571
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:34,452
that we talked about, you obviously wanna have your validation

1572
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:36,492
or your security validation tools. Security

1573
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:38,532
has become more is more important

1574
00:55:38,532 --> 00:55:40,643
than ever in this era of generative

1575
00:55:40,643 --> 00:55:41,172
AI.

1576
00:55:41,492 --> 00:55:43,612
You also should leverage co-pilot code review because

1577
00:55:43,612 --> 00:55:45,731
there's so much that you can tailor

1578
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:48,012
within that process. You can pass it custom instructions

1579
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,172
files. You can require that it runs

1580
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:52,811
on every PR. You can have it run

1581
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:55,193
security tools like static analysis or

1582
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:57,652
linters, and you can have those things occur

1583
00:55:57,652 --> 00:55:59,731
automatically at the PR level as part of the

1584
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,065
code. View before a human ever even gets

1585
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:04,206
involved and then you can also use our new

1586
00:56:04,206 --> 00:56:06,344
uh quality code quality agent

1587
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:08,416
which will give you a score for things like

1588
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,425
readability, maintainability, any quality

1589
00:56:10,425 --> 00:56:12,585
issues that are surfaced. It'll surface

1590
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:14,625
those for you. You can have a developer

1591
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:16,784
look at those. You can apply. You can ask co-pilot coding

1592
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:19,144
agent to generate, um, a fix

1593
00:56:19,144 --> 00:56:21,605
for those quality issues that are surfaced. So

1594
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:24,266
there's a lot that can, you know, help you

1595
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:26,425
tools that are already available that you can realize

1596
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,505
today to help you stay secure in this, in this

1597
00:56:28,505 --> 00:56:30,510
space. All right,

1598
00:56:30,628 --> 00:56:32,949
so in sum, here's some of my recommendations

1599
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:35,070
and calls to action for you

1600
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,329
all to do today,

1601
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:37,579
um,

1602
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:40,030
invest in the primitives. I've talked a lot

1603
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,250
about this, but

1604
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,789
use those custom instruction files

1605
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:45,789
because they are so

1606
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:47,789
you can be so specific and so granular and so

1607
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:49,860
tailored into what you're trying to

1608
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,070
do at different processes, whether that's code generation

1609
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:54,429
or code review leverage those custom instruction

1610
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:55,010
files.

1611
00:56:55,429 --> 00:56:57,708
Every repository should have

1612
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,878
one. I'm really gonna lean into

1613
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,929
that. Every repository should have one.

1614
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,000
second, whether it's MC it's MCP

1615
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
today, if this changes in the future, we'll

1616
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,030
see, but leverage the tools that allow you

1617
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,280
to pull context in from other systems

1618
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,378
to be more effective in using your LLMs.

1619
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,199
Secondly, leverage the agents. The agents

1620
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,199
are what help you automate

1621
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:20,280
away the toil. It's again, coming back

1622
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,559
to those DevOps principles. Remove toil, remove

1623
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,679
those bottlenecks. The agents are the

1624
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:26,519
tools that can help you do that.

1625
00:57:27,809 --> 00:57:29,889
Then leverage the

1626
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:32,039
processes. So do the code review,

1627
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:34,449
have automated verification and validation.

1628
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:36,530
That's the part of the funnel that we're really trying

1629
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,809
to focus on right now. So have those

1630
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:40,849
processes that can help you validate and verify that

1631
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:42,188
the code is good to go.

1632
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,199
And then lastly, don't forget about the fundamentals

1633
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,219
again. AI does not change any

1634
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:48,978
of the core of DevOps. So

1635
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:51,438
having code scans, using linters, doing

1636
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:53,619
code reviews, having code owners, all

1637
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:55,260
of that, small PRs, frequent,

1638
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,478
um, check-ins,

1639
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,860
none of that goes away. Those things like

1640
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,139
we're doubling down on the importance of those things

1641
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:03,418
in this AI era. So definitely don't

1642
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:05,760
lose track of the fundamentals. And if you're not doing

1643
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,840
these things well today, AI is

1644
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,000
gonna bite you. So focus on doing

1645
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,780
those things really well first.

1646
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:15,849
And so again, just a kind of friendly

1647
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:17,929
reminder because it's one of the my favorite

1648
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:18,949
things to talk about,

1649
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:20,469
we are leveraging

1650
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:23,128
co-pilot coding agent internally and it's really

1651
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,289
driving huge impacts in terms of our backlog and

1652
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:26,289
addressing our tech debt.

1653
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:27,668
But

1654
00:58:28,148 --> 00:58:30,500
really don't take it from me because I'm in sales,

1655
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,679
so, uh, but you should take it from Brittany,

1656
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
and this was a talk I know it's maybe not

1657
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,958
standard to, you know, pitch someone else's talk

1658
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,958
when you're giving a talk, but Britney stood up

1659
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:41,300
at GitHub Universe, which is about 5 weeks ago,

1660
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,639
and she said, I'm not in marketing and

1661
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,760
I'm not in sales. I'm an engineer at

1662
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,800
GitHub. I don't even work on co-pilot. I work in

1663
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,478
billing,

1664
00:58:48,878 --> 00:58:50,954
and she said, I'm just here to talk. To you about

1665
00:58:50,954 --> 00:58:53,503
how excited I am, how we're using co-pilot

1666
00:58:53,503 --> 00:58:55,625
coding agent to tackle tech debt on

1667
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,985
our team, and she gives really good examples

1668
00:58:57,985 --> 00:59:00,023
of the tech debt that they're addressing, the ways to

1669
00:59:00,023 --> 00:59:02,014
be most effective with co-pilot coding agent,

1670
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:04,485
and it's just an overall delightful talk. So

1671
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,864
there's a QR code there. I highly recommend that you go

1672
00:59:06,864 --> 00:59:09,023
check out Brittany's talk because she's kind of the

1673
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:11,023
real world, um, experience that

1674
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:13,445
can speak to using these things in a production system.

1675
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Um, and that's all that I

1676
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,039
have for you. So thank you very much for your

1677
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,320
time. Appreciate y'all all being here. Hope you have a fabulous

1678
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,539
rest of your conference. Tomorrow's Friday.

1679
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:23,809
Yay.

1680
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,139
Uh, thanks guys.
