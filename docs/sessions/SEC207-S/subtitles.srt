1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:01,750
Hey, good afternoon,

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,349
everybody. Uh, you are surviving AWS

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:06,629
reinvent and we're glad you're here. This is the last

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,788
day. Let's power through. I'm Sean O'Dell. I

5
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:10,210
lead our developer experience team

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,210
at Dynatrace, and I have

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,509
Simone who, uh, actually, go ahead and

8
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,670
introduce yourself, Simone. Hi, everyone, Simone

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,789
here. I'm a principal solution architect at

10
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:19,510
AWS.

11
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,579
Perfect. Uh, and go ahead and go to the

12
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,739
agenda slide if you don't mind. One thing I want to mention real

13
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,739
quick, this is a very loose agenda, but what we

14
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,859
do want to cover is a few of the announcements

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,059
that have been made this week, specifically from AWS

16
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,060
and Dina Trace,

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,408
3 straight days of main stage

18
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,649
keynote introductions and

19
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,700
conversations. We'll talk a little bit about how we work

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,978
together and some of the things around, uh, agents

21
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:41,740
and obviously bed.

22
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:42,740
Agent Core.

23
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,118
And then I want to introduce a little bit of how we at

24
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,478
Dina Trace add and add value

25
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:48,439
and supplement

26
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,759
uh what the uh Amazon

27
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,118
team and specifically Simone,

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,598
myself, and a few others have been working on. And

29
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:56,740
so we'll go from there and then we'll have Q&A after

30
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,200
the, uh, after the session,

31
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:00,319
preferably in the Dina Trace booth

32
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,639
just to help out here in the room. But glad to have you

33
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:06,028
here today. Perfect.

34
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,549
So thank you very much, Sean, for introducing

35
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,870
this. And yes, here we can see

36
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,379
a slide with the partnership between

37
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,769
Dyna Trace and AWS.

38
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,129
It's a very strong partnership. Dina Trace is one

39
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,168
of the very valuable partners of

40
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:21,829
AWS.

41
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:22,948
And

42
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,888
let's dive into the topic for today.

43
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,980
So, Amazon Bedrock Agent Core, how many

44
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,239
of you are familiar with the uh this service?

45
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,319
Nice, quiet. Some of you. And how many of you are

46
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,418
using the service today?

47
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,049
All right, some of you.

48
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:37,939
Perfect.

49
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,459
So, Bedrock Agent Core is a service

50
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,620
that helps you to run your Agentic workload

51
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,698
in production, and today with Sean, we will

52
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:46,980
talk about how you can use uh Dyna trace

53
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,599
to observe your agents.

54
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,209
All right, let's start from the challenges

55
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,859
when building a genetic applications.

56
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:54,730
Actually,

57
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,010
what we hear from customers is that

58
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,250
building agents for proof of concept is

59
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,930
very easy, how to say,

60
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,370
because, you know, putting together an agent

61
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,969
is not a big deal.

62
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,129
However, what is difficult is.

63
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,788
those agents to production.

64
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:11,528
Think about the scenario that you see on the slide here.

65
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:14,149
So you may have an agent in your department

66
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,409
that needs to access many

67
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,379
tools and potentially other agents,

68
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,429
maybe within your department or maybe

69
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,419
within your organization,

70
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,229
and potentially even outside of your

71
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,788
organization, right?

72
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,149
And all of this can prove very complex to

73
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:28,278
do at scale

74
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,618
if you need to manage all the layers, including the

75
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,788
infrastructure and the application layer.

76
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,899
And actually this is one of the reasons why

77
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Gartner believes that by 2027,

78
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,038
more than 40% of the Agentic AI

79
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,258
projects will be canceled.

80
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,508
And the reason why is because moving

81
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:48,189
from POC,

82
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,649
where there is a lot of excitement and potential.

83
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,879
To production where you get to the business value

84
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,020
is quite challenging. So there are a lot of challenges

85
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,550
in that. Let's take a look at the main challenges,

86
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,899
and then how Bedrock Agent Core addresses

87
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,300
those challenges and how Dynatrace further

88
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,879
improves that with their observability capabilities.

89
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,699
All right, so, um, talking about

90
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,740
the, uh, the challenges. So the

91
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,679
first challenge is that uh when you actually

92
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,179
build your agents, uh, uh, you need a

93
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:20,750
dedicated, uh, uh, how to say, infrastructure

94
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,020
and runtime to run them on, and agents

95
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,419
are very different from traditional

96
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,580
applications. Because agents require, how

97
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,868
to say, dedicated infrastructure that

98
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,240
can run maybe for minutes,

99
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,330
maybe for hours.

100
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,909
You don't really know how long an agent will run.

101
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,409
You don't even know how many

102
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,028
parallel executions the agent will will

103
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:41,069
do. So this can be very challenging

104
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,610
to do with traditional infrastructure.

105
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,819
Also, uh, LLMs are

106
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,080
stateless, the LLMs behind the agent. So

107
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:51,058
when you build an agent, you need the memory capabilities,

108
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,219
right, for the agent to know about the session,

109
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,659
to know about the past interactions, and

110
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,710
yes, in order to do that, um,

111
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,099
you also need capabilities, and

112
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,219
this also takes time.

113
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,199
The third one is that agents

114
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,360
need to access third party tools or potential

115
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,399
internal tools such as think

116
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,409
about databases, think about Google

117
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,819
Drive, think about

118
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,629
maybe your storage system,

119
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,439
and in order to access those tools, the agents

120
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,329
need identities,

121
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,678
and this can also be challenging to manage

122
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:21,600
in such a setup.

123
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,670
The 4th point is that agents

124
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,829
need to discover tools and

125
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,100
interact with those tools.

126
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,988
So actually connecting to discovering

127
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,069
and managing all those tools at scale can also

128
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,088
prove very challenging.

129
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,920
And then the 5th point is that

130
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,678
these agents may need to go beyond interaction

131
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,720
with basic tools that I mentioned before, and

132
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,778
they may do more advanced things, for example,

133
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,278
using a browser or I don't

134
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,358
know, generating code and

135
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,939
running such code, so more advanced capabilities,

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,319
and even managing all of that can prove quite difficult.

137
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,699
And then last but not least,

138
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,290
uh, you need to be able to observe your agent,

139
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,459
right? So you need to know what your agent

140
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,619
is doing, what steps it's taking, how

141
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,048
it's reasoning,

142
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,000
where it's going well, where it's going wrong,

143
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,019
and you need observability for that.

144
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,238
And doing all of this out of, uh,

145
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,358
how to say, um,

146
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,660
reinventing the wheel on all of this can be

147
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,569
quite challenging,

148
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,600
and that's why

149
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,769
we have released Amazon Bedrock Agent Core,

150
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,100
which is a set of AWS services that

151
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,449
help you with those challenges.

152
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,660
So Bedrock Agent Corps has services in 3

153
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,319
categories

154
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,738
deploying your agents, enhancing your agent,

155
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,319
and monitoring your agents.

156
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,028
So for deploying your agents,

157
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,069
Bedrock Agent Corp provided two families of services,

158
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:39,069
the runtime and identity.

159
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,809
So the runtime is a capability that

160
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,250
allows you to provide your agent

161
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,509
code. So you simply bring the core to

162
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,139
Agent Core,

163
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,649
including the framework that you need to use and

164
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,730
the model that you need to use. It can be any

165
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,790
framework, any model

166
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,290
on AWS or also not on

167
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,329
AWS Bedrock.

168
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,910
And uh um Agent Core

169
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,149
will basically take care of running

170
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,230
this for you on a server less run time

171
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,588
that scales as needed.

172
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And then you have agent core identity. So

173
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,778
think about your agent being

174
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,798
able to interact with the various tools.

175
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,459
This agent needs identities, right? It

176
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,480
needs an identity that the services

177
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,439
it interact with

178
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,699
will use to authenticate the agent.

179
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,059
And then it also needs potentially federation

180
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,170
with things like

181
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:24,319
CGV4,

182
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,660
OA, or API keys, and Bedrock

183
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Agent Corp provide all of these as part

184
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,759
of the identity part.

185
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,660
All right, so with these new components, you have the

186
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,738
possibility to run your agents

187
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:36,439
at scale,

188
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,220
and what comes next? So you need your agents

189
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,278
to be able to

190
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:41,899
access various tools.

191
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,209
And for that, the main component is the

192
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,488
agent core gateway. So the agent core gateway

193
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,670
is basically a central MCP server

194
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,048
where you can see, and the agent

195
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,329
can see all the tools that are available for the agent

196
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,798
to use, and those tools are called targets.

197
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,209
And those targets can be APIs, can be

198
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,608
databases that your agent will query, can

199
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,809
be also external tools like a Google Drive

200
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:04,889
or Salesforce or Slack that

201
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,470
your agent will interact with.

202
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,588
And then you have agent core memory where you

203
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,910
have short-term memory and long-term

204
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,910
memory. Think about an agent

205
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,028
doing transactions on an e-commerce

206
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,149
website. So this agent

207
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,689
would have a shorter memory,

208
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,309
and this shorter memory allows the agent to remember

209
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,588
what products are being added to the shopping cart,

210
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,470
who is the user making the shopping, how many

211
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,670
products have been added, where to ship them

212
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,088
before actually placing the order.

213
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,608
And then you have long-term memory.

214
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,149
Long-term memory is basically about

215
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,309
the agent remembering past

216
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,389
interactions so that any new

217
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:42,639
shopping experience in the future, for example,

218
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,449
can be personalized based on the user preference

219
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:47,009
and the past interactions.

220
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,100
And then you may need the agent

221
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,129
to do more advanced things, for example,

222
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,559
accessing the browser,

223
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,059
and there we have an Agent Core browser,

224
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
which is a fully managed browser

225
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,220
within the agent core service that scales

226
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,329
to 10s or hundreds of parallel

227
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,850
sessions, all isolated where

228
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,298
your agent can interact with the web

229
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,428
applications. And then if you need

230
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,949
things like code execution,

231
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,189
we have the agent core code interpreter.

232
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,040
So the idea here is that language

233
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,059
models are very

234
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,838
effective in generating code,

235
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,199
but they are not necessarily the best tool in

236
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,939
doing deterministic things, for example, calculations.

237
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,358
So think about an LLM then generating

238
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:27,220
a code

239
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,559
for a calculator in Python, and then

240
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,639
this code will be executed in the

241
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,759
agent core code interpreter to get

242
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,349
a deterministic calculation of

243
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,960
let's say, a mathematical expression.

244
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:41,359
So this is the idea. And now you have your agent

245
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,438
running securely, you have your agent

246
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:44,869
announced with additional tools.

247
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,587
How do you ensure that this is working well?

248
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,239
How do you monitor it once it's operate once

249
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,258
it's operational?

250
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,678
So for that you can use uh Bedrock

251
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:55,460
Agent Core

252
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,129
observability, which is the capability

253
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,418
that allows you to monitor the status

254
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,058
and the performance of your agent.

255
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,320
So, Agent Core observability

256
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,178
gives you a dashboard for basic observability.

257
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,820
But also and most importantly for this session,

258
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,099
it exposes a number of

259
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,219
let's say matrix,

260
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,279
logs,

261
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,658
spans, traces, and

262
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:18,440
sessions

263
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,979
that Dyna Trace would then use to do the

264
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:23,080
more advanced observability via their platform.

265
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,320
And now Sean will talk about this part.

266
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,739
So in, in, in the case of, of what we

267
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:29,399
are

268
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,739
expanding upon, and what I actually appreciate

269
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,820
from an AWS perspective is I've

270
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,099
been in the observability space for about 8 or 9 years

271
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,219
now. And when, when we

272
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:40,369
look at each of these new technologies, the,

273
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,440
the really the challenge has always been.

274
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,450
As a developer, as a consumer,

275
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,928
as a, as an end-user practitioner, is,

276
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,769
how do I get the information out of it?

277
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,129
Now, DynaTrace, obviously focusing on

278
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,570
end to end observability,

279
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,428
we have a care and a concern

280
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,250
of that exact problem or challenge,

281
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,639
depending on how you look at it.

282
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,168
And, and the way AWS is built, both

283
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,070
Agent core.

284
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:06,808
Uh, and specifically some of the other things around,

285
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,058
uh, the other announcement this week for the DevOps

286
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,210
agent specifically

287
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,509
is giving the power to you as the

288
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,509
end user, as the developer of

289
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:16,548
where you want to get the information from.

290
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,149
Obviously, CloudWatch, fantastic.

291
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,548
I'm a big fan of it. If you need to expand

292
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,769
this beyond CloudWatch, obviously, uh, I

293
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,869
believe in uh Simone's slide it mentioned

294
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,389
open telemetry, specifically those logs,

295
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:29,849
those traces, metrics.

296
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,529
We as at Dynatrace believe you can

297
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,529
bring those in beyond just

298
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,779
the scope of Bedrock Agent Core.

299
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,408
And we do this in a couple of ways. I personally

300
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:41,750
focus in and around AI observability

301
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:44,428
and specifically, yes, based upon my title,

302
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,969
the Developer Experience. So in my world,

303
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,479
it's not about dashboards,

304
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,879
it's not about The power of a dashboard,

305
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,609
it's let me start in my IDE.

306
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,178
Let me get the information when and where I want

307
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:56,259
to, but at the end of the day

308
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,119
we all know we have to see the data, and I think that's

309
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,580
where I love about CloudWatch.

310
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,960
Obviously seeing the Cloud Watch specific data

311
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,798
for Agent Corp plus DynaTrace.

312
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
So when we look at this a little bit further, there

313
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,779
are some challenges.

314
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,408
While, while you and I probably care

315
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:13,580
about, uh, you know, uh, Agent Core, Bedrock

316
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,960
Agent Corre specifically,

317
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,019
we realize that our enterprises, our

318
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,099
organizations leverage far more than just

319
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:20,788
this new

320
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:22,788
technology and or application.

321
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,250
So at DynaTrace, our goal is to

322
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,769
really take that and abstract or

323
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,769
not abstract it, but provide value

324
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,604
to. it. And so in this slide,

325
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,144
our idea is, hey, we've got cloud native

326
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,734
digital services, we've got,

327
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:37,384
you know, AI agents,

328
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,933
we all need to communicate together. I was having

329
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,945
a conversation earlier this morning, and

330
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,974
we still have applications that are

331
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,254
sitting on mainframes, etc. so

332
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,354
on. And so what we want to make sure is you have

333
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,484
visibility to all of this.

334
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,489
Depending on your use case and scenario,

335
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,729
you might say, I only care about

336
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:57,798
an agent that sits in my IDE and I'm

337
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,668
never going anywhere else. Perfect.

338
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,808
I believe Simona and the AWS team have built a fantastic

339
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,849
way to do that. If you need to go beyond that,

340
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,090
that's where we sit. That's our goal for

341
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,509
end to end observability.

342
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,279
I want to mention two things,

343
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,389
and, and I think this is an interesting

344
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,489
slide or an interesting statistic

345
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:17,788
is that 95% of AI

346
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:18,609
pilots

347
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,989
are failing. Now, I don't know if I

348
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:23,139
actually agree holistically just based upon

349
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:23,779
the conversation.

350
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:25,330
Maybe it's a little bit.

351
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,019
Loose or maybe it's historical data,

352
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,519
but the intelligence that Agent Core

353
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,599
provides, I actually believe lends to

354
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,719
a better success.

355
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:37,000
But along with that information is leveraging

356
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,200
an open source solution like open open

357
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,119
telemetry

358
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,719
allows for the consumption of that information.

359
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,769
The catch here is because we're talking about um

360
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,908
experimental or development. This

361
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:49,950
is not a day 2 conversation. This is

362
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,149
a day 0

363
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,029
conversation. And where we at Dyna Trace believe

364
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,250
and obviously in AWS believe is

365
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,950
those numbers are gonna continue to improve

366
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,950
from a failure rate. The second thing I would

367
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,849
mention here,

368
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:04,700
as a developer, and this is where I, I,

369
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,129
I, you know, I focus,

370
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,428
I'm not looking for complexity.

371
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,928
I don't wanna have to go from this screen to this

372
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,369
screen or from this IDE

373
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,779
to another option.

374
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,090
I, I want it to be where I am and

375
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,408
we at Diana Trace believe we wanna meet you

376
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,009
at that location. So whether it's your IDE,

377
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,288
obviously we had the announcement yesterday, um,

378
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,399
in conjunction with AWS around Quiro,

379
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,869
the, the idea is to, to meet you

380
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:30,190
in that specific uh

381
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,379
location. The other thing about this is

382
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,000
many organizations, uh, and probably

383
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,279
all of you in this room

384
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,779
are leveraging more than simply

385
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,359
Bedrock Agent Core.

386
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:43,099
You're testing multiple LLMs, you're testing,

387
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,359
um, small language models. You have a

388
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,038
variety of consumption.

389
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,599
And so what we want to uh help you

390
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,428
understand is not only

391
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,330
Bedrock Age at core,

392
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,609
but we also realize you have all of these others.

393
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,590
And so whether it's some of the third parties,

394
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,109
uh, Nvidia is a specific is another

395
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,210
great example. Our goal is

396
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,330
to meet you at DynaTrace, where

397
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,109
you are.

398
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,609
And so from an observability perspective, yes,

399
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,570
I have two different agentic applications.

400
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,524
Maybe one is Amazon, maybe the other one's, you

401
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,945
know, leveraging in video technology or anthropic

402
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:16,014
or OpenAI or one of the many vendors

403
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,085
on the floors today

404
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:19,585
is we want you to be able to have visibility

405
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,163
and understanding of both of those.

406
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:23,465
And so at Dina Trace, our goal is

407
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:25,705
just to continue to meet you where

408
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:27,933
you are. We're doing this in two different ways.

409
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,945
Obviously open telemetry, as I mentioned.

410
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,570
And open LL imagery,

411
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,759
and I always have a funny way I say this, but I'm going to

412
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,769
be nice and, and, and put it in the proper

413
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:37,408
term today.

414
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,070
So this is where we

415
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,038
believe observability goes beyond just agent

416
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,239
core. And so just depending on where you are

417
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,450
and where you need to be met.

418
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,984
The last The thing I wanted to show is a very simple

419
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:50,004
screen. Um, I am

420
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:52,205
sitting here in, uh, you know, a very

421
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,144
simple to understand and as you can tell,

422
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,715
this is, this happens to be the DynaTrace dashboard.

423
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:58,764
What I want to articulate here is I've got

424
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,033
a couple of tasks. I've got some chats, I've got some mention

425
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:01,923
and information,

426
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:04,404
and at the end of the day, hey, this is a lane graph

427
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,565
workflow. I see that, I see

428
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:10,043
the relative and appropriate observability

429
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,283
information in this example, followed by, hey,

430
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:14,524
what are some of the details, some of the metadata and the

431
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:15,683
attributes, etc.

432
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,750
This is a visual representation,

433
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,349
right? I love to sit in my ID

434
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:22,989
using natural language search.

435
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,379
I want to be able to do this from my IDE

436
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,609
and obviously the integration with an MCP

437
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:30,109
from an AWS perspective, from a Dynatrace

438
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,090
perspective is now I can get it in a GUI,

439
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,570
but I can also get it inside of my

440
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,899
preferred location, right? Whether it's Quiro,

441
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:39,178
whether it's, uh, you know, VS code

442
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:41,200
or Windsurf or depending on what you're using.

443
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,649
And so that is our goal to meet

444
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,908
you, not only from an agent core agent

445
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:46,658
perspective,

446
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,989
but the variety of LLMs

447
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,210
and observability or excuse me, the LLMs,

448
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,649
um, small language models and

449
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,349
AI capabilities, right?

450
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,668
In every one of our organizations, the other

451
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:58,570
side of this is,

452
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,830
what if I'm leveraging another solution.

453
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:03,053
like a Service now or a,

454
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,455
uh, you know, it could be a

455
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,533
variety of the ecosystem. Our

456
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,734
goal is to provide you the information

457
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,215
from an observability perspective, not only for

458
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:14,293
Agent Core, but beyond in the

459
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,293
same fashion that's usable and

460
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,375
predictable for you. And we, and

461
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,955
as developers and engineers

462
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,894
love some decent predictability, at least I

463
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,394
hope you do. Uh, the last thing I would mention

464
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:26,433
at Dyna Trace,

465
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,715
just to summarize this.

466
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,070
We're about experience. I was having a

467
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,129
conversation last night, you know, one of the things that that

468
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,250
we, we struggle with in the industry

469
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,389
is complexity.

470
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:40,668
As a developer, as an engineer,

471
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,450
I want to reduce complexity. I want to be back in

472
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,899
the flow. I want to,

473
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,408
I realize I have to troubleshoot. I have to

474
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:49,548
debug because things are going to happen.

475
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,210
But the quickest way for me to get in

476
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,519
and out of a debug mode,

477
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:55,928
troubleshooting mode.

478
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,509
is to do it in a quick instant in, in,

479
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,298
in really

480
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:01,719
simple to easy to use fashion. And so one

481
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,379
of the things we've continued to build upon

482
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,318
as the agent core team and as the, as the

483
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,588
Bedrock team has developed this, is to

484
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:10,660
ensure usability or experience.

485
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,959
And so whether that's developer experience and beyond.

486
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,199
I think the last piece I would mention before we

487
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,939
close it out

488
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,279
is all of this runs on

489
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,229
infrastructure.

490
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,640
Now as a developer, do I love to

491
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,769
interact with infrastructure? Probably

492
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,848
not. Maybe I have to, but

493
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,920
it's all been abstracted to me. But

494
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,348
from an observability perspective, I care,

495
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,608
and I, it's a concern to me. And what

496
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,848
we realize is from an end to end observability

497
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,368
perspective, it's not just the LL.

498
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,375
or the AI observability. It's not just

499
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,535
the logs, traces and metrics.

500
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:45,104
It's the relative infrastructure

501
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,203
information and relative infrastructure data

502
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:48,625
in context.

503
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,025
And so having each of these layers,

504
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,184
right, depending on your scenario, depending on the

505
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,035
use case, depending on the problem,

506
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,684
we want to meet you where you are.

507
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,025
And every job, every developer I talked to about

508
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,184
this, in some cases, it's, I

509
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:03,525
need to start with logs.

510
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:06,890
Or I need to start with a metric

511
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,309
or a span. For the record, there is no

512
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,348
single point that I have ever found in

513
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,630
this. It really depends on the day, it

514
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,660
depends on the scenario, and in the

515
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,029
situation. And so we want to do is make it readily

516
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,489
available and easy to you.

517
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,489
Because it would never be the AWS infrastructure

518
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,150
and it would never be the network, right?

519
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,588
But we want to make sure you start where you

520
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,029
need to be and that's how we, we position

521
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,068
this as the data trace difference.

522
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,588
Lastly, I will say this, come meet us at the booth.

523
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,750
The team has got about 2 more hours, well. I

524
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,368
got about an hour and a half now to go,

525
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,709
but we have a, a free giveaway at a raffle

526
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,709
here in about 10 minutes. So if you want to run

527
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,789
by there, have a conversation with myself,

528
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,299
have a conversation with Simone,

529
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,789
or join the raffle and win some things, we

530
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,269
would love to have you. But I would say this last and

531
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,009
not least.

532
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,789
It has been a long week.

533
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:55,199
We at Dina Trace and at Data Buss realize

534
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:55,979
it's been long.

535
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,400
You've been in a lot of meetings. You've been in a lot of

536
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,519
sessions, but I wanna say thank you for stopping

537
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,259
by towards the end of the day.

538
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,959
Come find us, come find me, come find Simone.

539
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,318
We'd love to talk with you, and we hope you have a great

540
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,439
trip home, and we'll see you again next year.
