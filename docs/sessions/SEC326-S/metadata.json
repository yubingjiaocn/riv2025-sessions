  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 让攻击者哭泣：用欺骗技术智胜他们 (SEC326)",
  "abstract": "Cyber attacks are conducted by humans, not machines, and we can apply principles about the ways humans behave to fight back. Deception involves the subtle and strategic redirection of potential attackers with carefully crafted misinformation or simulated behaviors. It introduces confusion, friction, and frustration for cyber attackers, which often leads them to stop their attacks and move on to easier targets. Join this session to learn about how to turn the tables on attackers by using their own curiosity and persistence against them. You’ll learn how to bolster your security and fuel more intelligent and adaptive security measures. This presentation is brought to you by Fastly, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "网络攻击是由人类而非机器实施的，我们可以运用人类行为原理来进行反击。欺骗技术涉及通过精心设计的错误信息或模拟行为对潜在攻击者进行巧妙而战略性的重定向。它为网络攻击者带来困惑、阻力和挫败感，通常会导致他们停止攻击并转向更容易的目标。参加本次会议，了解如何利用攻击者自身的好奇心和持续性来扭转局面。您将学习如何加强安全防护并推动更智能、更具适应性的安全措施。本演示由AWS合作伙伴Fastly为您呈现。",
