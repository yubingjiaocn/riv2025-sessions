1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,508
All right, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,179
Appreciate everybody taking the time to be, uh,

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:06,299
with us for this session.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,970
We're gonna, uh, go into some detail

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,079
as it relates to EverCommerce's,

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:14,269
uh, journey from a data

7
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,810
modernization effort.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,719
Um,

9
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:19,208
let me start by introducing myself. I'm John

10
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,708
Sedlak with 5TR. I'm the vice president

11
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,260
of enterprise sales.

12
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,208
Um, and with me is Kalpit Patel,

13
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,489
uh, vice president of data and analytics

14
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,690
with, with EverCommerce. So we're

15
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,728
excited to be here. We've got a, a, a really

16
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,929
great, uh, lineup of questions. We're gonna go into

17
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:35,469
some detail.

18
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,848
Um, but let me start,

19
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,389
uh, for some of you that aren't familiar

20
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:42,329
with 5TR as a company,

21
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,868
um, we are a data

22
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:47,060
ingestion, data movement company focused

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,289
on automated,

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,770
secure, and scalable

25
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,130
data movement.

26
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:53,149
Um,

27
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,348
you'll see here we're about 1500

28
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,329
employees around the world.

29
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,168
Um,

30
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:03,429
and we focus on, um, specifically.

31
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:06,290
Operational data stores,

32
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,409
SAS applications.

33
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,859
We also work around, um,

34
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,400
uh, data tooling.

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,859
So the portfolio that we use

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,698
is, is broad as you can see. Oh, sorry,

37
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,838
I'm leaving you guys hanging with that. There you go.

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,219
Um,

39
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,519
it's very broad as far as the portfolio.

40
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,918
We have about 700 pre-built connectors

41
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,620
that our customers leverage.

42
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,219
Uh, think about things like, uh,

43
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,239
Salesforce and Zendesk,

44
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:33,549
Workday,

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,659
Google Ads from SAS key SAS

46
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,980
applications all the way through to

47
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,439
large operational data stores like

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,719
Oracle, SQL,

49
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,049
Sybase,

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,400
uh, DB2, and the list goes on.

51
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,719
Um,

52
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,299
we have about 7000 customers that

53
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,579
trust 5 Trans technology and 5

54
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,599
Trans teams

55
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,019
throughout the world, and we have a

56
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,900
global footprint both in North America,

57
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,418
Europe, and, uh, and Asia

58
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,739
Pacific, so you can see just a listing

59
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:04,099
of some of the, uh, the customers in

60
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,909
addition to EverCommerce

61
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,300
that, uh, have put, uh,

62
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,360
their business and their data movement,

63
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,000
um, business in the hands of,

64
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:13,960
of FiveTran.

65
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,528
So I'm gonna real quick talk about how

66
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,778
do we do this?

67
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,199
And then we'll jump into the

68
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,699
conversation with uh Kyle Pitt. So, as you

69
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:24,360
see here,

70
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,338
As it relates to AWS I'm gonna try to get

71
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,860
as specific as I can.

72
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,300
When you look on the left-hand side of the slide,

73
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,159
you'll see

74
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:34,770
that begins to indicate the portfolio

75
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,038
of source systems

76
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,338
that we move, right? You can see

77
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:39,800
everything from again,

78
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,409
operational data stores, SAS applications,

79
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:44,618
even digital tooling like GitHubs

80
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:45,580
and so forth.

81
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,979
The magic happens on the inside, right? Again,

82
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,110
as I mentioned earlier, 5TR has

83
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,449
automated, scalable,

84
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:54,949
and secure data pipelines. These are what we

85
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,449
deploy for our customers

86
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,500
to accelerate time to value,

87
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,270
speed to value, reducing overhead,

88
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:02,508
reducing cost.

89
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:04,304
These. Are maintained

90
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:05,524
by 5TR,

91
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:08,085
right? So these are automated pipelines. There's

92
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,224
no more management.

93
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,633
There's no more costs related to that. There's

94
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,724
no more schema drifts. All of these

95
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,064
things are automatically,

96
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:17,564
uh, accommodated and engineered

97
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,304
for as part of our platform.

98
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,264
We will ingest and move that data into.

99
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,439
Storage systems like S3 and we'll talk

100
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,520
a little bit more about that and the outputs as

101
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,719
you see on the far right hand side to speed

102
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,618
through this is

103
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,979
supporting everything from real-time analytics,

104
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,819
business operations, cloud migrations,

105
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,879
and what everybody is excited

106
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,368
about around AI and ML,

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,819
um, as well.

108
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,719
So with that,

109
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,288
I think what we'll do is we'll sit down, we'll

110
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,460
have a chit chat. Is that good for you?

111
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,229
Um,

112
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,770
and we'll talk a little bit with, with Capil

113
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,490
about why don't we start with you just introducing

114
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,830
yourself, uh, and your role at EverCommerce.

115
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,528
Perfect. Thank you so much, John. Uh, good

116
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,028
morning. Good afternoon, everybody.

117
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,439
My name is Kalpit Patel. I'm the VP

118
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,508
of enterprise data

119
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,368
at a company called EverCommerce.

120
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,758
Not sure if you guys know about EverCommerce,

121
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,808
uh, but, uh, we are an interesting

122
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:14,750
company. We are a

123
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:16,100
leading, uh.

124
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,358
Service commerce platform that

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,819
are digital native.

126
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
We provide solutions to

127
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,178
small business owners.

128
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,439
We are in about 40+ countries,

129
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,920
about 700,000 customers.

130
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,709
We really are very unique

131
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,358
in providing services to our customers

132
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,014
and our Purpose is very simple

133
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,994
to empower and digitally

134
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,035
make the service owners of this

135
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,233
small company very savvy. They

136
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,814
should not be worried about

137
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:46,994
what they

138
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,074
have to deal with from a technology landscape.

139
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,553
They just have to worry about running their businesses,

140
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,334
and that's what we really strive on.

141
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,480
So Capil, maybe

142
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:58,798
we could start

143
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,178
with, uh, sharing with

144
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,920
everybody here about, you know, with

145
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,199
the uniqueness of 50+

146
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,000
organizations,

147
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,500
um, and, and, you know, all

148
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,920
of them being kind of independently operated,

149
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,678
um,

150
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,178
what was the data infrastructure like as

151
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,209
you approach this modernization effort?

152
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:18,238
What was the original

153
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,869
state? So I was like every

154
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:22,358
other companies, right, uh,

155
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,019
when you go through buying portfolio of companies,

156
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,149
you really have to deal with, uh,

157
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,298
three different nuances, right?

158
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,379
People process,

159
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,059
technology, everybody knows it,

160
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,750
right? But when you look at the data infrastructure

161
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,470
at scale,

162
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,814
you. Think about silos of data,

163
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,653
duplications of data, right?

164
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,553
Really making sure the harmonization

165
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:43,774
is done properly.

166
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,053
But when I joined the organization about 18

167
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:46,725
months back,

168
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,694
it really struck me when I did about 60

169
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:52,053
interviews in my 1st 3 months, I went on a listening

170
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,358
tour. That we are a very data

171
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:55,500
hungry company.

172
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,798
And in order to turn that vision

173
00:05:57,798 --> 00:05:59,019
from a data hungry

174
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,588
to a data enterprise and a data-led

175
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,720
company, you really need to provide

176
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,798
accessibility to

177
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,160
to data with the speed of light. And that's

178
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,259
how we really started our journey on

179
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,519
what I call is

180
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,838
AKA data factory. We will talk

181
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,439
more about what a data factories.

182
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,350
So you had these, you had these many,

183
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,189
many organizations, data hungry,

184
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,790
but there was really no organization

185
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,709
or plan, if you will, around

186
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,009
how to consolidate those from a

187
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,850
silo perspective into something more centralized.

188
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,588
Is that fair?

189
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,970
Yes, so again, like you know, for

190
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,869
within our commerce,

191
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,410
we don't say centralization. We

192
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,548
really say we are an

193
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,220
Enablement center because our goal is to really enable

194
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,319
the businesses and take them to

195
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,699
the next level whether it's in terms of

196
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,959
technology, but we are not building just a data

197
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,129
factory, we are enabling the future

198
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,939
of what our customers

199
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,199
want and need from us with the speed

200
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,738
of light.

201
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,720
Great, great segue. So as the business

202
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,579
scaled.

203
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,540
What were some of the,

204
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,858
the biggest challenges as you kind of

205
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,199
describe yourself getting

206
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,079
involved and doing a lot of interviews and understanding

207
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,358
the current state, but what were some of the biggest challenges

208
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,619
that you encountered with that decentralized

209
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:15,019
data? And then now here comes the plug for 5Tran.

210
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,079
Talk a little bit about how the managed data lake

211
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,459
service helped you accelerate that.

212
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:20,949
Perfect, right? So. Uh,

213
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,600
the three things that always comes

214
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,009
to data infrastructure and building

215
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,649
intelligence layer is, uh,

216
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,988
you first have to understand the business, right?

217
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,660
Everybody wants to do digital transformation,

218
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,819
right? But if you don't understand the

219
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:35,809
business landscape,

220
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,540
what the company is made up of, right,

221
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,500
it's going to be a very challenging task.

222
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,980
So for us, it's not about the issues on

223
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,019
hand, it's about the opportunities that brings

224
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,225
us and the. Opportunities are endless, right?

225
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:49,466
So having data in multiple

226
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,264
layouts, multiple formats,

227
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,055
because we, we bought a portfolio

228
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,505
of companies, it really is about

229
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:57,406
having them

230
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:59,704
all de-siloed. That's number one.

231
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,644
Second is, how do you provide

232
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:04,425
data accessibility as we talked about, right?

233
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,906
The third is, how do you really put

234
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:09,105
governance on top of all of this

235
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:10,185
in the world of AI,

236
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,971
right? Everybody. lacks two major

237
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:13,901
scenarios,

238
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:15,690
which is how do you bring data

239
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,341
together and how do you create a data

240
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:19,110
foundation

241
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,610
with a quality and a governed infrastructure.

242
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,752
Because once you have that, and that

243
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:26,151
we are calling it as a data factory. That's

244
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,151
our foundation. Our goal is to build a

245
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,081
factory. That's number 1 phase.

246
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,671
Second is lay the machinery in the factory.

247
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,030
And then the 3rd is build a factory and make

248
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,038
it ready. For rollout, right? So

249
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,197
those are the three phrases.

250
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:39,577
Uh, with FIRN,

251
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,148
we have been working with FITR for almost about

252
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,356
8, 10 years now.

253
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,038
Last year when I joined the organization, we

254
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,207
took a very strategic approach with FIRun.

255
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,918
Rather than using FIR in

256
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:51,626
individual companies,

257
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,038
we actually molded ourselves to

258
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,496
say, how can we use Fran

259
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,876
to build a data factory, empower

260
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,883
it. So we started. Using their

261
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,883
product called Managed Data Lake, right?

262
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:06,082
Our whole infrastructure and the platform

263
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,163
that we are building

264
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:09,913
is completely open data platform

265
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,043
on Apache iceberg, using,

266
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,222
uh, and leveraging the technologies of,

267
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:16,283
uh, PR, but we are building it on

268
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,472
the AWS S3 Foundation.

269
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:21,244
That's super rock solid, and foundational

270
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,702
in nature, and it provides the resiliency

271
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,082
and the infrastructure that we need.

272
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,109
Then with Fran,

273
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,808
right? It was always a question about should we

274
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,808
build it or should we buy it, as we have

275
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:32,879
been using F train,

276
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,210
we really decided to say, how

277
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,070
can we provide

278
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,399
acceleration,

279
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,629
speed, and the momentum

280
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,950
that the business has been hungry for

281
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,330
since so many years, right? So we decided to

282
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,418
use that approach, and then we started

283
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,849
really integrating all of these desperate sources,

284
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,969
leveraging fighter and managed data lake.

285
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:53,389
So we talked,

286
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:54,440
you talked

287
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,460
a bit about the technical implementations,

288
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,298
maybe talk a little bit about, you know, now with

289
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,359
the large portfolio of companies, how does that

290
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,359
affect cross-brand

291
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,099
visibility?

292
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,229
How does that

293
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,879
affect, you know, again, going back to the managed data lake

294
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,000
and the technology decisions, how does that

295
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,119
affect cross-selling, upselling

296
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,548
with utilizing that data? How has

297
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,739
that affected the business?

298
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:19,629
So again, like, you know, when you build a vision for

299
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:20,590
data factory,

300
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,168
right, uh, today, we are

301
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:25,668
able to run the mission

302
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,788
and the vision of our commerce. We are able to do

303
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:28,469
the reporting,

304
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,989
but it's not at the level that we

305
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:33,070
want, uh, in terms of empowerment

306
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,349
of our customers, right? So, when we enable

307
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:36,379
the data factory,

308
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,330
now we are able to

309
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,710
build once and consume many times.

310
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,145
So when Talk about data assets. You're

311
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:44,927
bringing in data assets. You are

312
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,546
governing those data assets. You are providing

313
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,326
quality on those data assets,

314
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:51,985
right, in one lens, rather

315
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,626
than having 1020, 30 different

316
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,427
systems that are disintegrated,

317
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,105
right? So for a perfect example is today

318
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:00,405
because of the data factory,

319
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,927
we will now have a

320
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:02,886
very

321
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:05,663
focused view on how is the. Targeting

322
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,563
working right? What is our

323
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:10,342
achievement scores, right? How is the funnel working?

324
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:11,462
What is the lead generation,

325
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:14,263
right? We can now start putting more

326
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:16,572
lens around enterprise reporting.

327
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,183
How can we have standardized data definitions?

328
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,744
Everybody just focuses on the

329
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:22,663
technology side of the house.

330
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,364
For us, it was more around the change management,

331
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:27,783
really making sure that the business has the

332
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:30,100
buy-in. It's not about. Rolling out data

333
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,541
factory. It's about solving the business

334
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,139
problems that we see currently,

335
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,330
but also build the data factory that is built

336
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,370
for the future, that is

337
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,460
AI enabled, but it also has an AI

338
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,620
migration lens coming from

339
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,879
legacy as well, right? So

340
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,421
more enterprise lands,

341
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,980
build once, consume many times, and

342
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,019
also provide self-service applicability

343
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,240
to our business users.

344
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,619
And then kind of

345
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,239
now pivoting over to the, to the

346
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,918
Amazon, the S3 side.

347
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:00,830
What was,

348
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:03,580
what was your decision process like to choose

349
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,450
S3 from a, a storage perspective?

350
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,580
So, uh.

351
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:11,058
In our current landscape, we

352
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:13,099
have AWS, we have Azure, we have a

353
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,529
lot of other cloud providers,

354
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:17,099
but, uh, because we

355
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,450
have been working with AWS for quite a while,

356
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,979
we wanted a rock solid foundation

357
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,200
layer, right? For us,

358
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:26,399
everything has to be fundamentally.

359
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,830
In a shape that you are not just

360
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,830
able to bring the data, but you are able to

361
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,830
transform, you are able to mold it, and

362
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,830
S3 provides us that when you,

363
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,469
when you have about 100 different connectors

364
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,330
that you are running

365
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,788
on a minute, on a 10 minutes, on an

366
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:42,989
hour scale, you really want that

367
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:45,330
integration to be flawless, and S3

368
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,585
is probably one of Best engines that are out

369
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,614
there. So if you couple that

370
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,825
with fight and managed data lake,

371
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,494
building medallion architectures on an

372
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:56,683
open architecture using Apache iceberg,

373
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:59,125
now you're not just building for the future,

374
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:01,465
but you are building for use cases that

375
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,663
might come when you're

376
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:05,465
looking at the infrastructure from a scale.

377
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,229
You, you, you answered the, the follow-on

378
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,349
question I was gonna ask you just around how 5-chan

379
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:13,489
helped accelerate that centralization

380
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,590
and, and, uh, you know, you talked about

381
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,250
the managed

382
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,538
data lake service. Are there any other

383
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,548
projects specific to, as we're talking

384
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,750
about managed data lake service, we're

385
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,869
talking about S3, any future

386
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:27,908
projects that you can kind of describe to

387
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,070
the audience, uh, you know, that you

388
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,149
have uh in the roadmap as it relates

389
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,461
to that? So I think from a future. Project

390
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:36,900
perspective, as I said, our, uh, goal

391
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,541
first was to lay out the factory.

392
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,621
Now that we are done with that goal,

393
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,541
we are really empowering and enabling

394
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,741
our infrastructure to be AI and ML

395
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,780
ready. All right? Uh, what does that

396
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,400
mean is

397
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,971
today, if we have to look at customer churn

398
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,062
or customer retention because the data was

399
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:55,221
in so many different landscape, it was

400
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,421
very hard to do that.

401
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,741
Now that we are bringing the data in one

402
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:00,802
place, we can really run

403
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,701
sophisticated.

404
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:03,592
algorithms

405
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:06,572
across the portfolio of companies to see, for

406
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,972
example, if a culprit was buying

407
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,624
product 17, and 10,

408
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,092
now we have full visibility into how

409
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:15,013
can you do upsell, cross sell,

410
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,322
propensity,

411
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,244
customer churn, retention

412
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:20,572
in terms of Pre helping us,

413
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:24,013
we also are planning to leverage Fran ecosystems

414
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,092
holistically. We are a big DBT

415
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:28,092
shop right now with the integration of Fran

416
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:28,773
and DBT

417
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,306
that is going. To accelerate us in our journey

418
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:34,605
in automating a lot of what I call a shift

419
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,884
lap technology, right? Shift lap means you really

420
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,884
want to govern the data, qualify

421
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,264
the data as soon as you load them

422
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,985
and not bring them into your ecosystems

423
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,125
all the way on the tail end. So we are a

424
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,205
big fan of really doing

425
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:50,205
quality in shift lab when you

426
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:51,625
bring it from the source systems

427
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:53,945
because bad data is depth data, right? If

428
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:56,166
you bring in bad data, you'll have to really

429
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,046
pay a lot of debt.

430
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,469
So you began to, to touch on

431
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:01,269
a topic

432
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:04,029
that I wanted to bring us back to, uh, which

433
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,590
is that 360 degree journey.

434
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,090
So as some may know, the, uh,

435
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:11,369
you know, 5TR and DBT are in the

436
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:11,889
process

437
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,408
of, uh, becoming one company. So super

438
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,288
exciting and more, more of that is,

439
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,658
is unfolding here as the weeks go on.

440
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,129
But, uh, we've also gone through a

441
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,609
process of acquiring, uh, a company called Census

442
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,538
around. Uh, reverse ETL.

443
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,700
So when you think about that 360-degree

444
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,469
journey,

445
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,678
incorporating

446
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:31,849
the 5 trans,

447
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:33,940
the DBTs,

448
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,580
the census, how does that play into

449
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,658
the architecture that, that you've

450
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,119
already developed up to this point?

451
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:43,080
So I think with our commerce, as I said, we are

452
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,840
very unique.

453
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:46,279
We are a very digitally savvy company,

454
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,639
right? So we don't think technology first. We

455
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,840
think about what is the business transformation

456
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
that we want to lay out.

457
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,788
So from a future perspective,

458
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,469
we created something called DNA flywheel,

459
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,639
and the DNA flywheel really

460
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,359
understands who is the producer of the data,

461
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,259
who is going to consume that data, what.

462
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,500
And fight trains, sensors, DBT,

463
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,519
a lot of other technologies.

464
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:08,460
But for us,

465
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,119
we don't go to the business and say, here

466
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,320
are the technologies. We say we are building a

467
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
factory right for the future

468
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,440
that is the data factory, and the data

469
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,259
factory is powered by an engine

470
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
like Fran, like DVTs of the

471
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,099
world. That is to really make the

472
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:27,200
Life is easy for our engineers, right?

473
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:29,450
And then we are putting an AIML

474
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,570
on top of it with API as a

475
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,609
service data monetization, which

476
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,070
is our nirvana state going forward

477
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,288
to really see how can you enable

478
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,668
the businesses at scale. So it's all about

479
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,090
digitally savvy business

480
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,288
units driving forward innovation.

481
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:46,750
Amazing.

482
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,769
Um,

483
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,570
there's a lot there. You guys have, have

484
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,808
deployed a lot. You've, you've been with the company

485
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,889
for, uh, uh, not a long time, and

486
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,889
what you've accomplished with your team in

487
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,469
that short period of time is amazing

488
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,729
with partnering with the AWS

489
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,979
team, with the Five Tra team.

490
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,000
I know you have a, a whole series of other vendors

491
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,368
that have been a part of that as well, um.

492
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,979
We are going to, you know, there's a lot

493
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,640
that we talked about here and we're gonna make

494
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,670
everybody available to stop by our booth,

495
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,358
and I'll put it up here, booth 1660.

496
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,969
Uh, Capil will be there as well,

497
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,809
uh, to answer any questions,

498
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,088
um, as it relates to

499
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:28,509
the, the, uh, information that we shared today as

500
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,750
it relates to 5TR and what we're doing with

501
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,799
EverCommerce and what we're doing with some

502
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,140
of the other companies out there. So, um,

503
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:37,549
I wanna thank everybody for, uh, for joining

504
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:38,709
us. Appreciate it.

505
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:41,549
Thank you everybody, uh, for letting us share

506
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,640
our stories, right? And then, uh, thank you, Fran,

507
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,390
right, for being a good success partners, right, along

508
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,769
with AWS. Appreciate it.
