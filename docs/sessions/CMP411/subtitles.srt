1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
- Thank you all for coming to

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,600
Quantum Computing with Amazon Bracket:

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,100
From Exploration to Enterprise.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Eric Kessler.

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,330
I'm the general manager of Amazon Bracket,

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,280
our quantum computing service by AWS,

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,900
so you're gonna learn more about that,

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,940
but I'm very excited to be joined today

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,920
also by Michael Brett.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,790
He's the head of go-to-market
for quantum computing at AWS,

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,770
and yeah, we're gonna give you
a little bit of an overview,

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,260
what we have been up to at AWS,

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,920
how we see the industry evolve,

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,633
and what you can do today
already with this technology.

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,360
To give you a little bit, an overview,

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,330
what to expect today, I'm
gonna give you a little bit

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,460
of an introduction of
what is quantum computing

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,080
and where are we today.

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,900
Then we're gonna go into
a bit of an overview

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,300
of what we're doing at
AWS before we dive into

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,850
hybrid quantum classical workloads

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,790
and how we're supporting these type of

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,190
cutting-edge workloads at AWS.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,350
And finally, we're
looking at one particular

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,920
customer case study, which
was about drug design

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,000
with AstraZeneca.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,340
And finally, we're gonna show you

28
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,690
how you can get started
with quantum computing.

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,560
But I wanted to get out of the gate here

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,540
with addressing a very
common misconception

31
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,480
about quantum computing.

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,800
Namely, a quantum computer
is not a classical computer

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,870
that just runs a little bit faster.

34
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,280
As a matter of fact, quantum computers

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,980
are actually very slow
compared to the clock cycles

36
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,870
from classical computers.

37
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,790
Instead, a quantum computer
can run a richer class

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,210
of algorithms compared
to classical computers.

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,680
And you may ask, why do we need

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
a richer class of algorithms?

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,220
We have our classical algorithms
and they work just fine.

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,310
Well, it turns out there are
certain types of applications

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,830
where all the algorithms that we know

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,220
require an exponential overhead

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,410
as the problem gets bigger and bigger,

46
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,300
exponentially, the time that it needs,

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,240
the memory that it needs,
other resources that it needs.

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,810
And one of the prototypical
problems of that kind

49
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,870
is to simulate quantum systems themselves.

50
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,120
So this is kind of the
home turf applications

51
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,080
of quantum computers.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,450
Because when we just look at the system,

53
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,020
say particles, electrons, that behave,

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,660
that interact with each other,
behave quantum mechanically,

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,650
if we want to simulate them
with a classical computer,

56
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,720
already 50 of those particles require

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,600
supercomputing scale classical computing.

58
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
And because it is exponential,

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,180
if we go from 50 to 100 particles,

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,360
it becomes completely out of reach

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,160
for any computer today
and in the future, right?

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,160
And of course, this idea
is almost the founding idea

63
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,070
of quantum computing and
goes back a long time now

64
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,600
from 1981 by Richard Feynman
in this very famous quote

65
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,377
where he said, "Nature isn't classical

66
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,687
"and if you want to make
a simulation of nature,

67
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,750
"then you better make
it quantum mechanical."

68
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,520
And by golly, it's a wonderful problem

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,480
because it doesn't look so easy.

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,580
And that's true, it's
actually a very hard problem

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,480
to build a quantum computer.

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,850
And the technology is still early,

73
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,400
but we're seeing a lot
of improvements, right?

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,370
So as the take home message,

75
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,310
quantum computers can solve some problems

76
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,000
with exponentially fewer
gates or fewer operations

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,110
than classical computers

78
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,783
because they use different
types of algorithms.

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,410
So to put it in a very provocatively,

80
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,450
it's not a two X speed up,

81
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,000
but a two to the power
of X speed up, right?

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,230
And because it's exponential,

83
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,120
that's the difference between
something that's possible

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,200
and something that's
not possible to compute.

85
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,640
So from that very brief introductions,

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,150
there are actually some
very profound learnings

87
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,680
or lessons we can take, right?

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,500
Because quantum computers are
not just a classic computer

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,890
that runs faster, it
means also that quantum

90
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,930
will not replace classical
computers, right?

91
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,440
If you have a classical algorithm

92
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,040
that does not scale exponentially,

93
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,170
that works well for the
problem that you have,

94
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,090
there's no argument why
you would replace it

95
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,370
with a quantum computer because
they're generally slower,

96
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,020
they're generally more expensive.

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,050
The second point is that many use cases

98
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,870
of quantum computers are
hidden by definition.

99
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,010
And what do I mean with this, right?

100
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,330
If you look around at your company

101
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,280
and think about what are the applications

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,200
that a quantum computer could be used for,

103
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,770
chances are there are some
applications you don't see

104
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,690
because they are not possible to solve

105
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,790
with classical computers today, right?

106
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,060
Because by definition, we
wanna apply quantum computing

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,153
to problems that are hard
for classical computers.

108
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,330
And the final one is,

109
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,330
because we're talking about
a new class of algorithms,

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,730
these applications are not
just lift and shift, right?

111
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,070
When we have a quantum computer
at some point in the future

112
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,990
that can address
industry-relevant problems,

113
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,520
we cannot just take what we were running

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,660
on a classical computer before

115
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,240
and move it over to a quantum
computer and it will work.

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,530
These are completely new algorithms,

117
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,790
completely new primitives,

118
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,770
and it requires a lot of
talent and skills and IP

119
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,723
to develop these kind of algorithms.

120
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,250
And we're very excited
about these algorithms

121
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,070
because applications are applicable

122
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,010
to a wide field of verticals, right?

123
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,600
So we already talked about
the home turf kind of problems

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,530
on the left-hand side,

125
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,640
like problems where we
try to describe nature

126
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,130
for all intents and purposes
in physics and chemistry,

127
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,950
simulating molecules and
reactions, et cetera,

128
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,980
developing new materials
and material science.

129
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,310
But maybe very surprisingly,
it doesn't stop there, right?

130
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,490
Quantum computers are not
only exponentially faster

131
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,600
for these type of problems,
for some of these problems,

132
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,680
but there are also certain problems

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,130
that are inherently classical,
where it has been shown

134
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,650
that quantum computers
do provide an advantage.

135
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,490
Well, maybe the most famous
one is in cryptography, right,

136
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,770
where the Shor's algorithm showed

137
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,460
that you can factor large
numbers exponentially faster

138
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,960
than with a classical computer, right?

139
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,823
There's this relevance
for RSA and encryption

140
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:03,180
and so on and so forth, but
then there are also problems

141
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,340
in the space of optimization,

142
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,430
and machine learning is a
little bit more nuanced here,

143
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,030
and a lot of research is
being done in those topics.

144
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, all of this is to say that we at AWS

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
really think quantum computing

146
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,620
is a foundational compute technology,

147
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,110
and like with other compute technologies,

148
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,190
we want to bring these
capabilities to our customers,

149
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,790
and in the fullness of time,
make them part of our offering,

150
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,000
our compute fabric at AWS, right?

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,013
So in some sense,

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,350
our job at AWS is to make
quantum computing boring, right?

153
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,320
When you look at the accelerated
compute portfolio at AWS,

154
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,020
we have already different
types of accelerators,

155
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,300
from GPUs to AI and ML accelerators,

156
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,900
ASICs and FPGAs, and so on and so forth,

157
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,780
from different providers,
and in the fullness of time,

158
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,713
I think quantum is just
another type of accelerator.

159
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,840
But of course, it's a long
journey to that place,

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
and to throw a little bit of cold water,

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,690
I want to really stress that
the technology is early,

162
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,390
and today there is no quantum computer

163
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,780
that can solve any
industry-relevant problem

164
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,450
faster, cheaper, or more accurately

165
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,040
than the best classical alternative.

166
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,810
So then, what are customers
using quantum computers

167
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,220
for today, right?

168
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,093
Well, like any other technology,

169
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,180
quantum computing will not start

170
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,120
with the broad-scale adoption,

171
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,160
but it will start from niche applications

172
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,990
and gradually grow from there,

173
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,280
and I like to make the
analogy with GPUs, right?

174
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,280
GPUs started for a very
niche application space

175
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,730
of graphics processing, until,

176
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,410
researchers in academia realized

177
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,540
it can be used for
mathematical calculations,

178
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,370
big matrix multiplications, and so on,

179
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,040
until they finally got
the broad-scale adoptions

180
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,170
through AI and machine learning.

181
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,120
And in the same way,
quantum computers today,

182
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
what most of our customers do,

183
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,760
is using quantum computers
to study quantum computing,

184
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,720
right?

185
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,450
From researching the devices,
the sources of noise,

186
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,760
developing error mitigation protocols,

187
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,670
to researching these
novel types of algorithms,

188
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,260
trying to understand how they converge,

189
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,330
how they are impacted by this noise,

190
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,610
so trying to close the gap

191
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,320
between what the hardware
brings from the bottom

192
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,310
and what applications come from the top.

193
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,290
But of course, ultimately,

194
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,630
we don't wanna just
study the hammer, right?

195
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,250
We want to actually use the hammer, right?

196
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,480
Using quantum computers as a tool

197
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,510
to solve problems in other domains.

198
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,510
And the first areas where we will solve

199
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,540
different kind of problems

200
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,470
will be in the space of
scientific applications, right?

201
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,760
To drive new scientific
discovery in high-energy physics,

202
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,620
in material science, in
quantum materials, and so on,

203
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,740
before we go into this final step

204
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,160
into broadly industry-relevant problems

205
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,460
with broad-scale adoption.

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,470
And we are at a very exciting
time of the industry,

207
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,310
I think, right?

208
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,360
We are just at that cusp of going over

209
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,620
from studying the hammer

210
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,543
to using, actually, the hammer, right?

211
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,380
And against that backdrop,

212
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,600
I wanted to introduce you
to what we're doing at AWS

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,680
to help accelerate that technology

214
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,680
to help make that promise of
quantum computing a reality.

215
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,180
So in a nutshell, our
quantum technologies at AWS,

216
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,380
we have four pillars.

217
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,190
This is Amazon Bracket, our
quantum computing service.

218
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,080
You're gonna hear about that more.

219
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
We have the Amazon Advanced Solutions Lab.

220
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,160
This is a professional services team

221
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,530
that focuses on quantum computing

222
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,353
and related classical technologies.

223
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,683
And then we have the AWS
Center for Quantum Computing.

224
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,090
It's a research facility

225
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,030
where we're developing our
own quantum computing hardware

226
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,220
and quantum error correction technologies.

227
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,850
And finally, we have our
post-quantum cryptography team

228
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,830
and quantum networking team

229
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,783
that's part of AWS Core Networking.

230
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,160
So let's start with a brief overview.

231
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,440
So the AWS Center for Quantum Computing,

232
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,840
already mentioned, is
an AWS research center

233
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
that's located at Caltech.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,480
We are building our own quantum
computing hardware there

235
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,960
with a quantum error
correction first approach.

236
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,420
So we really want to address
that next level of scaling

237
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,270
that is required to take the technology

238
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,140
from studying the hammer
to using the hammer.

239
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,140
We're building on a technology
that is dubbed Cat Qubits,

240
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,300
which combines superconducting
qubits with resonators,

241
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,640
microwave resonators, to
suppress certain types of noise.

242
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,750
And I'll talk a little bit more

243
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,730
about that on the next slide.

244
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,700
As a matter of fact, just
beginning of the year,

245
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,510
we showed and published results
from our first prototype

246
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,160
that's called Ocelot.

247
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,473
There's a picture of the chip here.

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,670
And we were able to show that
through that architecture,

249
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,990
this Cat-Qubit architecture,

250
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,870
we are able to suppress
a certain type of noise

251
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,640
to a degree where the resources required

252
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,700
to implement error correction
on this architecture

253
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,320
is 10 times lower than in
the traditional approach.

254
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,970
So we're very excited about these results.

255
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,690
But of course, our approach
is only one of many, right?

256
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,520
There are many other promising directions

257
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,220
from building quantum computers with ions

258
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,810
that are trapped,
building quantum computers

259
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,370
with neutral Rydberg atoms
or photons and many others.

260
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,290
And at the same time, we
believe that we need to bring

261
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,510
this technology in the
hands of our customers

262
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,360
so that they can experiment
with this technology,

263
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,920
start developing algorithms,

264
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,660
and start developing the IP around

265
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,520
how we can bring the new applications

266
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,380
and the resource requirements
of them further down.

267
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,820
And that was the reason for us

268
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,200
why we launched Amazon Bracket
in 2020 at this point, right?

269
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,780
We wanted to democratize
quantum computing,

270
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,670
bring different types of quantum computers

271
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,780
in the hands of our customers

272
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,180
so that they can learn, experiment,

273
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,400
but also do research into applications

274
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,100
and envision how quantum
computers will be used

275
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,900
in the context of AWS,

276
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,543
in the context of existing HPC pipelines.

277
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,170
And today, we provide access to

278
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,610
third-party quantum computers

279
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,990
and in the future also, of course,

280
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,530
our own AWS-built quantum
computers in the fullness of time,

281
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,353
all in one consistent experience.

282
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,780
The quantum computers that
we have available today

283
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,120
is from five different providers.

284
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,280
That is two ion trap providers,

285
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,413
IonQ and Alpine Quantum Technology, AQT.

286
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,500
We have two providers that are building

287
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,280
superconducting QPUs with Rigetti and IQM.

288
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,600
And finally, we have a provider

289
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,600
that is building Rydberg-based
quantum computers from QuEra.

290
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,910
So we wanna give customers that choice

291
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,500
and the ability to contrast

292
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,970
and compare the different approaches.

293
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,060
Each of them have different
pros, different cons.

294
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,630
It is not clear that this
is a winner-take-all market

295
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,770
by any means, right?

296
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,860
There is a lot of different
potential applications

297
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,940
for each of these technologies

298
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,010
because they have all very
different characteristics

299
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,023
and different programming paradigms.

300
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
And we wanna give customers

301
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,853
that visibility into the technology.

302
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,130
So then, let's take a
look at a 20,000-foot view

303
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,640
to Amazon Bracket.

304
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,940
And we think about Bracket

305
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,260
in kind of three different layers, right?

306
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,660
Like at the bottom, you
have the infrastructure

307
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,493
and the access modes, right?

308
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:03,840
So we are providing access to QPUs,

309
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,000
to quantum circuit simulators,

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,860
as well as to the classical compute

311
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,530
that is used with quantum
computers in tandem.

312
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,440
We're gonna hear about
that more from Michael.

313
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,260
And we can access these quantum computers

314
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,340
in different access mode.

315
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,870
For example, on-demand,

316
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,030
just pay-as-you-go as you used from AWS.

317
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,590
You can also make reservations

318
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,650
where you get dedicated
time on a particular device

319
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,650
where only you can access it
at the time that suits you.

320
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
In the middle part of the stack,

321
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,740
we're providing the interfaces
and capabilities, right?

322
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,740
From Jupyter IDEs to
programming tools and compilers

323
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,870
and a feature for executing
quantum hybrid algorithms

324
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,100
with hybrid jobs.

325
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,560
And then finally, at the top of the layer,

326
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,100
we want to bring different type
of tooling to our customers

327
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,410
that they are used to
and want to use, right?

328
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,170
We are supporting all of the major

329
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,350
quantum computing frameworks
from IBM's Qiskit to Penny Lane

330
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,143
and NVIDIA's CUDA Quantum, CUDA Q,

331
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,210
as well as a whole list
of software tooling

332
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,090
and programming frameworks
from our partners.

333
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,830
Many of them are here at re:Invent today

334
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,630
and giving their presentations.

335
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,610
I encourage everybody to check that out.

336
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,320
But essentially, we're realizing

337
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,850
we can't build it all on our own.

338
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,640
And we want to make sure
that anything runs on bracket

339
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,400
and we bring the tooling to our customers

340
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,500
that they want to use.

341
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,420
And throughout that stack,

342
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,540
we are trying constantly
to improve the performance,

343
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,940
make the user experience better,

344
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,030
get more throughput performance
and quality performance

345
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,880
out of these early stage devices.

346
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,230
And there's a lot we could talk about

347
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,320
with the different capabilities.

348
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I picked out a feature that
we just recently launched.

349
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,500
This is Amazon Bracket Program Sets.

350
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,330
So the idea here is that

351
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,160
the way you interact
with a quantum computer

352
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,780
is not that you send a single program

353
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,310
and you get it back and you analyze it.

354
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,560
In reality, a very common workload pattern

355
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,210
is that you send multiple
of these programs

356
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,330
that either are related to each
other, they can be the same,

357
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,610
they can be somehow connected

358
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,920
or also completely independent.

359
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,600
And for each and every
program that you send,

360
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,180
you need to compile it, you
need to have the I/O overhead

361
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,850
of bringing it down to the
control system of the QPU,

362
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,190
load it onto the FPGA
and so on and so forth.

363
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,890
So there is overhead
in each of those steps.

364
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,900
And with Program Sets,
we're allowing customers,

365
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,890
we're enabling customers

366
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,320
to submit multiple quantum programs,

367
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,910
a whole series of quantum programs

368
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,430
in a single payload
with a single API call,

369
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,210
which allows us to optimize that payload,

370
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,540
compile it and gain efficiencies
through compilations

371
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,060
and I/O process, bringing
multiple programs

372
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,160
at the same time onto the FPGA.

373
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,230
And for certain types of workloads,

374
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,373
we're seeing up to 24x
speedups with this feature.

375
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,240
So with that, I wanna come back

376
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,030
to this kind of inverted
pyramid of use cases.

377
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,680
And as we discussed before,

378
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,780
we think that the first use cases

379
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,610
will be in the scientific domain

380
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,560
before we go into broad industry adoption.

381
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,400
And I don't wanna downplay
this as a mere stepping stone

382
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,640
because I think it's a very
profound fact, actually,

383
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,430
that quantum computers will change the way

384
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,080
that we understand nature,

385
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,020
that we can understand how nature behaves

386
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,463
at the microscopic level.

387
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,900
And in fact, a recent study from NERSC,

388
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,700
this is a supercomputing facility

389
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,203
from the Department of Energy,

390
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,510
found that at least 50% of
their production workload

391
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,450
has the potential to be
exponentially accelerated

392
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,863
by quantum computers.

393
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,450
So there's a tremendous opportunity

394
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,810
to accelerate research and scientific work

395
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,853
through quantum computing directly.

396
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,440
And many countries and
governments around the world

397
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,150
are realizing this opportunity.

398
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,680
So this was one study from NERSC.

399
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,630
Other studies, for example, from LANL

400
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,520
find numbers between 30 and 50%.

401
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
But countries around the world realizing

402
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
that this is an opportunity

403
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,160
to accelerate scientific breakthroughs

404
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,580
and have founded national
quantum initiatives

405
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,160
to find those first use cases

406
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,930
and then also use it as a stepping stone

407
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,390
for further industry adoptions.

408
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,910
And a number of those
government initiatives,

409
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,410
national initiatives,

410
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,510
they're building with
Amazon Bracket, right?

411
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,690
Because the first thing
that they want to have

412
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,570
is to give access to quantum computers

413
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,153
to their local research communities.

414
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,160
With Amazon Bracket, they
get access to HPC resources

415
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,050
and quantum computers on demand.

416
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,280
We build scalable and
secure research environments

417
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,190
as well as a tailored
administrative and budget controls

418
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,790
to run large-scale research
organizations in the cloud.

419
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,030
For example, we're working
with the NQCH in Singapore,

420
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,030
with the NQCC in the
UK, QCloud in Ireland,

421
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,280
and POSI in Australia.

422
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,680
As a matter of fact, we just launched,

423
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,740
POSI just launched the quantum hub portal

424
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,920
which provides researchers
access to quantum computing

425
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,710
and classical computing
resources through AWS

426
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,840
with tailored administrative controls.

427
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,580
And they're now starting
to run the Zettonics QPilot

428
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,910
where they will allocate
quantum computing resources

429
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,210
for local researchers to drive
that innovation flywheel.

430
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,940
And we're super excited
about initiatives like this

431
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,640
because we think there's a
lot of research to be done

432
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,940
and by having access to
real quantum computers,

433
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,133
that research can accelerate.

434
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,460
So, but of course, we are all very excited

435
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,970
about bringing that technology
also out of academia

436
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,790
into broad industry adoption

437
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,840
and Michael is gonna tell
us more about that idea

438
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,690
and how we're going to drive
our customer engagement

439
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,280
in this field.

440
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Take it away, Michael.
- Thank you.

441
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,970
Well, thanks very much, Eric.

442
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,143
Wonderful introduction
to Bracket as a service.

443
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:17,940
(audience applauds)

444
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,400
So Eric and I work very closely together.

445
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,710
He builds and operates
the Bracket service.

446
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,150
He makes it available to our customers

447
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,090
so that he can use it
through the AWS console.

448
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,610
It's a service that's available
in the cloud for you today.

449
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,350
You can access quantum computers

450
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,020
just in the way that you would
any other service on AWS.

451
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,590
So if you enjoy using EC2,
you're gonna love using Bracket

452
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,940
'cause it's just another service

453
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,920
but we've got quantum computers on there.

454
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,740
My job is to talk to
our enterprise customers

455
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,690
about where quantum computing is headed

456
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,840
and how they will be able to
make use of this in the future,

457
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,360
the kind of workloads that
they'll be interested in,

458
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,070
the thinking that they
need to go through now

459
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,930
to prepare their strategies

460
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,090
for quantum computing in the future.

461
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,570
Most of our customers today
on Bracket are researchers,

462
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,620
as Eric mentioned.

463
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,900
They're national labs, they're hubs,

464
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,450
they are individual
researchers at universities.

465
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,460
Most of them are doing science.

466
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,340
So they come to AWS to
use the infrastructure

467
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,620
that we've got available
to do good science.

468
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,320
So they're collecting data,
they're doing physics research,

469
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,730
they're doing computer science research,

470
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,430
they're doing application and
benchmarking style research.

471
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,530
But as we build up this stack,

472
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,400
we move from the science
to looking more at

473
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,160
solving industrial scientific use cases.

474
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,560
So we'll give an example in a
moment about drug discovery,

475
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,730
but also think about materials design,

476
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,420
think about production opportunities.

477
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,620
But at the big scale and
where we wanna get to

478
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,390
is how do we use quantum computers

479
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,570
for large-scale enterprise problems

480
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,710
in exactly the same way that we use

481
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,373
high-performance compute
classically today at AWS.

482
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,660
So some companies are
really starting to invest

483
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,920
in this ahead of the curve.

484
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,510
There are a few leaders out there

485
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,910
that are really investing
in quantum computing

486
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,040
in understanding those use cases

487
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,120
and where the potential might be.

488
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,700
One of those companies is JPMorgan Chase.

489
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,920
We actually have another
breakout session tomorrow,

490
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,980
which I encourage you to
come to, with JPMorgan Chase,

491
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,470
where we will go through
exactly how we operate

492
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,670
the end-to-end application
study and benchmarking work

493
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,210
that we've been doing with
them for the past year.

494
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,250
But their motivation is really clear.

495
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,170
Marco Pistoia, who until very recently

496
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,590
led the quantum computing
program at JPMorgan.

497
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,990
He's since gone on to a
wonderful new opportunity

498
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,090
at a quantum computing hardware company.

499
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,347
But he said, "If a company
doesn't do anything

500
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:42,877
"about the market right now,

501
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:46,650
"when quantum advantage becomes
real, it might be too late."

502
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,840
And this is really important.

503
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,690
This is a fast-moving technology.

504
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,340
This is not just a lift and shift

505
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,670
from an existing HPC workload
to a quantum compute workload.

506
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,380
These are complex algorithms.

507
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,880
They're complex problems.

508
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,340
They take some thinking to work through

509
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,650
to design new approaches

510
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,590
to running quantum classical hybrid work,

511
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,150
to running workflows together.

512
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,270
And so the leading organizations

513
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,450
in enterprise adoption of quantum compute

514
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,830
are really thinking about this now

515
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,430
in anticipation of that
future potential advantage.

516
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,250
So here's the journey that we
go through with them on it.

517
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,760
We look at, through a discovery
process around use cases,

518
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,280
helping them identify
the kinds of workloads

519
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,650
that are well-suited
to a quantum computer.

520
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,530
We then research and benchmark with them

521
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,390
the quantum computing algorithms.

522
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,160
So we compare quantum on quantum.

523
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,830
How does one quantum
computing hardware system

524
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,140
compare to another quantum
computing hardware system?

525
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,420
We also compare quantum
and classical together.

526
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,610
So how does the best
available classical approach

527
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,470
to that problem match

528
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,090
with the quantum computing
approach to that?

529
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,800
And then look at the hybrid opportunities.

530
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,050
What if we combine
different things together

531
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,600
and orchestrate across
multiple different platforms

532
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,030
on AWS to explore this space?

533
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,100
And that's what pushing the
boundaries is all about.

534
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,360
How do we unlock the potential
of end-to-end compute,

535
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,830
so using a quantum computer

536
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,210
to make classical computers go faster?

537
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,410
And then that will lay
the groundwork for us

538
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,780
for production applications in the future.

539
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,150
So bringing all this together,

540
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,100
we want our customers to be prepared

541
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,850
so that as soon as Amazon
Bracket gets bigger

542
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,110
and we've got more capacity

543
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,690
and we're scaling up
across multiple regions,

544
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,310
you are ready with your workloads

545
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,693
to jump straight into that.

546
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,380
So last year at reInvent,

547
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,080
we launched a program
called Quantum Embark.

548
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,210
Quantum Embark is our sort of entry point

549
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,040
for any enterprise customers

550
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,020
to just get started
with quantum computing.

551
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,880
So if you're not quite sure what to do,

552
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
you know you should do something,

553
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,940
but you're not sure what
that something should be,

554
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,210
this is the program for you.

555
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,030
So it is a 12-week,
fixed-price, fixed-scope program

556
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,090
to just get started in quantum computing

557
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,780
and work with our teams to
work through that process

558
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,400
that I just described on the last slide.

559
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,260
So the use case discovery,

560
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,420
do some training and enablement together,

561
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,460
and then deep dive on
one particular problem.

562
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,950
So let's pick one problem
from your organization

563
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,390
and solve it together.

564
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,470
Go through the process

565
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,660
to write out the quantum
computing algorithms,

566
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,760
compare it to the classical algorithms,

567
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,800
fit it onto a quantum computer on Bracket,

568
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,120
benchmark it quantum to
classical and quantum to quantum.

569
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,760
That process takes about 12 weeks.

570
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,350
We work as a joint team together,

571
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,420
so some of our solution architects

572
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,940
and applied science specialists
around quantum computing,

573
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,330
some of your team as well,
and we bring that together.

574
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,550
The whole idea is that
we're able to give you

575
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,040
and your executive teams
actionable outcomes

576
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,270
without the hype.

577
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,040
There's a lot of hype and excitement,

578
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,830
and for good reason,
around quantum computing,

579
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,650
but how do we make it real for
your particular organization

580
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,050
and so the Quantum Embark
program is all about that,

581
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,490
giving you some actionable outcomes

582
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,950
so that you can understand
if and when quantum computing

583
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,870
is gonna have an impact on your business,

584
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,310
and then you can start to inform

585
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,950
the rest of the stakeholders
across your company

586
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,463
about where that's headed.

587
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,600
A little bit deeper, we've got a team

588
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,090
called the Advanced Solutions Lab.

589
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,740
This is our professional services team

590
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,810
that engages directly with customers

591
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,100
to do long-term R&D engagements
around quantum computing.

592
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,350
Our colleague Martin Schutz
from the Advanced Solutions Lab

593
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,690
will be on stage tomorrow
at the breakout session

594
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,150
I was mentioning with JP Morgan Chase

595
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,140
to talk about exactly this.

596
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,250
They had a three-year program of effort

597
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,170
looking at multiple problems
across quantum computing

598
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,930
at every level, so from optimization

599
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,790
of how to use particular devices

600
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,210
to compilation strategies
to application benchmarking.

601
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,880
This is a deep research team.

602
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
This team will design
a custom R&D engagement

603
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,350
for your particular needs.

604
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,790
They'll work with you to develop

605
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,000
and explore novel quantum
computing algorithms.

606
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,610
We'll look at opportunities to
deliver business value today

607
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,530
on classical compute hardware,

608
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,050
but most importantly, generate
that intellectual property

609
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,770
so that you've got the know-how and the IP

610
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,590
so that you can take
advantage of quantum computing

611
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,373
as it matures over time.

612
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,740
Practically now, let's take a look at

613
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,060
what does quantum computing mean

614
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,910
for our entire accelerated
compute portfolio.

615
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,730
So if you are a user of AWS's

616
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,280
high-performance compute services,

617
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,900
where does quantum computing fit

618
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,300
into that overall landscape?

619
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,990
And the good news is that in some ways,

620
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,310
bracket and quantum computing

621
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,300
is just another instance
of compute on AWS.

622
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,880
It's just another type
of accelerated computing.

623
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,690
So we have CPUs, GPUs,
other accelerated processes

624
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,610
like Trainium and Inferentia.

625
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,630
Well, quantum computing is
just one more type of computer

626
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,230
in that overall portfolio.

627
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,500
And so we've been doing
a lot of work this year

628
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,730
to integrate bracket as
another sort of instance type

629
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,250
within the high-performance
compute services of AWS.

630
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,610
So you might be familiar with
the Parallel Compute Service,

631
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,070
with AWS Batch, with Parallel Cluster.

632
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,470
This is for classical HPC.

633
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,590
So if you're the Formula
One, if you're Ferrari,

634
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,550
and you need to do
computational fluid dynamics,

635
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,730
those are the services that you're using

636
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,730
to do those large industrial-scale

637
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,580
heavy compute workloads on AWS.

638
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,340
They don't go directly to
EC2 to spin up instances.

639
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,790
They use these orchestration tools

640
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,210
to do those large-scale problems.

641
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,460
And so we're looking at
how do we integrate bracket

642
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,720
directly into that?

643
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,820
You should be able to go straight

644
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,920
to the high-performance compute services

645
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,910
and spin up accelerated compute instances

646
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,280
of multiple different types
that include quantum computing

647
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,080
and orchestrate across that entire

648
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,880
end-to-end workflow over time.

649
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
So we've been doing a lot of work

650
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,730
to integrate that into the systems,

651
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,460
and the example that I'm
gonna show you in a second

652
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,040
is based on exactly that framework.

653
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,880
So think about AWS as
the core infrastructure.

654
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,210
We've got compute and
networking and storage.

655
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,853
Bracket is just another
form of compute on there.

656
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,990
Different abilities to consume
that compute over time.

657
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,840
So on our classical infrastructure,

658
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,730
we've got on-demand,
we've got capacity blocks,

659
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,593
we do spot, reserve instances.

660
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,080
We're building out exactly the same

661
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,090
for bracket over time as well.

662
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,250
So right now, you can
log into the console,

663
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,380
you can access bracket on-demand,

664
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,490
you only pay for what you use,

665
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,590
no upfront commitment to
use a quantum computer,

666
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,230
or you can reserve a
capacity block next Tuesday

667
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,960
at 3 p.m. to do your
particular workload as well.

668
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,970
So we really are thinking
about quantum computing

669
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,550
as just another computer
within the framework

670
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,250
that you're already used to running

671
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,723
large-scale workloads on AWS.

672
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,140
So let's take a look at what a large-scale

673
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,080
end-to-end industrial
strength workflow looks like.

674
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,540
So this is a very typical kind of workflow

675
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,060
for one of our high-performance
compute customers.

676
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,590
They might be doing drug discovery,

677
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,960
computational fluid dynamics,

678
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,300
some kind of engineering analysis,

679
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,280
circuit layout, something like that.

680
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,570
And there'll be some user
action process right at the top

681
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,790
that will flow down to an execution plan,

682
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,380
there'll be some I/O on there,

683
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,600
there'll be an orchestration layer

684
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,120
handling different types of compute,

685
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,880
but all of this numerical
heavy lifting that's going on.

686
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,350
That could be a couple of hours of work,

687
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,430
couple of weeks of work,

688
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,290
couple of months of work that's going on.

689
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,740
We see everything in between.

690
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,620
And the idea of quantum computing is,

691
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,480
well, what if we could interleave

692
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,910
some parts of that overall workflow

693
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,580
that are well-suited to a quantum computer

694
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,770
so we're still doing quantum
and classical together,

695
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,303
but in a hybrid modality?

696
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,330
Can we get an end-to-end speedup?

697
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,380
Can we reduce the entire
operational end-to-end workflow

698
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,140
of a large-scale
high-performance compute workload

699
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,470
and get a faster result for our customers

700
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,263
and hopefully a lower cost
result for our customers as well?

701
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,140
So we're at the very early stages

702
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,790
of putting this into practice.

703
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:58,260
And we've got a great example
with our customer AstraZeneca

704
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,690
that we worked with earlier this year

705
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,150
to explore exactly this kind of problem.

706
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,750
And so this was a joint
program that we did together

707
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,780
between AstraZeneca, IonQ,

708
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,500
the quantum computing hardware
company that's on bracket,

709
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,940
NVIDIA, and AWS.

710
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,730
So it was the four
companies working together,

711
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,850
looking at the algorithm problems,

712
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,610
the orchestration problems,

713
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,410
how we bring that back together
as an end-to-end workflow

714
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,510
and to see what kind of
result we could get there.

715
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,420
And so the particular problem
that we were looking at

716
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,340
was this chemistry problem

717
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,430
called transition metal catalysis.

718
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,830
And it underpins so much of what happens

719
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,990
in modern drug design.

720
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,270
This is part of the everyday workflow

721
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,640
that every drug company
in the world goes through.

722
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,470
And it's a really tough
computational problem to solve.

723
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,110
It is very difficult
for a classical computer

724
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,570
to simulate this because as the complexity

725
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,370
of these molecules grows,

726
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,020
the amount of connections between them

727
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,520
also increases exponentially

728
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,920
and it becomes harder and
harder to simulate that.

729
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,810
But if we could simulate
these accurately and early,

730
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,860
then we could identify
new synthesis routes

731
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,300
before going to the wet lab,

732
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,940
before doing that work,
mixing chemicals together

733
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,190
to see what would actually happen.

734
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,470
And so the particular chemistry problem

735
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,510
that we looked at here
was something called

736
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,840
the oxidative addition and
Suzuki-Miyaura coupling,

737
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,960
the nickel catalyst, really
rolls off the tongue.

738
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,560
But the idea here is that

739
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,150
we're looking at a catalytic process.

740
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,350
So we're going from that
B state up to the BC state

741
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,610
and then down to the C.

742
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,430
And so that's an energy barrier
that we need to get over.

743
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,640
So we're modeling out what
happens in the real world

744
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,810
in real chemistry, quantum
mechanical process,

745
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,810
going over this energy barrier
through a catalytic state.

746
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,400
And that determines whether
the height of that barrier

747
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,470
determines whether this
reaction is going to run at all.

748
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,020
So if it's too high, if
it's too much of a barrier,

749
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,490
when we go into the wet lab,

750
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,750
that's not going to come together

751
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,130
as the molecule that we want.

752
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,770
So we wanna understand
before we go to the lab,

753
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,000
the height of that barrier

754
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,900
and what the end state is going to be.

755
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,853
Solving that problem is
really, really tough.

756
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,240
This is the classical workflow for it.

757
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,530
So we start with
calculating an active space

758
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,160
and then there's something
called the trial wave function,

759
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,610
which is one of the hardest
parts of this overall state.

760
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,570
This is where the quantum bonds

761
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,930
are being understood by the computers.

762
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,910
And then we hand it off
to classical systems

763
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,260
to run some Monte Carlo analysis

764
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,250
and find the overall energy
state at the end of that.

765
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,590
But it turns out that we can replace

766
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,630
one part of this workflow

767
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,510
with a quantum computing
algorithm instead.

768
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,010
And so working together,
AstraZeneca, NVIDIA, IonQ and AWS,

769
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,490
we said, what if we went
classical, quantum, classical?

770
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,490
We put a whole bunch of, we
adapt the classical algorithm

771
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,810
to better suit a quantum computer

772
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,060
and then we also adapt
the classical workload

773
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,260
that happens afterwards.

774
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,633
Can we get a better result
from that over time?

775
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,290
So we took a look at adapting

776
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,930
that trial wave state function preparation

777
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,090
on the IonQ Forte-1 machine.

778
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:21,923
At the time that we ran this,

779
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:26,040
this was the latest device
that we had on bracket.

780
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,400
And we ran what we think
was the largest scale

781
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,110
quantum compute workload
that's ever been run

782
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,820
on these systems.

783
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,340
And so it was fitting those
molecules that we saw before

784
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,380
through that energy state transition

785
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,290
onto the quantum computer

786
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,870
and doing a whole bunch
of sampling around that.

787
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,100
We then moved those results over

788
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,600
to classical post-processing
using AWS Parallel Cluster,

789
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,450
one of our high-performance
compute services.

790
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,910
And we ran the Monte Carlo simulations

791
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,000
to find the final energy state there.

792
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,620
We used a lot of compute to do this.

793
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,860
We used 40 P5 EN instances.

794
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,590
Those are the H100 instances from NVIDIA

795
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,300
for a couple of days
running compute on here.

796
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,280
So it was a big workload.

797
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,660
The end-to-end state here,

798
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,820
we think, is the largest
end-to-end workload

799
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,090
that's ever been run quantum
and classical together.

800
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,943
And the results are
really, really promising.

801
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,490
What this chart is showing,

802
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,740
on the x-axis is the system size,

803
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,390
essentially the size of the molecules,

804
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,730
the size of the atoms
that we're looking at.

805
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,100
So bigger and bigger molecules

806
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,070
as we go out to the right-hand side.

807
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,010
And on the y-axis is the runtime
in seconds on a log scale.

808
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,530
So more processing time to get there.

809
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,483
The dashed lines that you see

810
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:43,290
were the previous best
available classical results

811
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,940
that we had from this.

812
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,120
So as these molecules got bigger,

813
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,270
the previous best classical systems

814
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,710
were in those dashed lines there.

815
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,830
The solid line is what we're
able to produce classically

816
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,160
on this hybrid workflow.

817
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,800
So the particular solid dot
that's in the middle there

818
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,200
is this particular result,
so right in the middle.

819
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,250
So that gap between the
solid dot on the solid line

820
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,130
and the lowest level of the dashed line,

821
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,530
that is the performance increase

822
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,690
that we're able to get
between these two workloads.

823
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,090
And that is a 656 times speedup

824
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,450
over that part of the processing cycle

825
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,770
that we went through there.

826
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,670
So a really significant result.

827
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,150
Now, this isn't something that
we could put in production.

828
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,850
When we had to play a lot
of tricks on our system

829
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,340
to make this work, we had to learn a lot

830
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,340
about the orchestration of
running a hybrid workload on AWS.

831
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,480
And it took a lot of compute to do this.

832
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,730
So we can't run this in
production every day.

833
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,580
Also, we weren't looking
at the cost around it.

834
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,500
But it gives us a lot of confidence

835
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,570
that as we're building out these systems,

836
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,710
as we get bigger and bigger,

837
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,360
as we're able to do more and more

838
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,160
sophisticated orchestration
across high-performance compute,

839
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,590
that as these molecules get bigger,

840
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,560
we're going to see a
huge performance increase

841
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,600
that we're gonna be able to
deliver to customers there.

842
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,350
So as we extrapolate out
to molecules like FeMoCo

843
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,480
that are really important to problems

844
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,630
in industrial processing
and nitrogen fixation,

845
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,280
and hopefully, eventually,

846
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,320
things like fertilizer production,

847
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,120
that we're going to be
able to model these systems

848
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,520
in a really interesting way.

849
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,410
So I just wanna remind
everyone of something

850
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,200
that Eric said right at the
top of the presentation,

851
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,510
that no quantum computer today

852
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,130
can solve an industry-relevant problem

853
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,530
faster, cheaper, or more accurately

854
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,450
than the best available
classical alternative.

855
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,830
That is still true.

856
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,450
The example that I showed you before

857
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,300
does not yet meet these criteria.

858
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,240
But it's a stepping stone to that.

859
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,000
We can really see and
have a lot of confidence

860
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,410
around where this is headed.

861
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,560
As these computers get bigger,
as they get more capable,

862
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,300
we are gonna be able to
tick off these things,

863
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,280
to be able to go faster,
to be able to go cheaper,

864
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,530
to be able to do things more accurately

865
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,510
than the best available
classical alternative,

866
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,160
and be able to do it in
production over time as well.

867
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,850
So what can you do today?

868
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,860
How do you take action around this?

869
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,930
Well, this is what the
leading companies are doing.

870
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,100
They're generating IP.

871
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,900
They're generating the algorithms

872
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,270
that will run on these quantum computers.

873
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,740
They're generating the know-how

874
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,930
about how to operate it in the cloud.

875
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,040
And so you can do that too.

876
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,810
You can get engaged with us
or with our partner network

877
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,150
and explore what the
intellectual property portfolio

878
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,040
looks like that will have an impact

879
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,590
on your compute solutions.

880
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,210
You can engage the supply chain.

881
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,050
You're understanding

882
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,370
the quantum computing hardware companies,

883
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,780
understanding the software libraries,

884
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,480
the open source community, the
partners that are out there,

885
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,030
the university researchers
that are engaged in this.

886
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,710
You're having a deep understanding

887
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,380
of where your compute is gonna come from,

888
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,970
where your algorithms are gonna come from,

889
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,630
where your software
library is gonna come from.

890
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,730
It's an important part of the puzzle.

891
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,000
And then finally, build a workforce.

892
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,850
Have a few people within your organization

893
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,370
who can understand this technology,

894
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,160
who can make sense of it for
your particular organization,

895
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,440
who can start to read the news

896
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,750
and be able to process it in
a way that's relevant to you

897
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,610
and be able to react quickly

898
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,420
as computers get more and
more capable over time.

899
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,520
And so we're here to help you do that.

900
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,500
We've got a lot of options available

901
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,130
for you to engage with us
at AWS on quantum compute.

902
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,050
In the middle is Bracket.

903
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,460
This is an operational service

904
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,160
in general availability on AWS today.

905
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,960
We've been running this for five years.

906
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,520
You can access quantum computers

907
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,620
in the cloud this afternoon if you'd like.

908
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,220
We actually have a series
of workshops this week

909
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,830
so you can get hands-on
with quantum computing

910
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,993
in one of our workshops through
the rest of these sessions.

911
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,750
Couple of other options.

912
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,330
We've got a digital badge
available on AWS Skill Builder.

913
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,830
You can work through a course,

914
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,990
get a digital badge through that.

915
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,640
Quantum Embark we talked about before

916
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,760
for enterprise customers to
engage in quantum computing.

917
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,300
The Advanced Solutions Lab if
you wanna do a deeper project.

918
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,430
And then Amazon Bracket
Direct is our program

919
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,990
so that you can work directly

920
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,940
with our hardware supplies as well.

921
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,800
So if you wanna engage
on a particular problem

922
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,000
with IonQ or Regetti
or AQT or QuEra or IQM,

923
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,220
you can do it through that program.

924
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,320
So a lot of different ways to engage.

925
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,840
And then finally, just to wrap up,

926
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,870
we've got a lot of sessions
on quantum compute this week.

927
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,150
This is just a selection.

928
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,040
All of the sessions that
we've got on quantum computer

929
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,140
through the QR code there.

930
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,370
But I've just put a
selection on the slide here

931
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,280
so that if you wanna follow up on this

932
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,870
and go a little bit deeper,

933
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,370
please come to the
breakout session tomorrow

934
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,400
with JPMorgan Chase and
look at the applications

935
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,810
in the financial sector.

936
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,660
We've got some chalk talks
that go into hybrid compute,

937
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,400
into how we're using generative AI

938
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,610
to accelerate quantum
computing software development.

939
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,490
And then finally, a little bit more hubs,

940
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,320
which is what Eric was
talking about before

941
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,550
with those national
compute resource centers

942
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,700
and how we're integrating in with them.

943
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,730
So we're delighted that
you can make it along today

944
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,560
to this session to learn a little bit more

945
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,410
about what we're doing in
quantum technologies at AWS.

946
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,830
And we hope to see you
on Bracket in the future.

947
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,830
Thank you very much.
