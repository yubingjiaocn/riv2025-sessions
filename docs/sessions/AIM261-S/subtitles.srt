1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,539
I think folks, we're gonna go ahead and get started. Uh,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,448
hi, everyone. Um, thank you all for attending the talks

3
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,509
today. My name's Corey Dobson. Uh, I'm a

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,569
solution engineering lead here at Poolside.

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,470
Uh, today I'm gonna be joined by Ivo, uh, principal,

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,210
uh, principal from our solutions architecture

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,289
team, and, uh, Praveen, a senior

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,329
engineer, uh, from Northrop Grumman Space

9
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,829
Systems, an organization who actually deployed Poolside,

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,329
uh, securely in their organization.

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,138
Uh, I want to thank AWS for the opportunity to

12
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:28,298
speak today and for you all wrapping up, uh,

13
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,739
you know, the final day of the conference, spending the afternoon with us.

14
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,319
Uh, it's, it's really been great.

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,020
Uh, as this session is titled, uh, Poolside

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,000
AI Models for highly secure software

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,679
Environments, uh, we want to present today a high-level

18
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,978
overview of our product stack and

19
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:44,039
how it's unique for software teams either in,

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,279
uh, those highly controlled or,

21
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,859
um, air gapped, uh, scenarios.

22
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,329
Uh, and kind of an overview of our deployment

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,228
structure, what that looks like on AWS as well.

24
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:56,109
Uh, poolside's models are built for various types of users.

25
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,649
Uh, however, software is, is really a bread and butter

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,908
kind of use case for us. So

27
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,579
we're gonna also show some demos of this stack

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,880
working within the SDLC,

29
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,388
uh, and hear how

30
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,168
software folks like Praveen,

31
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,930
uh, at, at Northrop are using Poolside

32
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,180
today. Uh, if you like what you hear in the presentation,

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,500
we do have a booth in the expo hall. I know the expo's,

34
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:16,469
uh, closing soon, but it's a booth number,

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,540
um, 802. It's right, uh, big parasol

36
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,808
booth when you walk in. So

37
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,189
some of, some folks are head nodding, you might have visited the booth

38
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,528
and grabbed some poolside swag

39
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,459
throughout the week, but maybe after this session,

40
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:28,230
hop over there and,

41
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,838
uh, come and visit us, especially if you think poolside

42
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:33,159
might be able to help out, uh, your organization and your software

43
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,299
teams. Uh, so let's get, let's get started.

44
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:38,290
Uh, what is Poolside? Well, Poolside is a frontier

45
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,480
model lab building secure enterprise

46
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,290
AI systems,

47
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,629
uh, deployed anywhere.

48
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:45,909
Uh, we're a US based company, founded in 2023,

49
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,290
and we build both AI models and

50
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,370
the agent orchestration platform that powers

51
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,430
them, uh, completely from scratch, uh,

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,558
designed to run entirely within your own infrastructure.

53
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,629
Uh, AI has definitely reshaped how

54
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,969
even the most, you know, secure mission critical

55
00:01:58,969 --> 00:01:59,750
work gets done.

56
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,129
Uh, and our aim at Poolside is to, uh, be

57
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,329
that, be that mission, uh, mission critical

58
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,338
platform. Uh, we power

59
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:08,808
teams with our complete AI infrastructure stack,

60
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,199
uh, and some expert research engineers to help

61
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,599
design their AI workloads.

62
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,099
Uh, we've read about far too many, uh, POCs

63
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,419
that never make it, uh, into the production

64
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,139
stage. They stay AI POCs,

65
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,538
um, either due to some data that needs

66
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,939
to, uh, stay within the network that unfortunately

67
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,679
has to keep getting passed out.

68
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:28,288
Uh, or teams just not being able to confidently deploy

69
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:29,580
AI agents at scale,

70
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,008
uh, within their infrastructure. So we solved this

71
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:34,409
with both the software stack, uh, and

72
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,629
research experts, um,

73
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:36,990
to embed with your team.

74
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,868
So let's dig into that software stack to start,

75
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:42,210
uh, and learn about what we mean when we say

76
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,528
complete AI infrastructure.

77
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,849
Uh, to start, it begins, uh, with the poolside

78
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,979
Foundational models. Uh, poolside models are trained

79
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,460
with internet scale data, and they're combined, combined

80
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,580
with some proprietary, uh, synthetic data sets

81
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,699
we have. Um, our colleague at Poolside, Joe

82
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,740
Roll, uh, did an excellent job earlier

83
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,939
today, uh, breaking this down in a previous talk.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,179
Uh, so if you're interested in how we actually do

85
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,618
pre-training and post. Training of these AI models,

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,919
uh, and what we call our model factory, our model

87
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,919
building process, uh, I'd recommend checking out

88
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,038
the recording of that talk, uh, or

89
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,199
checking out our blog on our page, our

90
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,558
website, um, page called the Model Factory.

91
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,278
Uh, it's, it's quite a deep dive into this virtualization

92
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:20,319
environment, but it's what we scaled, uh, for

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
our applied research team, uh, to be able

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,360
to, to scale up model checkpoints and be able

95
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,338
to essentially build this, this piece here of our stack.

96
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,058
Uh, it's worth noting that this, uh, poolside model,

97
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,629
uh, uh, piece is, um,

98
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,050
not based on an open source model. It's not just

99
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,649
say, say it's

100
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,788
an open source model and then fine-tuned, but rather,

101
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,490
uh, our model that we run pre-training and post-training

102
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,909
on. Uh, and we have some novel techniques

103
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,919
built around reinforcement learning, which allow us to

104
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,899
create some high quality synthetic data sets,

105
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,000
uh, for future model training too. Uh,

106
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:51,308
so Poolside doesn't require nor, nor do

107
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:52,899
we want, uh, any of your data

108
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:54,538
for model training. Um,

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,020
when you use Poolside, no data comes back

110
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,159
to us to train the model. That's a, that's a core philosophy

111
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,189
of us. Uh, it's truly, you know,

112
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,469
your own model that you have on-prem. When you deploy

113
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:05,778
poolside, you get the model and all of the weights.

114
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,349
Uh, so, um, it's, it's

115
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,389
really the, the complete, complete stack here,

116
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,849
and it starts with, it starts with the models.

117
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,409
Uh, it leads us to the next piece, which is connecting

118
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,410
it to your organization's data and making it

119
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,329
relevant for your team.

120
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,290
Uh, since poolside's deployed entirely in your boundary,

121
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,988
uh, it can, it can be connected to any data source,

122
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,129
uh, securely because essentially we come

123
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:27,170
to where the data is. We don't ask

124
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,209
your data to come to us, but rather we bring

125
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,329
the stack to you. And this allows Poolside

126
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,819
to securely access context from knowledge bases

127
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,738
or runtime,

128
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,879
uh, data sources that you normally wouldn't

129
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,379
want to pass outside of your network. Well, you can, you

130
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,809
can pass those securely to Poolside without compromising

131
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,939
any of your intellectual property. So, unlike,

132
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,139
you know, maybe other AI models that send your

133
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,178
data outside of the network and and or into some

134
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:48,959
sort of data mode,

135
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,439
um, Poolside brings, you know, the stack,

136
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,178
stack to you.

137
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,949
We then meet developers and teams, you know, wherever they are

138
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,309
to access those models. So,

139
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,108
um, they can be accessed through a multitude of different IDEs.

140
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,250
We talked about software engineering use cases we're

141
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,259
gonna see this in just a minute, um,

142
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:05,048
as well as through

143
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,470
a terminal CLI, uh, encoding agents

144
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,970
for, for software engineers,

145
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,509
um, but it's Poolside's built for the whole

146
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,660
organization. So although, you know, we'll call out products

147
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,920
like our API and our IDE,

148
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,809
uh, and, uh, even non-developers will use Poolside

149
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:20,019
through our agent orchestration platform, and I'll show

150
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,170
a little bit of that, uh, here in, here in a demo,

151
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:24,809
uh. But, um,

152
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,970
the, the takeaway here is that we build really the back

153
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,410
end model structure and the front end interface

154
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,528
for your, for your team. So when you have poolside,

155
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,988
you have, in this case, the model infrastructure

156
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,350
and all the product interfaces.

157
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:38,410
This all again gets deployed in your

158
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,569
uh secured network. Now poolside's really truly

159
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:41,649
isolated AI

160
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,170
for your organization, and this enables us to work

161
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,189
with even the most highly regulated,

162
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,420
uh, you know, financial services companies, public

163
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,108
sector companies,

164
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:51,769
uh, they can leverage frontier AI tools

165
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,629
without, in this case,

166
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:55,389
uh, the risk of data egress or some sort of,

167
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,798
um, uh, uh, data leaving the network. It's,

168
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,850
it's a stack that they can deploy for

169
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,358
their entire organization.

170
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:03,264
And we can design this whole stack

171
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,324
to where maybe it's a single deployment of poolside or

172
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,403
multiple deployments of poolside for various different

173
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:09,403
programs. So even the most, you

174
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,524
know, mission critical um work can

175
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,803
can leverage a secure AI platform and

176
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,024
over time this uh this stack becomes a

177
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,403
uh an AI software foundation for you to build on because it's

178
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:21,553
all within your control again you have the model weights,

179
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:24,004
you have all the product interfaces, it all it's customized

180
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:24,863
for your security boundary,

181
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:27,803
um, and we don't have the, the risk of data egress,

182
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:30,084
you know, losing core IP for your business

183
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,139
so. We don't require or want

184
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,298
any of your data to, to make this stack better, we

185
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,980
give it to you and let you customize it.

186
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,959
Uh, we have two models available today in our stack.

187
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,488
Malibu Agent is our gente model. Uh, Point

188
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,588
is our, is our auto completion model for code,

189
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,709
uh, and they can be, uh, deployed

190
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,129
entirely within your organization's, uh, AWS

191
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,250
account, uh, either in an AWS

192
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,899
VPC,

193
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,250
uh, or Amazon Bedrock. Um, we

194
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,399
also can track entirely through your existing

195
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,250
AWS agreement.

196
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,649
So we have a fairly rare tier one agreement

197
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,350
with AWS,

198
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,040
allowing customers to use their existing AWS agreement

199
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,629
and, and, uh, committed spend,

200
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,488
uh, to use, to use Poolside.

201
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,920
Uh, so I'm gonna pass it over to Ivo, and I wanna dig

202
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,410
in, um, here for a few minutes on

203
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,579
how to deploy Poolside within an AWS account.

204
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,559
That Thank you. Not the mic.

205
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,470
Uh, cool.

206
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,959
So I think we saw a lot of slides that didn't show any

207
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,040
AWS thingish, right?

208
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,119
And you're also in AWS conference. So I wanna get you

209
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,199
started on what we actually deploy in your

210
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:26,838
environment, right?

211
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,358
As Coty said, this is completely

212
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,470
within your account. We don't have any SAS offering right

213
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,250
now, so we actually deploy this with you.

214
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,129
Uh, you, we help you deploy in, in your specific

215
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,129
account. Starting from the bottom, I'd like

216
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,439
to walk you through the diagram. So it's a very simple architecture

217
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,028
as you can see.

218
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:43,488
Uh, we have like a database, post squares. It's

219
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:44,088
an RDS,

220
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,689
uh, and then we can have the brains of the operation which

221
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:47,949
is our EKS cluster.

222
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,759
Uh, EKS cluster is where things start to get

223
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,970
interesting, right? So you'll see two node groups there. One is grayed

224
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,048
out, uh, because it's optional. So our

225
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,230
mandatory node group is like a CPO node group.

226
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,629
This is actually where our API runs,

227
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,298
web assistants, which is basically like a UI, right?

228
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,040
Uh, and then you have optional node group which is GPUs,

229
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:05,608
in this case P.

230
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,028
5s, uh, and it's optional because you can also

231
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,238
deploy on Bedrock,

232
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,160
and by deploy I mean you can use it, right?

233
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,608
You either choose to use, uh, your own GPUs

234
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,639
and we give you the wage for that, or you run

235
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,759
on Bedrock and you just call the API from, from

236
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,798
the CPU networks. Uh, you see like a

237
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,928
bunch of auxiliary services here too, right? You

238
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,040
see S3, you see CR,

239
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,569
uh, and the reason for that is because like we

240
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,858
have to host our, our things somewhere

241
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,119
to access it. Very simple. You just

242
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,509
access it through a load balancer. You see it is in a public subnet,

243
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,769
so you know it couldn't be a simpler architecture.

244
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,379
Uh, but some of our customers, as you'll

245
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,717
see with NGC and others,

246
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,817
are very secure focused.

247
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:41,898
Security

248
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,587
is a tier one construct for AWS as

249
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,859
well, and they told us, uh, we cannot have internet

250
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,928
access at all, so they cannot have an IGW on

251
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,597
their VPC.

252
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Uh, and for us it is fine. We support it

253
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,519
too. If you look at this architecture, we basically

254
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,178
replaced the whole,

255
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,558
uh, public subnet with a private

256
00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:59,639
one, and we created a bunch of

257
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,750
VPC endpoints.

258
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,229
For those not familiar with VPC endpoints, they're just a way

259
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:04,918
for you to access AWS services,

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,658
uh, without going through the internet.

261
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,229
So we still need obviously access to AWS

262
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:10,759
services and this is how we achieve it.

263
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,320
Uh, you also see that now the ALB became

264
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,590
a private ALB. You need to access this somehow.

265
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:17,940
Uh, we just changed it to, to a private one.

266
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Uh, another security aspect from this

267
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,479
architecture, you'll see, I, I put some keys

268
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,678
around all the components

269
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,158
is that some customers can also not use AWS

270
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,239
managed keys. They're very useful to get started,

271
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,359
but not all customers can access those,

272
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,879
so they need to bring their own. This is very common

273
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,119
with security customers. Uh, and you see we

274
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,519
support you to bring your own keys. So from EKS

275
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,058
secrets, on the EBS notes, on the database,

276
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:41,129
so on and so forth.

277
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,889
Um, but when you look at this diagram,

278
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,168
if you are, you know, a little bit networking focused,

279
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,320
you'll see, OK, but how do I access this?

280
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,690
Like there's an ID extension, there's other components

281
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,849
like how am I gonna query this API if this is

282
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,928
an isolated VPC and everything is public.

283
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,479
Uh, and this is where the rest of the stock comes in,

284
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,710
right? So we are not picky. We

285
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,119
support all types of access,

286
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,558
for example, site to site VPN from your on-prem,

287
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,440
maybe client VPM from your employees'

288
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,989
computers,

289
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,399
Direct Connect, you name it. Like it doesn't matter for

290
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,519
us. We help you deploy this and make

291
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,519
sure it works, so we

292
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:14,080
kind of guide you to the deployment.

293
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:16,433
Uh, and you also see that I added the network

294
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,514
firewall there, and the reason I did is because we

295
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:19,173
also support,

296
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:21,673
uh, inspection architectures for this

297
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,494
specific slide. I put it as a centralized,

298
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:24,315
uh,

299
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,793
firewall which we believe this is on BBC. You go to transit gateway

300
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,195
and you are inspected. We also supported the architecture,

301
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:33,014
like, for example, distributed, uh, inspection.

302
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,553
So this is kind of like our architecture, as

303
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,254
you can see,

304
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,663
very simple. You'll be able to access it

305
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:39,844
from everywhere.

306
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,399
Uh, but for those of you that have been using

307
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,479
AWS more for more years, you know

308
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,779
that not all regions are created equally, right? So

309
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,389
it could be from service availability to

310
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,509
simply parts of the service availability.

311
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,879
Maybe sometimes the API is not available equally

312
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,038
everywhere, and this is not very, uh,

313
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:57,440
fun to find after the fact.

314
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,820
So we do support,

315
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,058
uh, many regions.

316
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,379
We kind of. Go with you and we basically check the

317
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,590
region you want to deploy to,

318
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,269
but even within the region, some are different,

319
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,428
and this, they call it partitions. For those not

320
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:10,440
familiar, in NWS partition is

321
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,700
something completely isolated that has regions

322
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,869
inside, uh, and they're only communicated through the

323
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,408
internet. So for example, you cannot use

324
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,019
uh an access key to communicate them, right?

325
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:21,369
Or any sort of TGW. This doesn't work.

326
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,869
Uh, we also support different partitions. You'll

327
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:26,149
see here the commercial one, Golf cloud,

328
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,548
uh, and we also support some that are not in the slide

329
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,489
like the secret region and the top secret region.

330
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,889
Again, I want to emphasize that we do help you deploy

331
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:33,788
this on these

332
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,109
partitions, right? And we kind of guide you

333
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:36,710
all the way.

334
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,629
Uh, I think you guys now

335
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,629
are a little bit familiar with how we deploy.

336
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,330
It's not super complex architecture.

337
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,668
Uh, I wanna also guide you through our customer

338
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,750
approach, right? If you deal with AWS, you

339
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,908
know that customer obsession is very important for

340
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,989
them. It's a leadership principle. They talk

341
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:54,259
about it on all the conferences,

342
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,590
uh, and I was AWS, so I'm very familiar with it.

343
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,869
Uh, at Poolside we can embrace it too,

344
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:00,690
right? So customers for us are

345
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:03,219
very, very important. Important and we wanted to

346
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,759
do right by them and we cannot just install

347
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,739
something and give them the keys and just leave.

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,009
The reason is that most AIPOCs right now

349
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,080
are failing, right? I think there's a statistic

350
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,269
from MIT says like something like 95%,

351
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:14,928
I think it is,

352
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,200
don't reach production, right?

353
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,558
So if I just give you the access to our model, no matter

354
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:22,000
how good our model is, no matter how good our agents are,

355
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,479
most likely you have like a 5% chance to make

356
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,609
this success, right?

357
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,399
And that's why we at Poolside guide you

358
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:28,979
all the way

359
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,759
to until you reach production.

360
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,519
Our SA and SCs help you become

361
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,710
what we like to call

362
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:36,229
agentic organization.

363
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,529
What does this mean? It's not just a keyword, I promise.

364
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,029
We help you

365
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:43,879
achieve your use cases by creating new agents,

366
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,168
maybe doing like some prompt engineering, but

367
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:48,330
actually what we try to own with you are

368
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,269
the actual business outcomes.

369
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:53,288
We do this in a more, I would say, consultative

370
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:53,830
approach,

371
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,649
and it's been working out for us,

372
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,969
but some specific clusters needed even more than

373
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:00,090
that. They needed like a boots on the

374
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,869
ground, hands on the keyboard approach,

375
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:04,239
uh, and that's why we created a 4

376
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:04,788
deployed

377
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,250
research engineering motion.

378
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,058
What are these guys?

379
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,690
Well, they are applied research engineers,

380
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,200
right? So they are not some typical

381
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,139
LinkedIn influencer that says

382
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,219
KV cash and gets a bunch of likes, OK?

383
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,739
So they are really people with experience

384
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:20,788
taking POCs to production in AI,

385
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,820
OK? Uh, and they help you

386
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,038
as an extension of your team.

387
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,558
So, they will work within your teams, within your

388
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,099
engineering,

389
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,119
product teams,

390
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,399
uh, and they will help you achieve your use

391
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,940
cases. This could be, you know, creating a new pipeline,

392
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,359
maybe creating a new agent, or maybe just

393
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,090
scaling this to thousands of users.

394
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,859
They are an extension of your team, really.

395
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,038
And by now I see your faces. So, if you

396
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,340
forget everything I said so far,

397
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:48,869
what I want you to take from this talk, OK,

398
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,359
is that poolside is not just about tokens,

399
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,619
OK? It's about business outcomes.

400
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,779
We are an enterprise-focused organization

401
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,178
and we help you.

402
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,899
Uh, have a shared responsibility model with

403
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,460
us, owning those outcomes.

404
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,739
So I don't just hand you the keys to the

405
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:05,158
model and say, you know, have fun,

406
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,200
uh, but we actually help you

407
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,298
get the best out of that.

408
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,950
Um, I, I'm engineering, as Corey said,

409
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:12,989
I'm a prisma engineer,

410
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,418
uh, and I'm not about just talk, so I wanna

411
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,609
show you real

412
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,509
demos,

413
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,750
uh, and for that I'll call Corey

414
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,149
that is gonna show you how all of this actually works.

415
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:23,408
Yeah, thank you so much, Iva.

416
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,178
Yeah, so let's dig into some of the use case demos

417
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,399
and uh this stack in action

418
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,759
with with the software focus, um,

419
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,739
uh, running with enterprise code.

420
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,178
Uh, the first demo here is a clear

421
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:38,250
case that we were able to help, uh, uh,

422
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,000
software teams with, especially teams that work in,

423
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,500
uh, legacy systems and or

424
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,379
closed environments.

425
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,808
Um, in this demo we're going to, uh,

426
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,058
show how the, uh, poolside. Uh,

427
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,330
ID extension and model, um,

428
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,389
converts a non-trivial ata code database

429
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:54,590
project into, into Rust.

430
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,908
Uh, what you'll see in the demo, I'll play it in just a sec,

431
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:58,349
uh, is, um,

432
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,629
the ID extension walking through this

433
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:01,239
code base,

434
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,450
understanding its structure

435
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,058
using tools, uh, and then rewriting

436
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:06,009
that, that, that structure.

437
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,609
Um, if anyone, I see a few

438
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,649
head nods or unfamiliar with AA code.

439
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,849
I was um before I started working with a few different

440
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,960
customers who use it. Ada code is a, a

441
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,629
legacy language.

442
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Um, it was originally released in the early 80s.

443
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:20,330
It was uh developed by the US

444
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,469
Department of Defense and it's still used in very, in

445
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,149
many mission critical

446
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,590
applications in aerospace and aeronautics. So,

447
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:27,389
um,

448
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:30,168
uh, let's, let's get started and see, see this in action.

449
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:35,960
So I'll do my best to, to pause and narrate

450
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,000
here. What um you're seeing is,

451
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,119
is kind of the initial prompt to rewrite

452
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,940
this, this, uh, this codebase,

453
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,269
and uh you already see on the

454
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:45,440
left hand side there in the chat,

455
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:48,019
yeah, your, your right hand side.

456
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,509
Uh, there in the chat is, uh, the ability

457
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,548
for the, the agent and the model to start using tools,

458
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:55,009
right? So we're reading and grabbing through the code base.

459
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,229
Um, this is all poolside. It's important

460
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,500
to note that this is the poolside model, the poolside agent.

461
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,710
We are using an open source IDE as our

462
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,058
client here. Um, however, the ID extension

463
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:06,668
is also built by us, so the, the interfaces

464
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:09,149
are all poolside and the back end model is all poolside.

465
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,668
What you'll notice here as I play this, uh,

466
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,210
is that the inner monologue of the model also

467
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,529
creates this to do list and it breaks this down

468
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:18,529
much like how a senior software engineer would want to break this

469
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,529
down. We're rewriting a database, right? So

470
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,729
we need to think about the table structure, the record

471
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:25,109
structure, then we need to rewrite the query parser.

472
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,479
Um, each one of these steps

473
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,940
is potentially a new file, um,

474
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,330
potentially editing an existing file in the,

475
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,570
in the call chain, uh, and the agent

476
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,668
is kind of traversing here.

477
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:37,090
You also see it start to use different shell commands to

478
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,869
actually test its work as we get along.

479
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,580
Um, rewriting its, its implementation

480
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,719
as it might finds errors in its own code,

481
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,048
uh, and at the end of this demo we'll see

482
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,178
that we can actually go into the shell here after

483
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:49,779
we have a nice output of what it completed,

484
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:53,769
uh, and then test out some database commands,

485
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,070
and it's now a code to Rust, uh,

486
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,979
Rust style database.

487
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,090
So a single agent uh in the poolside

488
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,668
stack,

489
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,129
uh, running inside the IDE keep that in

490
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,250
mind, we're in the kind of the single agent process right

491
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,088
now. In

492
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:10,189
the next demo, uh, we're going to,

493
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,549
uh, work with um a multi-agent scenario, but

494
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,588
in this case we're gonna work in a in a headless fashion.

495
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:16,989
So imagine we're in the financial

496
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,019
services use case we have a,

497
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,519
a, a, a kind of demo stock trading app here,

498
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,809
uh, showing that, um, we might want to

499
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,930
traverse multiple issues that are

500
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:28,489
going wrong in our, in our program, um,

501
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,650
and. Uh, we're actually going to be using the

502
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,739
API and the agent runtime here with the

503
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,500
model, but outside of the IDE.

504
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,979
So in this case, we're going to be having

505
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:39,059
this AI enabled SDLC and the

506
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,180
agent model and uh interfaces

507
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,759
are going to be completing units of work

508
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,420
without necessarily the developer having to pull down

509
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,578
the code and um and initiate

510
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:49,660
that unit of work. So I'll go ahead and play

511
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,180
that in

512
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,118
um and narrate along the way.

513
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,779
So what you'll see is that we're using GitHub

514
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,059
issues here, just GitHub natives to track

515
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,828
uh issues with the project.

516
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:07,250
Um, and I'm gonna go ahead and pause that

517
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,078
because what we ended up doing is adding

518
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,338
a certain label to a GitHub

519
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,338
issue. Now, this label called the

520
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,479
pool set agent label is gonna fire off

521
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,199
a pool set agent runtime

522
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,880
that's then going to traverse into GitHub actions

523
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,959
and fire off a workflow.

524
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,029
There's a lot there, but if you were using, say,

525
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:27,759
Jira for project management and Jenkins

526
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,920
for your CICD, this exact flow

527
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,759
could be replicated.

528
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,239
We're the primitives here, in this case, the, the agent

529
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,598
runtime, uh, and the model. However,

530
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,420
we're just using

531
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,039
some pre-built tools to be able to show off, uh,

532
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:39,920
um,

533
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,279
a, uh, a workflow where we're going

534
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,979
to send off, uh, I believe,

535
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:46,380
4 to 3 or 4 agents all at once,

536
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:48,880
uh, to traverse 3 or 4 issues all at once. So

537
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,118
let me go ahead and play that again.

538
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,838
And we can walk through.

539
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,729
So we're adding the, the label to the

540
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:57,729
issues, we're, then we're going to

541
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,848
see the GitHub action workflows start

542
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,348
to uh fire off as well.

543
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,939
So you'll see that we have now, OK, 33,

544
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,670
workflows, uh,

545
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:07,910
in this case,

546
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:11,130
um, working, uh, simultaneously

547
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,719
as 3 kind of parallel agents,

548
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:15,049
all traversing different units of work, creating

549
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,219
the to do list, much like we saw in the IDE

550
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,259
demo. Um, and at the end of the

551
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,500
day, creating 3 pull requests that we can then

552
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,680
review. So this is a truly

553
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,618
like headless

554
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,789
AI enabled SDLC motion where

555
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,259
the, the code that you're seeing there in that pull request was

556
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,500
generated by the model, but it was generated by the agent

557
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,539
runtime that actually just ran in the GetUp actions

558
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,140
container,

559
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,900
um, full automation that we could lift

560
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,979
and shift, say different project management

561
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,338
or different CICD tools to be able to implement

562
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:43,739
in, say your organization's very secure

563
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,809
network. So the

564
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,150
first demo was single agent running in the IDE,

565
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,969
um, the second demo here, parallel agents

566
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:51,670
running in

567
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,890
a virtual machine in this case.

568
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,108
And the third demo is our agent orchestration

569
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,209
uh pipeline. So in this demo

570
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,229
we're going to have multiple agents chained together

571
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,430
as a, a, a longer pipeline,

572
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:06,108
and this pipeline is going to do some service investigation into

573
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,650
an EKS cluster that something is going wrong.

574
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,108
Imagine a new ticket comes through and

575
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,130
um where you need to diagnose kind of an infrastructure

576
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,890
service issue.

577
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,229
In this case, a user can't see their orders for

578
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:18,890
their account. Maybe that's a a

579
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,549
a a potential workflow, um, but

580
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,549
instead of, uh, manually traversing and

581
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:24,410
trying to figure out, OK,

582
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:27,279
which one of the order services or authentication

583
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,348
services or various services is inside of

584
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,400
the CKS cluster. Going wrong, we're going

585
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,640
to start an agentic pipeline and

586
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,239
fire off a multi-agent workflow chaining

587
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,640
the output of one agent to the next in this agent

588
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,029
orchestration platform. Again, all poolside

589
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,039
here, so the poolside agent runtime, the

590
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,328
poolside model, the poolside workflow,

591
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,430
um, getting to the point

592
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,430
where we can generate a report and say with, uh,

593
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,390
you know, in this case a high likelihood it's actually, you

594
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,739
know, this particular service that we need to go and,

595
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,880
and check out. So let's, let's play that and

596
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,479
see that in action.

597
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,890
So this is, in this case, the single agent workflow,

598
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,189
uh, and it's going to jump in

599
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,239
and and uh be able to discover the different

600
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,410
services that we have,

601
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,358
uh, and, and traverse this,

602
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,759
this longer pipeline. You'll see as well that

603
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,838
all of the agent trajectories and essentially

604
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:20,160
all the agent runs, we also can audit

605
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,259
here because we are both the back-end model

606
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,680
and the front end agent runtime.

607
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,000
Full traceability up and down the stack is,

608
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:27,358
is available with poolside.

609
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,279
If you're out there in the expo, you may see that there's,

610
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,779
um, there's companies that are built

611
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,799
purely around agent tracking, agent trajectories,

612
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,098
but poolside, we're, we're

613
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,650
able to do this because we, we're the full stack,

614
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,699
right? So, um, you kind of have, in

615
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,858
this case, a full stack solution to be able to build

616
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,858
these longer pipelines, um, and do

617
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:47,759
it securely with data sources that you may not

618
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:48,759
necessarily.

619
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,670
In this case, add to NAI pipeline,

620
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,229
uh, without something like Poolside.

621
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:07,108
And there's the end is kind of a nice report that

622
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,269
says, hey, this is what, what, what, what we need

623
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,269
to um uh traverse and figure

624
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:11,930
out kind of

625
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,670
uh where we need to go to figure out this issue, so.

626
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,969
Poolside sees a future where, you know, every enterprise

627
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,328
is going to want hundreds if not thousands of agents,

628
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,549
either in that single agent flow or

629
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:28,009
multiple agent pipelines, uh,

630
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,439
using various data sources. And from our perspective,

631
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:32,559
when we try to play this out 1824

632
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,189
months from now,

633
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,269
it makes. makes it even more crucial that

634
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,509
organizations, especially those in high consequence,

635
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,269
high secure environments and

636
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:42,439
organizations, um, own their stack, you know, secure

637
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,098
their infrastructure

638
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,519
around their AI platform, not letting the data leave the

639
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,559
network on Poolside, we really aim to be

640
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,750
that solution,

641
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:51,140
uh, and, uh, we're proud that

642
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,239
we've been able to be that solution for a variety of high

643
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,598
consequence organizations like NGC. So

644
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,719
I'm gonna pass it over to Praveen, uh, to hear on

645
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,880
their journey with Poolside.

646
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:02,689
Thanks, Corey.

647
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,108
So Northrop Grumman Space manages

648
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:08,180
uh mission critical systems,

649
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,680
and this is from uh

650
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,098
satellite constellation operations

651
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,088
to

652
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,759
multitude of other like on orbit

653
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,430
services, and these are assets,

654
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,318
not only high value assets but also

655
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,848
require really secure and hardened

656
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,618
systems all the way from the algorithmic

657
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,219
developments to deployments, testing

658
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,539
on the entire pipeline,

659
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,150
so. We have been

660
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:37,338
Focused on ensuring that

661
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,959
the architecture from

662
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,500
the beginning is secure and stays

663
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,400
secure as we bring in new tools

664
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,199
and use these tools for

665
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,729
development purposes.

666
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:47,759
So that's where

667
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:48,799
the

668
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:51,739
like the primary reliance on a

669
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:52,868
hardened cloud like

670
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:54,838
AWS's

671
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,880
is uh

672
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,140
pretty important for us and

673
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,660
the fact that poolside we are able to

674
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,400
completely.

675
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,049
Integrate that and also

676
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:06,469
maintain the air gap system without any

677
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:08,328
access to external

678
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,130
systems, um,

679
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,189
that is very key for us and

680
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,608
also it allows full control

681
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:16,469
from

682
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,868
the end to end

683
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,650
debugging, testing code development

684
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,430
and all the way to.

685
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:25,130
Like full loop validation of the systems

686
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,949
that we really

687
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,469
integrate uh with other

688
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,989
data systems that are private

689
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,750
and that makes

690
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,838
for the case that the in

691
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:38,029
addition to the other

692
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:40,949
options that we had, it was very important to

693
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:43,189
ensure that the models that we use

694
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:45,348
to request and

695
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:46,910
serve endpoints

696
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:49,769
are not outside of the systems.

697
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,578
That we control. So that

698
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:53,640
was another key

699
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,239
important aspect for us

700
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:56,880
and in terms of

701
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,279
the existing

702
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,170
hardened configuration,

703
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,779
including the ts standards and guidelines

704
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:04,318
that

705
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,979
uh exist in our existing systems,

706
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,219
whenever there's a new tool we need to

707
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,420
ensure that uh that is also

708
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,059
taken care all the way from the OS

709
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:14,578
application layer.

710
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:17,243
To the network ingress egress

711
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:19,703
and the fact that the compliance

712
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:21,904
can be maintained was another key

713
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,463
um important factor for us.

714
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:25,943
And this goes with PIPS 140

715
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,493
in terms of uh ensuring any cryptographic

716
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,963
implications or also

717
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,818
FIPS compliant and

718
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,630
that's one of the key aspects.

719
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,979
And I'll walk through some of

720
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:39,880
the use cases we've been

721
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:42,348
um exploring with Poolside uh

722
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:44,500
which stresses on

723
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,729
the importance of having the sovereignty

724
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:48,000
over like the data

725
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,299
and also the IP that a

726
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,880
company like us would kind of use

727
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,410
and.

728
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,078
So, on the documentation side, it

729
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:58,150
is very typical for us,

730
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,959
or in our use cases to enrich

731
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,150
existing code bases

732
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,140
with more

733
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:05,959
documentations, not just within the

734
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:08,400
code, but also pulling data from other

735
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,759
systems like where we define tasks

736
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,578
and system-level descriptions.

737
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,039
But being confident that we

738
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,640
can pull in those into the context of the agents

739
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,539
and the models.

740
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,588
While ensuring that we don't

741
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,630
send data to a remote

742
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,250
endpoint

743
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,568
uh across the network is

744
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,759
pretty

745
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:31,289
base minimum level requirement from our side

746
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,549
and so we've been

747
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:35,029
happy with that uh capability

748
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,250
that we are able to.

749
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,309
Use internal data

750
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,689
because we know that the the model is

751
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,719
being served on the closed

752
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,019
air gap environment

753
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,939
and with that

754
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,289
not only the documentation

755
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:50,529
is much more enhanced with the

756
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,608
code level details but also with system

757
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,818
level details that it

758
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:57,029
then reinforces the context

759
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:59,160
that are more important and relevant for the systems

760
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,150
that are being developed

761
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,469
and likewise same goes for

762
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:05,608
the. Test generation pipeline

763
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,348
previously you had to depend on unit level

764
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:11,150
tests that are very siloed

765
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,029
given a code context, but.

766
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:16,189
The fact that we can now extend it

767
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:18,219
to internal end to end test

768
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,160
but also require system level understanding

769
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,130
uh is a key enablement

770
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,719
for us

771
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,219
and also

772
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:28,130
like one of the examples we saw from the

773
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,618
code uh like code refactoring agents

774
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:32,469
with Ada's full porto so

775
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:34,858
there are

776
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,779
systems, not just legacy for legacy.

777
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,848
purposes, but they are really

778
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:43,328
hardened and tested well for

779
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,650
really. Spacecraft

780
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,049
grade uh requirements and

781
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,519
the fact that now we can leverage these advanced

782
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,949
agents to be able to port over

783
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,868
with like the same levels of reliability

784
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,380
has been a key enabler.

785
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,068
So with that I'll

786
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,068
pass it back to

787
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,500
Corey. Yeah, thank you

788
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,269
so much, Praveen.

789
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,180
And uh just, just to wrap this up here,

790
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,299
um, uh, uh.

791
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,410
Poolside, you know, it, it, it, as we learned

792
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,568
in that first section, we're frontier Model lab

793
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,890
building secure enterprise AI systems

794
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,130
that can be deployed anywhere. Uh,

795
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,729
we build these AI models and the AI orchestration

796
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:24,199
platform. This is all from scratch,

797
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,608
uh, that is designed to run entirely with your

798
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,650
within your own infrastructure, even in an air gapped,

799
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,348
uh, scenario.

800
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:30,410
As an organization,

801
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,750
you, you with Poolside, you have an isolated AI

802
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,729
stack that you can build on for the future,

803
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,348
uh, and you'll receive, you know, the latest model

804
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,430
updates as we, as we publish them. We are a frontier lab.

805
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,910
We're continually doing more and more model training, building

806
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,059
better and better and more capable models, um,

807
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,269
as we have those, you will get them, uh,

808
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:48,469
but not risk the data egress or,

809
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:50,709
you know, losing core IP of your business. And

810
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,828
as, uh, Eva pointed out, we have a customer

811
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:53,469
approach built

812
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,078
around if needed for deployed research engineers,

813
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,250
uh, that we can power this software stack with.

814
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:00,828
Uh, our 4 deployed research engineers embed

815
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:03,029
with your team, uh, and help you solve even

816
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:04,189
the most mission critical,

817
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,868
complex, uh, challenges with agents. Give us the

818
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:08,989
most complex, hardest, uh, hardest

819
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:11,170
problem to solve as this agent orchestration

820
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,709
pipeline.

821
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:14,239
All this again is, you know, behind your firewall,

822
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:15,380
so it's this mix of

823
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,910
software and, uh, and, and

824
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,088
teams and people and research engineers, uh,

825
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:22,160
to help, you know, your organization regardless of

826
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,439
where that organization, in this case for

827
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,759
this talk develops software or

828
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,949
in maybe another business process,

829
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,229
uh, has a business outcome they want to

830
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,439
enable with uh

831
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,759
uh AI to create and become this

832
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,299
agentic uh organization, this agentic enterprise.

833
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:41,400
So if you'd like to dig in more, um, I believe

834
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,539
we actually have some extra time, uh, built

835
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:45,739
into this talk, and we can take some questions off

836
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:47,779
stage, um, or you can come visit our booth

837
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,858
out in the expo hall again,

838
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,219
uh, 802, come get some poolside swag and

839
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,400
talk to us about how we can help out your organization.

840
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,299
Thanks.
