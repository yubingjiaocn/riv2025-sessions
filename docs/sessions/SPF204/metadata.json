  "abstract": "PGA TOUR has revolutionized its content creation process by implementing a multi-agent AI system, utilizing specialized agents for editing, writing, research, and strategy. This innovative approach generates comprehensive tournament coverage, including player and tournament previews, recaps, viewing guides, and betting insights. The system has dramatically reduced content production costs from thousands of dollars per tournament to just 25 cents per article while maintaining high-quality, consistent coverage across all platforms. Not only the cost since they are able to publish these articles within minutes of play completion, they have the highest number of hits in the history as this information is not available anywhere else(ESPN, Google, News websites, sports websites). This transformation demonstrates the powerful impact of agentic AI in sports journalism and content creation.",
  "abstract_cn": "PGA巡回赛通过实施多智能体AI系统彻底改革了其内容创作流程，该系统利用专门的智能体进行编辑、写作、研究和策略制定。这种创新方法生成全面的锦标赛报道，包括球员和锦标赛预览、回顾、观看指南以及博彩洞察。该系统将内容制作成本从每场锦标赛数千美元大幅降低至每篇文章仅25美分，同时在所有平台上保持高质量、一致的报道。不仅降低了成本，由于能够在比赛结束后几分钟内发布这些文章，他们获得了历史上最高的点击量，因为这些信息在其他任何地方（ESPN、谷歌、新闻网站、体育网站）都无法获得。这一转型展示了智能体AI在体育新闻和内容创作领域的强大影响力。",
