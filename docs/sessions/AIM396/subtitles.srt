1
00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:04,288
Hey everyone. Welcome to AIM 396,

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:06,459
where we're gonna talk about how to integrate, uh,

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:08,470
open source, uh, frameworks

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,989
with Amazon Bedrock Asian Core.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,310
Uh, my name is Shreya Subramanyan. I'm a

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,819
principal data scientist at AWS.

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:15,429
I also have Ari,

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,129
who's a senior GEI specialist SA at AWS,

9
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:20,510
and we're happy to also share the stage

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,658
with, uh, Keith, who's a VP of Engineering at Coher

11
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:23,969
Health. So

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,429
before we get started, uh, quick show

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,539
of hands, how many of you have, uh,

14
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,670
built an agent with either a no code

15
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,750
tool or low code or, or an open source

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,408
framework?

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,590
Quite, quite a lot of us, yeah, and so you might recognize

18
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,990
some of the frameworks up here and also the protocols.

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,548
So building a basic agent requires piecing

20
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:43,668
together all these different complex components,

21
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,149
right? So you have, uh, picking a framework,

22
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,560
picking what tools to integrate with, you also

23
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,168
have, uh, state management,

24
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,865
but fortunately. Some of these open source frameworks

25
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:54,954
came first and it really simplifies the way

26
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,454
you can build these agents.

27
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,954
Uh, we also have open protocols like NCP

28
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:00,755
and A2A that, uh,

29
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,043
that help with connecting agents to agents or agents

30
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:03,664
or tools.

31
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:06,125
We have open protocols and standards like

32
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,403
OA for, uh, authorization.

33
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,034
We have Otel for observability, and all of

34
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:11,974
these help you

35
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,555
start off really quickly and build a POC.

36
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,954
But going from POC to production is

37
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:17,855
a totally different

38
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:19,114
ball game, right?

39
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,480
So at AWS

40
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:23,879
since its inception we've been contributing to open

41
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,250
source and we're proud to do that.

42
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,819
Uh, we think open source is good for everyone.

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,159
Uh, we've been, uh, you know, contributing to

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,319
Linux Foundation, the open source

45
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,079
projects on GitHub,

46
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,819
uh, both, uh, you know, we're, we're in the,

47
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,198
um, Asians related talks, so

48
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,198
we thought we contribute to strands, which

49
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:40,719
is our own.

50
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:43,194
Uh, Asiantic framework with, uh, and also with

51
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:45,234
other open source frameworks we believe open

52
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:47,534
source is good for everyone. We're committed to bringing this,

53
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:50,114
uh, via managed services to

54
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:52,174
our customers and you'll hear from,

55
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:54,543
uh, Keith at Goher Health and, uh, uh,

56
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,933
on more about this as well.

57
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,219
So today we'll be talking about specifically

58
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,459
how Asian Core works with open

59
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,579
source frameworks. If you haven't been

60
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,620
in other Asian Core sessions, so

61
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,819
Asian Core is our end to end Asian

62
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,860
tech platform that helps you build and operate

63
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,099
agents at scale.

64
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,879
Um, and so zooming

65
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,210
out, you know, a 30,000 ft view of,

66
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,258
uh, Asian core, if you look at all of these components

67
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:20,278
that you see on your screen.

68
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,028
Uh, we,

69
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,558
uh, Asian core is comprised of all of these individual

70
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,528
services. You can pick and choose what you want.

71
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,849
Uh, in the center of your screen is, uh,

72
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,110
Asian core runtime.

73
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,849
So with runtime, you can deploy any open

74
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,889
source agent as well as MCP servers

75
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,210
and A2A servers, uh, with

76
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,210
no changes in code or minimal changes in

77
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,538
code. Um, these runtime

78
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,710
agents, uh, run in a session

79
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,868
isolated environment.

80
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,649
Uh, it can be a back and forth, um,

81
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,129
agent where you have a conversational, uh,

82
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,149
interface or you have a long-running agent

83
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,229
that can run for hours and hours, like a deep research

84
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,830
agent, right?

85
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,669
Um, runtime also integrates with all

86
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,669
of these other agent core services.

87
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,270
So for example, runtime integrates with identity,

88
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:02,909
which is our,

89
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:03,868
uh, agent,

90
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,429
uh, identity and credential management

91
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,550
service. It also integrates with memory, which

92
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,830
is, um,

93
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,149
the first, uh, one of the first, uh, enterprise

94
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,169
grade memory capabilities that you can have

95
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,308
zero infrastructure set up, but you have short-term

96
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:18,550
and long-term memory, uh, that can attach

97
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,330
to your agents,

98
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:21,808
um. We also recently introduced

99
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:24,028
policy and evals in Asian core,

100
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:26,199
so this helps you constrain and also

101
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,479
judge how well your agents are doing in in in production.

102
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,449
Um, what connects all of these

103
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,990
different services together is, uh,

104
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,139
observability or Asian Core Observatory, which

105
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,508
works on the open telemetry

106
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,490
or hotel format.

107
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,990
The nice thing with Agent Core, as I said, was

108
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,050
you can pick and choose

109
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,460
whatever services you want and, uh, to

110
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,479
build your, you know, Asiane application.

111
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:50,139
And uh today we'll see uh

112
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,219
different flavors of observability, for example, so

113
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,300
Keith, uh Keith will talk about arrays and

114
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
how they use that in production. Ari will talk

115
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,469
about how uh we can use lang fuse

116
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,258
with uh, with Asian core as well.

117
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,360
So before we get into

118
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,960
uh the details, let's start with a really basic

119
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,770
scenario, right?

120
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,179
So let's say you have uh your customers, you

121
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:10,058
wanna, uh,

122
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,419
uh, you wanna track an order and you're,

123
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,479
you're usually contacting customer service

124
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,019
and this uh customer service representative

125
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,238
might have to uh look into

126
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,619
like order management system or external shipping

127
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:23,699
provider API or maybe even call

128
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,420
them to get, get order status, right?

129
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,160
Uh, they might also have to work with other technical,

130
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,000
uh, support, uh, you know, human

131
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,059
resources, so you have two teams

132
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,439
working together to actually get your final answer,

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,858
uh, which a lot of times is have you start

134
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:40,139
try restarting it. So, uh, you know, after

135
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,139
all of that effort you might get back an answer

136
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,069
in a couple of days.

137
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,199
We're gonna try and replace these,

138
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,540
uh, two humans, uh, or human

139
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,769
resources teams out there with, uh,

140
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,980
agents, right? So you have a customer service agent.

141
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,480
And a technical support agent. Now these agents

142
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,100
may not replace the entire

143
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,509
functionality of the jobs to be done of, of,

144
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,639
uh, these persons. Uh, it might

145
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,639
just have to do a partial job or might be a

146
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,100
co-pilot that's domain specific

147
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,899
as well. So

148
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,798
how do you get started? The first gut reaction

149
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:13,069
we have is to look into open source frameworks

150
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,509
because open source frameworks have,

151
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,160
you know, deep and, uh, wide integrations

152
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,428
and community support, and, uh, we have great

153
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,509
examples that you can start off with, right? So our gut reaction

154
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:22,189
is usually there,

155
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,600
but how do you pick which framework you have to start

156
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,790
with? Uh, there are a lot of different

157
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,059
factors including how your team is,

158
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,410
uh, working with certain,

159
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,889
uh, frameworks already,

160
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,329
but, uh, we're listing three top,

161
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:36,548
uh, you know, frameworks in our minor list, so

162
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,709
Landgraf, crew AI, and strands agents,

163
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,350
and, uh, we're just listing a few factors that you can

164
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,428
choose, uh, your agent tech frameworks

165
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:46,178
with. Uh, so Landgraf offers a graph-based

166
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,269
execution with extensive open

167
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,750
source, uh, integrations.

168
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,488
So it's powerful, but then it has a really steep,

169
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,750
uh, learning curve compared to some of the other frameworks.

170
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,108
So it is, it's still good for complex

171
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,269
agent orchestration, uh, with strong

172
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:00,009
community support.

173
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,750
Uh, crew AI, on the other hand is really easy

174
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,869
to get started with and especially for role-based

175
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:06,939
and team-based agents where you're, you're running

176
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,048
a multi-agent crew,

177
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,209
uh, this is the best place to start

178
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,778
with, uh, strands, which is our

179
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:15,019
own open source agenttic framework. Uh,

180
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,588
you, you provide, uh, we provide like a model-based

181
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,884
approach and, uh. Has

182
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,894
access to local as well as Asian core memory,

183
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:24,095
for example, and this is ideal for a

184
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,694
starting point for uh enterprise grade enttic

185
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,574
applications that are running on AWS, right?

186
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,894
So you have all of these choices. You might have many more

187
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:33,045
we in fact have many applications and,

188
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:35,134
uh, and, uh, use cases that we have put

189
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,834
in our GitHub repository they can check out.

190
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,559
Uh, but the good thing is you can pick and choose,

191
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,939
uh, the frameworks for, uh, the

192
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,129
right job, right? So you, in this case we're

193
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,329
picking strands for the customer service agent

194
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,608
and, uh, land graph for the technical support

195
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,119
agent.

196
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,649
You don't have to choose two different frameworks. You can choose the

197
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,420
same framework as well,

198
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,358
but in, in this case, as an example, we're saying,

199
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,879
uh, where you're choosing strands for customer support and Land

200
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,040
graph for technical support.

201
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,678
So what's the best way to get started

202
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,959
with that, right? So you have, let's say, a

203
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,009
strands customer support agent that's running locally

204
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,199
on your laptop. You have, uh, local credentials

205
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,519
in there. Uh, the credentials let you

206
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,178
access APIs that are hosted in AWS,

207
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,798
and, uh, these A AWS APIs,

208
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,100
you know, you can access because you have local credentials.

209
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,548
Uh, the technical support agent, uh,

210
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:23,970
you're, you're doing some hard, uh, integration

211
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,439
between the stand support, uh, agent and technical

212
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:26,959
support agent.

213
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,790
And uh what you also see is that the customer

214
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,928
support agent has an API key that may

215
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,829
that may integrate with an external service provider.

216
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,108
Uh, but you can quickly notice that this is

217
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,309
not gonna scale, right? So this is running on your laptop.

218
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,509
It's not something that you can, you can host

219
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,629
and you can have multiple users interact

220
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,920
with. But your goal is to, you know, put

221
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,119
this out for, you know, tens of thousands of users

222
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,509
to use. So how do you do that?

223
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:52,000
That's where agent core runtime comes in, and

224
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
we spoke about Acore runtime a little bit. This

225
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,678
is where, uh, you know, we mentioned line graph

226
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,119
strands and other agenttic frameworks. You can very easily

227
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,160
host these, uh,

228
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,829
these agents, and you get a dedicated endpoint.

229
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,119
These endpoints scale automatically based on

230
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,939
your, uh, requests, and you can,

231
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,399
uh, go from zero to production really quickly,

232
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,759
right? Uh, you can also connect

233
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,838
these agents to any model provider, so it doesn't

234
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,000
have to be Bedrock. It can be OpenAI. It could be any

235
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,019
model provider pretty much,

236
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,720
and, uh, you can also work with really strict

237
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
security guidelines, so it could be a VPC only

238
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,608
mode or you can only use OA.

239
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,238
Uh, we also introduced, uh, resource-based

240
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,160
access policies recently.

241
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Uh, today we also launched full support

242
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,719
for the MCP spec. So if you have an MCP server,

243
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,158
you can, uh, you can go and host the MCP

244
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,639
server without any change in code.

245
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,279
Uh, also, bi-directional streaming was launched recently,

246
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,460
which is useful for something like our customer service,

247
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,798
uh, agent, right? So you're doing right now

248
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,798
imagine a text-based interface, but imagine you wanna

249
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:47,918
convert that to a voice-based interface. You can

250
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,000
very easily do that with runtime because runtime

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,658
now supports bi-directional streaming.

252
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,639
All right. So how do you actually,

253
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,080
you know, host these two agents we said there's a

254
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,308
customer support agent and this Land graph agent.

255
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,739
How do you host that on runtime?

256
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,359
Uh, there's two main methods to do that. You can either

257
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,840
package up your code in the, in a docker container.

258
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,779
That Docker container gets pushed to an ECR repository,

259
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,308
and that ECR repository can be used as,

260
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,239
uh, the starting point for deploying to runtime.

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,070
Uh, the other even easier way is you

262
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,279
can zip up your, uh, deployments in a,

263
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:19,139
in a zip file,

264
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,639
and, uh, you can push that to S3 bucket, and then

265
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,759
that S3 bucket becomes a starting point for

266
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,759
your deployments and run. So it's 22 different

267
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,399
methods,

268
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,879
uh, and to do this you have to actually

269
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,918
make a few lines of, uh, code

270
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,899
change, right? And this basically says,

271
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:33,678
um,

272
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,359
you know, make the right imports from the Bedrock Asian core

273
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,479
SDK, uh, initialize this

274
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,570
app which is actually a star app.

275
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,529
Um, and, um, and then

276
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,889
you have a decorator. It's easy decorator at

277
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,250
app. entry point just points to this

278
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,408
handler or this entry point as the starting point

279
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:50,769
for your agent execution.

280
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,129
What happens inside that my agent function

281
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,320
that you see, it's completely up to you

282
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,690
to be any agent, any framework that you're integrating

283
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,070
with, any business logic,

284
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:01,129
uh, and then finally you return a response.

285
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,808
What do you expect to work is,

286
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,369
um, you know, whether it's sync or as sync

287
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,408
responses or if it's streaming responses, all of

288
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:08,070
those should work,

289
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,808
you know, as though it was running locally.

290
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,719
And this will with runtime, right?

291
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,509
So now that you've made those little changes in your code,

292
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,769
the next step is actually to use our Bedrock

293
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,029
Asian code starter toolkit.

294
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:20,700
This is a really simple way to go from,

295
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,178
uh, you know, a, a code that exists locally

296
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,279
to a code that can, can be deployed. You

297
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,119
have 3 steps.

298
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,599
The first step is to agent is to do Asian

299
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,428
core configure.

300
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,879
So Asian core configure will basically set

301
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,918
up your things like ECR repository that you

302
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,109
want to land in, uh, your role, uh,

303
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,678
whether you want IAM or OA,

304
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:40,489
uh, all of that just sits in a config file that's

305
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,639
local. You can go back in and edit it on your own

306
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,678
as well, but easy to manage

307
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,558
it with Asian core.

308
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,129
Uh, the Asian Corres CLI also has this

309
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,279
next step which is deploy. So you can do Asian core

310
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,288
deploy, which will deploy to

311
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:54,330
run time depending on those two choices that if

312
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,719
you recall from the previous slide, so you have either the container

313
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,808
version or the zip deployment version.

314
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,250
And finally, you know,

315
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,808
within a minute it'll be deployed and you can start invoking

316
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:03,408
your agent.

317
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:05,840
All of the scaling and infrastructure management, all

318
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,849
of that is, you know, happily managed behind

319
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,548
the scenes, and you don't have to worry about it.

320
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,239
Once you've, uh, launched that agent, of course,

321
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
you can start invoking it. And in this

322
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,580
case, we're saying, OK, we're gonna use two different

323
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,190
runtimes,

324
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,580
one for the sciences agent, one for the Landgraf

325
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,639
agent. Uh, there are use cases

326
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,719
where you want both to coexist, but in this

327
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,879
case, we're saying you can have, you know, two different containers

328
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,779
that are running up for you.

329
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:28,960
Um,

330
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,379
everything else remains the same, meaning the Asian

331
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,460
core runtime has an execution role. It

332
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,769
lets you access AWS, uh, APIs.

333
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,369
Um, it also, you can use identity

334
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:40,580
to store, uh, secret credentials, and

335
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
that can be an API key, for example, for your

336
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,619
external shipping provider if you wanna

337
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,719
track a shipment through that API, for example,

338
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,899
um, but if you notice the integration

339
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,479
between these, um,

340
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,099
containers and the API as well as

341
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:56,139
from the one container to another container something that you

342
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,320
manage, right? So.

343
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,599
Um,

344
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,019
before we dive in even deeper there,

345
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,928
let's talk about context engineering for agents.

346
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:06,500
This is, uh, you know, you might have heard about context

347
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,080
engineering and prompt engineering earlier,

348
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,700
uh, but when applied to agent, if we zoom

349
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,979
out, zoom into one of those agents, so either the strands

350
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:13,940
one or the land graph one.

351
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,719
Uh, we can see that the context that you

352
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,808
provide to that agent is extremely important, right?

353
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:21,119
So you can have user instructions, you can have,

354
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,479
um, you know, system instructions, you

355
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,599
have retrieved information from rag systems, for

356
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,798
example, uh, you might have short-term memory

357
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,840
coming in with previous conversations, and you might

358
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,080
have external or internal tools that are giving

359
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,000
you additional context.

360
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
So imagine if your tool uh gives

361
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,219
you, you know, uh, a wrong context

362
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:39,320
or a wrong response,

363
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,729
uh, or worse, if you call the wrong tool, the

364
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,960
LLM calls the wrong tool on your, on your behalf.

365
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,460
That still remains in your context for the

366
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,580
agent and your agent is gonna respond based on

367
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,700
that. So how can we, how can

368
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,950
we make sure that all of this, uh, is

369
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,058
handled, but we don't have to actually handle

370
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:56,580
the integration points, right?

371
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:59,479
So you as a developer are, are

372
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,418
basically responsible for connecting those

373
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:04,609
different nodes, right? So you have the customer service agent

374
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,259
which is strands, uh, you're writing integration

375
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,200
code to connect to your order management system,

376
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,779
writing separate integration code to do an API

377
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,808
call. Um, and then when you're

378
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:15,889
connecting from one agent to another agent, you're also writing

379
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,469
another integration code. So quickly,

380
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,928
your integration code becomes the bulk load

381
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:22,210
of your entire code base, right? You're

382
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,928
not focusing on your business logic, but it's all of this integration

383
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,090
code. But what if you

384
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,070
could use some of these open protocols to

385
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,119
help you out there?

386
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,729
So one of the things that you've already probably heard about is

387
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,849
MCP. MCP allows you to

388
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:37,009
securely access external data and

389
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,349
tools through a common interface.

390
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,359
Um,

391
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,119
so there are two connection points to, you know, MCP

392
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,479
within, uh, Asian core. One, if

393
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,519
you host your own MCP servers or you

394
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,639
have the code for your MCP servers, you can

395
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,658
host that on runtime with no changes in code

396
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,219
and literally no changes in code.

397
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,109
Uh, if you have external APIs or

398
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:57,678
Smithy models that connect to internal AWS,

399
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,119
uh, tools, or even API gateway

400
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,058
setup that you want to connect and MCP file.

401
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,649
You can use Gateway for that. So Asian Core Gateway

402
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,308
helps you

403
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,769
create an MCP interface to all of your

404
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,808
existing APIs. So there's two ways you can

405
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,849
take Asian core components and then connect

406
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:12,969
it back to MCP.

407
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,918
So that's from your agent to tools, right?

408
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,168
So what about agent to agent? So as, as

409
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,750
the name suggests, A2A is

410
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,558
standard, standardizing the interface when you want agents

411
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:24,690
to talk to each other, right? So it was originally developed

412
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,690
by uh Google,

413
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,450
but then it was uh donated to the Linux Foundation

414
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,129
soon after.

415
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:31,489
Uh, so agents may be built

416
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:33,570
with different frameworks, different languages, different

417
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,729
models, and might be coming in from different

418
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:36,629
providers as well.

419
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,340
Uh, but you still want them to talk to each other, uh,

420
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,210
you know, natively.

421
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,759
And so on the right we're just showing an example

422
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,580
of uh

423
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,190
three different agents talking to each other with uh

424
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,418
with uh 82A

425
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,940
since 82A is a native protocol

426
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,298
like MCP that's supported in runtime. Once

427
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:53,000
again you don't have to,

428
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,658
don't have to do any changes in code and you can

429
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:57,219
directly host your 82A servers.

430
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,619
Uh, you can have an 82A client similar to

431
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:02,048
an MCP client connect to these 82A

432
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,099
servers to test it out as well.

433
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,369
So great. So now we're gonna change that little architecture

434
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:07,139
diagon a little bit.

435
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,840
So you have a customer service agent

436
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,109
that's connected through the blue line, which is A2A

437
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,500
to another uh Landgraf's technical

438
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,969
support agent. The red lines are now MCP,

439
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,450
so that's a standard interface to go from

440
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,649
the strands agent to an auto management API,

441
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:24,048
which is, by the way, an internal AWS

442
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,369
setup that you have. It also has another connection

443
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,229
to an external shipping provider API.

444
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,950
So gateway, for example, if you have an open

445
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,969
API spec for your internal, uh, for

446
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,129
your external shipping provider API, you can import

447
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:35,710
that into

448
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,080
an MCP, um, MCP gateway.

449
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,460
Uh, what we also have is deeper

450
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,239
open source integrations into,

451
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,779
uh, some of these agent core components from

452
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,538
the frameworks itself.

453
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,219
So we're constantly, you know, uh, pumping back

454
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:50,899
some of this

455
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,250
development back into the open source frameworks.

456
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,580
One of the things that you can do, you can, you can have the

457
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,558
stands, uh,

458
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,080
a customer service agent

459
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:00,580
use the built-in session manager, and

460
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,849
you can add agent core memory to it. So both short-term

461
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:04,979
memory, which is STM on the slide there, and

462
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,359
then long term memory as well.

463
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,359
Um, similarly, in, in Landgraph,

464
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
we have some deep integrations as well. So you

465
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,580
can use, uh, what's called Asian core memory

466
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,599
Saver, and what that does is you can save

467
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,678
and load your checkpoints, and checkpoints

468
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,080
store information like your user AI

469
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,119
conversation or your graph execution state, and

470
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,700
that can be,

471
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:25,000
you know, loaded onto memory, and then once

472
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,320
you restart your applications your gentic container,

473
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,639
you can rehydrate the container and restart where you

474
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,288
left off. So

475
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,288
we're excited to continue our partnership

476
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,798
with, you know, Landgraf and Langchain and, uh,

477
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:38,450
all of us, you know,

478
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,808
our examples are based on some of these open

479
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:41,690
source frameworks.

480
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,090
Uh, for Landgraph specifically, we

481
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,219
do this via the Lang chain AWS library,

482
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,009
so you can pip install lang chain AWS.

483
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,840
This gives you all of the, you know, AWS Landgraph

484
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,590
superpowers,

485
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,129
uh, like the one we saw earlier for the, for

486
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,788
the memory checkpointing, for example.

487
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,509
Um, with strands, of course this is

488
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,599
our own homegrown, uh,

489
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:01,418
agent SDK,

490
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,029
but it also has 4000 stars and

491
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,890
a million downloads, and it's growing,

492
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,989
uh, you know,

493
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,390
definitely check it out if you haven't already. It's

494
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,549
easy to get started with and we have a bunch of

495
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:12,068
examples.

496
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,588
Uh, we are the primary maintainers of strands, but

497
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,608
then it's a completely open source project.

498
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,410
Um, lastly, the way we

499
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,868
collaborate with some other frameworks like Crew AI

500
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:24,009
is that we help make direct contributions

501
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,640
to their, um, to their repositories

502
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,729
themselves. So Aris actually has a blog up

503
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:29,368
there, uh,

504
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:31,809
uh, where you can scan and take a look at that. It's

505
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,019
to build Asian systems with Crew AI and, and

506
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:34,930
Amazon Bedrock,

507
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,439
uh, separately, I helped Lama Index, you know,

508
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,650
uh, with their RAG implementations and

509
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,199
also integrations into Asian core.

510
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,680
So we're happily continuing to do this,

511
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,750
um, over and over again. So let's get back

512
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,799
to our. Application at the end.

513
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,019
So now you have,

514
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:49,900
um,

515
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,199
uh, you know, agent core runtime that

516
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,199
is used to run your customer service agent

517
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,180
and your Landgraf technical support agent.

518
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,459
Um, you have, um,

519
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,868
A2A being the interface between those two agents,

520
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,229
right? Uh, then you have, uh,

521
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,250
memory resources that are attached to each agent.

522
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
There's also another alternative. You could have the

523
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,789
two agents have a common memory resource as well if

524
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,818
that's, that's the way an application is set up,

525
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:15,380
but in this case, imagine you have two separate

526
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,479
memory resources for uh this,

527
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,989
the customer support agent and the uh technical

528
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,348
support agent, and then finally you have a gateway

529
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:23,959
that connects to the external tools as well.

530
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:27,170
With that, we'll have Iris come up and, uh,

531
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:27,910
talk about

532
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,719
how engineering teams are transitioning from traditional

533
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,568
DevOps to what we're calling agent ops,

534
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,189
Iris. Thanks,

535
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:37,279
Treyus. So, now that we have

536
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,559
learned how we can build powerful agents

537
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,078
with

538
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,880
AWS services like Agent Core and

539
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,818
the Open Source.

540
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,739
And about the powerful integrations between these

541
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,900
two, we wanna take it one step further and think

542
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,000
about how we can put that into production

543
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,739
with operational excellence, obviously, right?

544
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,459
So in the next 20 minutes, I wanna talk about

545
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,618
uh uh a couple of

546
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:00,660
things that we have worked on in, in the last

547
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,779
months, together with some major players in the open

548
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,239
source space uh here as well.

549
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,239
And um I wanna start with

550
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:07,799
uh

551
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,608
operational excellence. If you think about operational

552
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,299
excellence in traditional software engineering,

553
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,199
probably everyone would say DevOps is really a thing here,

554
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,439
right? And we would probably also

555
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,719
agree that DevOps is not one dimensional.

556
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,799
DevOps has a lot of different dimensions

557
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,699
that we really wanna get right if

558
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,818
we wanna be good in, in, in that field.

559
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,519
Starting from infrastructure, we need to manage

560
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,559
our infrastructure from top to the

561
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,598
bottom. We need to pick the right tools with

562
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:36,699
a lot of automation.

563
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,049
And then we are all people, we are an engineering

564
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:40,699
community,

565
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,318
and we work in processes embracing

566
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,509
a specific culture.

567
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,618
Now, in the first days of DevOps,

568
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:51,160
all of these things were really not easy because

569
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,420
we didn't have, we had a cloud, but we didn't

570
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,078
have a lot of managed services, right?

571
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,130
We didn't have that set of comprehensive

572
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,309
tooling that we have today,

573
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,368
and we hadn't yet agreed on a new

574
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,608
common culture. A lot of the things were still very

575
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,098
waterfall-like, um,

576
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,630
so engineers really had a hard time.

577
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:11,939
But, and we at AWS have pioneered

578
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,140
that in, in the last decade, um, you

579
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,259
know, a lot of organizations out there

580
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,880
and also the open source space

581
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,358
have been inventing a lot of cool things over

582
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:22,410
the past 1015 years here, right?

583
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:24,920
So we at AWS we launched powerful services

584
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,479
like Lambda, like EKS, like S3.

585
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,818
Like CloudWatch, many more services

586
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:32,750
that make all of our lives easier.

587
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,209
We have entire companies that have raced out of

588
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,358
the open source space. If you think about GitHub

589
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:38,348
or Docker.

590
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,670
And then we all as a community have embraced

591
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,500
a new way of doing software engineering

592
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,799
that is super agile with a lot of

593
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,779
automation

594
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:47,818
with

595
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,299
CICD

596
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
which is actually benefiting us uh

597
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,239
a lot, right? So what I wanna talk about

598
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,358
today is how can we take what's working well

599
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,949
in traditional software engineering.

600
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,608
And kind of evolve it into uh

601
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:03,019
the agentic era that is starting now

602
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,000
with all the new functional and non-functional

603
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,039
requirements um that are

604
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:08,759
arising.

605
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,630
And I wanna do that sequentially, one

606
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,920
pillar after the other before bringing it

607
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,959
together at the end.

608
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,299
Starting with infrastructure, as I

609
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,199
said, we have been pioneering that field,

610
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:23,500
um, for traditional software engineering

611
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,809
with services like Lambda, S3,

612
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:26,660
and many more.

613
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,489
And we haven't started reinventing

614
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,818
on your behalf. Um,

615
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,170
Shreas has mentioned a service that we have launched

616
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,689
in July at New York Summit.

617
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,489
Agent Core really specialized, uh,

618
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,650
for agentic workloads.

619
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,170
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time, uh, once

620
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,328
again, you have heard a lot from Shreyas. You have heard probably

621
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,479
a lot about this service in the past days,

622
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:46,750
but

623
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:47,920
It is really

624
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,059
absolutely useful in this specific scenario

625
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,209
because it is a civil service. It

626
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,640
spins up agents quickly.

627
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,019
There's a lot of things that the service is

628
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,519
basically managing uh for you, so

629
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,380
we strongly recommend uh recommend using

630
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,380
a service like Agent Core um and you will

631
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,380
see how you benefit from it down the line

632
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,618
as we go through the other pillars sequentially.

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,789
Moving on to tools, um,

634
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,799
tools is actually a pretty vibrant

635
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,920
space or has been a pretty vibrant space in the last

636
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,059
1 to 3 years.

637
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,358
A lot of stuff that, um, you know,

638
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,578
organizations have built, we have built a lot of tooling,

639
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,640
uh, within Bedrock, but also is Agent

640
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,858
Core if you think about,

641
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,759
um, observability, the, the primitive

642
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,199
or evaluations that we have launched here at Reinvent.

643
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,479
But also the open source space and the startup

644
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,559
space was pretty vibrant, so I

645
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,959
was working with a lot of those startups

646
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,400
across, uh, or alongside the last 1-2

647
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,920
years.

648
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,618
The wide combinator cohorts were full of those,

649
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,979
um, and, uh, you know, a lot of

650
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,939
great tooling has been popping up.

651
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,049
Since this is kind of an ecosystem open source session,

652
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,489
we're gonna focus on that space uh today

653
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:58,108
and um as Treas has already

654
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:00,358
said, um, I'm gonna focus on Langfuse,

655
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,650
which is one of the largest open source uh

656
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,170
uh providers for observability

657
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,809
for, um, you know, agent ops

658
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:08,799
um as well.

659
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:11,309
I've been collaborating strongly with those folks

660
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:13,578
in the last months to develop the approach

661
00:23:13,578 --> 00:23:15,930
that we're gonna be presenting, um, but

662
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,078
again. Whether proprietary

663
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,180
or open source, you can really pick and choose

664
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,459
because everything is built upon open standards.

665
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,289
And if you think about open standards, observability.

666
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,118
Operations,

667
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:29,979
DevOps, agent ops,

668
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,199
really one of the most important here um

669
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,660
is open telemetry.

670
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,000
What is open telemetry? It's not a new

671
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,400
thing. It's been around for years in traditional

672
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,420
software engineering.

673
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,670
Um,

674
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:44,009
but what we have done as community is really we

675
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,049
have further developed it, um, again

676
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,130
to like work with

677
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,250
the new arising functional and non-functional

678
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:50,989
requirements.

679
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,769
It defines a set of semantic conventions,

680
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:55,689
uh, which you can see here on the right side.

681
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,559
So we basically standardize how we are capturing,

682
00:23:58,568 --> 00:23:59,150
um,

683
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,009
the data points, the telemetry

684
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:03,670
in objects.

685
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,439
And then we have also standardized, um,

686
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:07,858
the way how we actually

687
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,259
You know, collect them and ship them into

688
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,858
so-called open telemetry back ends.

689
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:14,118
So the way that works is we all use

690
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,939
these open source frameworks. They are auto instrumented.

691
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,459
That means there is already code in there that is

692
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,598
collecting those metrics automatically for you

693
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,088
if you configure them right.

694
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
There is standardized exporters

695
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,818
that are being built by

696
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,259
organizations or by the open source which are exporting

697
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:31,939
that data,

698
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:34,259
streaming them to the back ends, and these back

699
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:36,358
ends. Can be the platforms we have

700
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,759
talked about. So our, um, you know, observability

701
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,900
platform that is tightly integrated with,

702
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,140
with, uh, with CloudWatch,

703
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,380
um, or a third party

704
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:46,818
open source ones like Langfuse.

705
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,269
Now, I want to spend a minute

706
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,969
speaking about Langfuse to really make sure

707
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,578
we are all on the same page. Um,

708
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,088
what is Langfuse? Uh, it's an open

709
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,189
source LLM engineering platform

710
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,920
uh that is one of those open telemetry back

711
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,709
ends. Um,

712
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,088
this means you can stream your traces.

713
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,078
Your telemetry there is being stored,

714
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,279
and then, uh, on top of that,

715
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:12,000
there's a rich set of features that

716
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:14,430
that you can leverage. So you have core observability.

717
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,949
Um, where you can actually

718
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:19,400
look into in a visual way what's, what's really

719
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,640
happening in your agents.

720
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,650
And then there is a lot of other features as well, like

721
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,309
prompt and data set management,

722
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,318
EAs, experiments, um,

723
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,049
human annotation cues, uh, many more

724
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:31,578
things,

725
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:34,130
and we're gonna use a couple of those, uh, further

726
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:34,769
down the line.

727
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,400
So to come back to the solution architecture that

728
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,828
Rees has been building up um sequentially

729
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,098
in the session, um,

730
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,479
you might recognize we have removed a couple of

731
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,000
components that are not necessarily

732
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,660
crucial for agent ops,

733
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:51,500
but what what we really wanna do is we wanna um

734
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,799
use length fuse, so we need to host it.

735
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,000
It comes, it's open source under MIT license,

736
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,118
so you can just host it in your AWS account

737
00:25:59,118 --> 00:25:59,719
if you want.

738
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:02,439
There's a marketplace offering where you choose

739
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,709
uh the fully managed SARS

740
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,900
version of Langfuse called Langfuse Cloud.

741
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,680
And this is also the one

742
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
that you will find being used in

743
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,809
the code repository we're going to share at the end of

744
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:14,328
this session.

745
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,039
Now you see two black lines here

746
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,299
uh connecting agent core runtime,

747
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:22,880
um, and, and, and length fuse basically.

748
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,180
Um, I wanna focus on the top one,

749
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,279
because this is really the last thing we need

750
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,400
to do before we are up running, up and running.

751
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,709
We need to actually configure

752
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,130
how, how the streaming of the traces

753
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,709
works at the end. Um,

754
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,410
it's not difficult, but it's just a couple

755
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,789
of things we need to configure.

756
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:43,608
We need to set a couple of, or we need

757
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:45,729
to configure a couple of settings, like for

758
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,209
example, which endpoint we're gonna stream our telemetry

759
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:48,969
to, um,

760
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,328
and things like how we're gonna authenticate

761
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:52,449
against length use.

762
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,209
Um, a good way to do that is through setting

763
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,368
environment variables. When we are deploying the agents

764
00:26:57,368 --> 00:26:59,309
in Agent core, you can see that on the right side.

765
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,588
And then on the left side, um, uh,

766
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,130
you know, this is basically a boilerplate

767
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,660
agent implementation and strengths

768
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,890
for agent core

769
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,838
you will, uh, you know, uh,

770
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,328
recognize a couple of things that Treas has

771
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:14,108
shared before.

772
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,088
All we really need to do is, uh, adding

773
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,170
two lines of code. I unfortunately don't

774
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,289
have a pointer here right now, but it's two lines

775
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,868
of code where you are initializing an exporter.

776
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:25,479
And this will, uh,

777
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,000
you know, pull the environment variables in

778
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,150
and then the configuration is being

779
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,939
set up and you will see traces

780
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,559
flowing into length fuse as you're using your

781
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,299
agents.

782
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,039
And this is how it looks like you have

783
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,549
a rich set of information like the time stamps,

784
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,199
the input and output of your agent on a high

785
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,430
level. You can see how many observation

786
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,479
levels um the agent was going

787
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,559
through, so how many turns it was doing till it

788
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,578
solved the problem,

789
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,959
talking counts, latency,

790
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,519
like a lot of information, and then you can also

791
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,118
zoom into the different traces.

792
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,000
With the observation levels on the top left again,

793
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,400
we have a graph execution view can be

794
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
useful for us humans, a visual way to

795
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,299
see complex

796
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,430
executions.

797
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,588
And on the right side you see,

798
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,299
you know, the data points we have collected

799
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:13,459
in the trace

800
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,828
based on the semantic convention we have defined.

801
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,380
All right, so now we've connected

802
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,380
infrastructure and tooling, uh, we know

803
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,390
what's going on.

804
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:27,299
The next question is obviously how can we build

805
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,410
processes around that,

806
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:30,939
that are leveraging this, that

807
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,979
are kind of making our life easier

808
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:33,838
towards production.

809
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:36,118
And

810
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:39,019
we were actually thinking a lot about

811
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:39,608
what

812
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,890
would be a good approach to start together with

813
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,199
the lengthiest folks and.

814
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,368
Uh, we started working backwards

815
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:48,608
from, from DevOps, right? So we were thinking

816
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,719
about what is working good in DevOps,

817
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:52,890
um, and how can we evolve it. And the first thing

818
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,449
we actually realized was

819
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:57,108
a crucial concept in DevOps is testing.

820
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,269
DevOps doesn't work without testing.

821
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,578
And the analogy,

822
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,118
even though it's a bit more complicated

823
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,420
to testing in in Gen AI and agents

824
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,380
is evaluation.

825
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,699
So we were thinking about um

826
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,160
how does evaluation play a crucial role

827
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,630
alongside the entire life cycle of energetic

828
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,539
application. And we found a pretty cool illustration

829
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,420
from from evidently.

830
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,630
That is actually showcasing that. And

831
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,180
uh

832
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:26,160
we, we usually start kind of in a, in a, in a mode

833
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,019
where we are

834
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,449
trying to figure out a good implementation.

835
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,239
So we are changing the code, maybe different frameworks,

836
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:35,039
different models, prompts, sets of tools.

837
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,880
And we want to figure out what works best, so

838
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,959
we are running experiments based on

839
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,660
some data sets that we have put together

840
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:44,430
and we are running EVAs on top of that. It is an

841
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,380
iterative process,

842
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,739
and at some point

843
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,660
we come to or

844
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,180
at some point we basically have a state

845
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,019
that is

846
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,598
as we think, good enough to deploy into production.

847
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,719
We deploy the production, we collect the traces,

848
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:00,410
as we have seen earlier on,

849
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:02,920
and then we enter a kind of a phase of

850
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,068
where we are thriving towards,

851
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,150
first of all, operational excellence.

852
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:07,699
By

853
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,269
moving into a more online way of

854
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:11,618
running EVOs,

855
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:14,420
building dashboards, creating automated alerts,

856
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:15,640
for example, right?

857
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,660
So this is operational excellence.

858
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:19,920
We want our stuff to be running well.

859
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,789
But then we also want to close the loop. We want to

860
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,910
learn from what's happening in production, which means

861
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,449
we can feedback learnings

862
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,219
from production into our test data sets.

863
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,568
If we realize that the

864
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:34,969
data set distribution is not matching

865
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:37,430
the distribution in production in reality,

866
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:40,549
but we can also get inspired by what's happening

867
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:41,430
in production.

868
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:42,769
To

869
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,229
implement new things, right, so whether

870
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:47,459
this is fixing bugs, fixing

871
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,108
issues, or just the next best feature.

872
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,910
All right, so the next step was really, um,

873
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,219
we were thinking about, um, this is a great

874
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,318
theoretical framework, but how can we make that

875
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:58,439
a bit more tangible,

876
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,039
a sequential process, uh, that we can

877
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,140
start also then, uh, uh, or that, that

878
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,759
can get,

879
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,199
that we can also implement later on, right?

880
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,250
And uh what we came up with, with, was

881
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,608
this uh three-stage approach. We

882
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,729
start with an experimentation HPO

883
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:16,049
phase where we wanna try out what's working

884
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,368
well. Then we move further

885
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:20,150
towards production where we have

886
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,059
guard rails to production. Basically,

887
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:25,189
we wanna, we wanna really make sure that everything is

888
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,400
working. So we have a QA

889
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,568
and testing phase and uh we

890
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,549
wanna automate that, we wanna do that

891
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,009
with CICD because that's working really well

892
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,108
in DevOps as well.

893
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,930
And then we go into production,

894
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:39,640
operational excellence, learning from working what's in

895
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,949
production and closing the loop.

896
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Now,

897
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,699
a lot of theory,

898
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,219
going a bit more practical, uh, again,

899
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,799
um, one step deeper,

900
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,680
uh, we have talked about, you know, the process,

901
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,848
the culture that we, that we wanna evolve now. I wanna

902
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:57,039
come back to the infrastructure and tooling

903
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
pillar to speak about how we can actually implement

904
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,809
that. I want to start with infrastructure,

905
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:04,108
then go over to tooling, but before I

906
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:07,328
do that, um, we have two core assumptions

907
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:09,269
that we are building all of that up on.

908
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,979
And the first assumption is

909
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:13,828
really

910
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,449
that we strongly recommend

911
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:18,588
to use a multi-environment setup.

912
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:21,269
Different staging environments, dev, test,

913
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:23,479
prod. It really makes

914
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,519
sense. You don't want to experiment in your

915
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,680
production environment and break the back end of your

916
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,759
production application.

917
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,358
Probably a lot of you have already implemented

918
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:33,680
that. If not, we are strongly recommending

919
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,890
it. And the second thing

920
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,890
is maybe a controversial one for

921
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,969
developers, but we strongly recommend end

922
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:43,049
to end remote cloud-based

923
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,559
development, especially when we have surveless

924
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,449
services at hand.

925
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,439
I know a lot of people like to develop locally,

926
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:51,939
to get started for a POC locally, notebooks

927
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:52,519
maybe,

928
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,140
and this is great, but as you mature in

929
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,170
your work, as you have like a lot of teams

930
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,259
doing that, a lot of use cases,

931
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,969
you reach a point where it actually it doesn't scale

932
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:02,880
anymore. You have

933
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:05,259
MCP tools that are remote that

934
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,338
you're not owning, which you might

935
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:08,559
not be able to access.

936
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:11,489
And you really don't want your developers to

937
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,348
spend weeks of development work

938
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,809
uh just to realize that the

939
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,969
stuff they have built is working on their local machine, but

940
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,289
not in the target environment.

941
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,150
So with those assumptions, uh,

942
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,709
moving further, um, uh,

943
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:27,519
and getting started, uh, to the implementation.

944
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,118
So first phase, uh, experimentation, um,

945
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,328
HPO we wanna figure out what's working well

946
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:34,430
alongside a set of hyperparameters

947
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:35,989
or implementations.

948
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,009
But we don't want to do that by rule of thumb,

949
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,890
just trying

950
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,608
a couple of things out

951
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:44,068
and seeing what works. We want to have solid data

952
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:46,368
points. We want to have a proven methodology.

953
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:47,769
Um,

954
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,660
so what we can do is actually, and

955
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
automation concepts like infrastructure is

956
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,719
code, um, but also

957
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:57,410
the cloud, the fact that you can spin up agents

958
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,618
in a matter of seconds with agent core comes really

959
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:00,459
handy here is

960
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:03,019
you can just go ahead and launch a

961
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:04,318
fleet of agents.

962
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,000
For example, one agent per hyperparameter

963
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,099
combination. This is then a grid search

964
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,519
in hyperparameter optimization.

965
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:13,728
You spin them up, you run your EAs, you

966
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,947
tear them down again, super frugal way,

967
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,039
you get your data points, um,

968
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,407
you have tested out all combinations and you

969
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:21,907
have a solid data

970
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:24,068
uh base basically,

971
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:26,407
uh, that you can ground your decision based

972
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:28,510
on. Then you, then

973
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,648
we move on, um, once we have found

974
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:32,750
the ideal setup, we push this in the

975
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,789
code versioning, repository,

976
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,260
GitHub, code commit,

977
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,708
whatever you want to use,

978
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,329
this triggers an automated CICD

979
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,378
pipeline that is here for QA and

980
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:42,889
testing.

981
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,110
It's going to deploy another ephemeral

982
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,688
agent.

983
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:49,769
Just one agent now. We run our tests,

984
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:51,969
we get the results. If we are below the bar

985
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,188
that we have set, we go back to the first phase.

986
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,750
But let's assume we are good enough,

987
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,199
then we can deploy into production. Now it's a

988
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,668
persistent agent that we want to use

989
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,648
as back end for our

990
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:05,648
production application.

991
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,760
And we close the loop by learning

992
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,579
from from what's happening in production.

993
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:13,389
So this is the infra site.

994
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:16,139
Now how does that look like on

995
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:17,139
the tooling site?

996
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,929
And I want to start with uh

997
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,889
recognizing that all of these three phases,

998
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,989
uh, you know, are based on

999
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,010
the concept of that we have traces

1000
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,070
available, right? Without the traces, we don't

1001
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,929
know what's going on in the agents.

1002
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:33,269
We basically need them. This is kind of the,

1003
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:35,429
the core assumption we are building the

1004
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:35,978
rest upon.

1005
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,179
Now, the first two phases are actually

1006
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,530
pretty similar in a way.

1007
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:43,530
We are running experiments

1008
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,030
of different sizes.

1009
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,789
Uh, based on mainly offline evals with

1010
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:49,878
data sets that we have configured, the main difference

1011
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:52,269
is we might want to use different eAs

1012
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:54,280
because we want to test other

1013
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,579
things in those spaces,

1014
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,039
and then the size of the data sets can vary.

1015
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,219
If you think about it,

1016
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,639
in the first step you have a fleet of agents. If you

1017
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,789
use a huge data set, it gets

1018
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:04,500
expensive.

1019
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,519
Now in the second step, you have only one agent

1020
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,559
to test on, so you can maybe with the same

1021
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,139
budget.

1022
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:11,679
You know, do,

1023
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,340
do some more testing cycles, but this is really a trade-off

1024
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,070
we need

1025
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,059
to think through.

1026
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:18,659
And then in the second phase,

1027
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,398
we are basically um you know transitioning,

1028
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,719
transitioning a bit more into

1029
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,860
an online way of doing eAs, even though

1030
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,289
I think offline eWs is also

1031
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:29,010
possible,

1032
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,760
and we use uh or

1033
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,878
we might want to use a cool feature in length

1034
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:35,918
use, the annotation feature where we can

1035
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:37,978
actually have humans annotate traces

1036
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,159
and feed them back into our data sets.

1037
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,628
So to bring it all together, uh, we have

1038
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,119
talked about uh how to actually evolve

1039
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:47,728
DevOps into something

1040
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:50,628
we might wanna call agent ops, uh, satisfying

1041
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:52,449
your requirements that have been popping up,

1042
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,168
um, with

1043
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,510
powerful services like Agent Core

1044
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,619
that are integrating, uh, with

1045
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,789
third party, um,

1046
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,699
you know, uh, observability agents,

1047
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:04,489
uh, tooling platforms out there,

1048
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,110
um, and we are really flexible because

1049
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,610
they integrate, uh, well.

1050
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,519
And we've also spoken about, you

1051
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,659
know, kind of a new culture with new processes

1052
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,679
that we are proposing here and we

1053
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,739
hope you will all embrace, um, uh,

1054
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,840
in order, um, you know, to have uh a new

1055
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,820
era of,

1056
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,119
uh, successful software engineering

1057
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,438
now here, um, uh in uh the Agentic

1058
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:27,668
space. Now, before

1059
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,840
I, I close it up and hand over to Keith, uh,

1060
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,809
I want to point out that

1061
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,610
we have a couple of resources for you.

1062
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,320
We have actually really built that. Um, there

1063
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,228
is a code repository that you can

1064
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,829
fork and use as a starting point,

1065
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,329
uh, within your orc. There's gonna be some things

1066
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,079
that will be different to your orcs,

1067
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,429
but I think it's a pretty good starting point.

1068
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:50,110
And then if you wanna dive deeper than what I

1069
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,349
could do now in 20 minutes, uh, you might wanna

1070
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,429
check out the YouTube video here on the

1071
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:55,949
right side. It's a deep dive

1072
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,550
that I've recorded with the CEO of Langfuse

1073
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,570
a couple of weeks ago.

1074
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,039
And with that I wanna hand over to

1075
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,280
Keith who is uh VP engineering at Kuher

1076
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,559
Health and um he's leveraging

1077
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,800
a lot of the things that we have spoken

1078
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,659
about today

1079
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:12,918
uh with uh his teams and in their

1080
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:13,639
day to day work.

1081
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,969
Thanks, thanks Earth.

1082
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,590
So, uh, at Cohere recently had the

1083
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,010
opportunity to, uh, partner with,

1084
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,309
uh, the AWS team on the, the beta

1085
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:28,679
and launch for Asian Core.

1086
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:31,289
Uh, and we built on top of it what we call,

1087
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,599
uh, Review resolve, which is,

1088
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,789
uh, a product that we're using to

1089
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:38,250
help, uh, drive, uh,

1090
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:40,570
improved prior authorization, uh,

1091
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,409
prior, prior authorization processes.

1092
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,789
So

1093
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,219
For those of you who aren't familiar with prior authorization,

1094
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,418
um,

1095
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:50,039
in the US healthcare system, it's common practice

1096
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:50,619
where

1097
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,699
prior to, uh, uh, a clinician

1098
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:54,780
performing a procedure,

1099
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,719
they need to make a request to a health insurance company,

1100
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,860
uh,

1101
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,978
to get, to get that procedure approved.

1102
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,000
And the determination about whether or not that procedure

1103
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
can be approved is dependent

1104
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,519
on a policy.

1105
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:08,958
That policy

1106
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,679
can be defined by the insurance company. You have

1107
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,659
state level policies, you have federal policies.

1108
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,699
In those policies in those policies,

1109
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,559
you've got uh medical necessity guidelines

1110
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,300
that have to be met uh prior to

1111
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,239
uh a a procedure being approved.

1112
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,320
So for example, uh, you might

1113
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,458
have a knee injury, you're talking with your doctor,

1114
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:32,648
and she recommends that you get surgery

1115
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,409
for, uh, uh, for your knee.

1116
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,559
Prior to performing surgery, she would have

1117
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,739
to submit a prior authorization request

1118
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,878
to the healthcare company.

1119
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,139
We would take a look at the policy. The

1120
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:46,188
policy might indicate, for example, as one

1121
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:48,128
part of the medical necessity criteria,

1122
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:51,269
you know, prior to, uh, knee surgery,

1123
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,889
more conservative therapy has to have been,

1124
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:55,289
uh, uh,

1125
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,039
Uh, attempted like physical therapy, for

1126
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,079
example, over 2

1127
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,199
months before you can get approval for,

1128
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,329
uh, for knee surgery.

1129
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,889
So that, that, that example is like

1130
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:09,208
sort of a very uh kind of straightforward

1131
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,648
one. The reality is that the prior authorization

1132
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:13,769
process, uh, is a very

1133
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,849
complex one, in healthcare in

1134
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:16,389
America.

1135
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:17,469
Um,

1136
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,659
It has an estimated cost of

1137
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:24,000
about $35 billion annually.

1138
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,699
It creates an enormous amount of administrative overhead

1139
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:27,688
for clinicians,

1140
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:29,769
which reduces their time with patients.

1141
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:31,938
Uh, it also affects

1142
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,860
the timeliness with the patients get the

1143
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,119
appropriate treatment that they need.

1144
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,769
So at Cohere, uh, we're really focused

1145
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,769
on helping uh clinicians and

1146
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,869
patients get to ES faster.

1147
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:47,199
And we do a lot of

1148
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,360
uh auto decisioning, so based on the

1149
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,409
information that we receive in a prior authorization

1150
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:51,918
request,

1151
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,739
the clinical information that we have about a patient,

1152
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:57,639
uh, and the policy that we're examining,

1153
00:40:57,898 --> 00:41:01,360
uh, in some cases we can get up to 85%

1154
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,500
auto approval rates.

1155
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,949
However, in that 15%, uh,

1156
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:09,148
it needs to go to a clinic to a clinician

1157
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:09,769
for review.

1158
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:13,050
Uh, we don't use machine learning, uh,

1159
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,159
or AI to ever,

1160
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:16,610
uh, deny deny deny a claim

1161
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,559
or deny a prior authorization request.

1162
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,688
But what we do use, uh, AI and

1163
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,708
agents is to help surface,

1164
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:26,228
uh, clinical information in that,

1165
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,349
uh, review, in that review process.

1166
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,418
For the clinician to help them figure out

1167
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:33,820
uh whether or not medical necessity guidelines

1168
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,889
are being met and that procedure can be approved

1169
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:36,438
or not.

1170
00:41:38,898 --> 00:41:40,329
This results in an

1171
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,909
uptick in like 30 to 40% faster

1172
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:45,269
reviews uh for uh clinicians,

1173
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:47,389
doctors and nurses who are interacting with

1174
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:48,489
our review tools,

1175
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:50,090
uh, to

1176
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,128
make a determination on prior authorization cases.

1177
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,250
So I'm gonna talk a little bit just about like the problem

1178
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,320
space here, uh, and some of the issues

1179
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,559
that we're solving with agents.

1180
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:03,208
Uh, so I think,

1181
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,590
you know, typically if you're working, uh, with agents

1182
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,708
or language models, you're doing some

1183
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,340
sort of

1184
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:11,110
optimization between like latency

1185
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,010
cost and

1186
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:13,829
some accuracy measure.

1187
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:15,070
Uh,

1188
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,590
in this case for us, uh, latency and

1189
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,688
cost aren't the primary factors, uh,

1190
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:21,530
precision and accuracy are paramount.

1191
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,610
We're making decisions that, uh,

1192
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:26,809
our, our clinicians are making decisions that determine

1193
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,989
whether or not a patient gets the appropriate care.

1194
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,159
We're looking through potentially,

1195
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,648
you know, huge amounts of data,

1196
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:36,168
uh, for very precise, uh,

1197
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,329
uh, information.

1198
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:42,219
The language here, uh, is like

1199
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,360
complex and specialized. Frontier languages, uh, frontier

1200
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,429
models, state of the art models, uh, do a

1201
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:47,449
reasonably good job

1202
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:49,769
of, uh, picking up on some of this.

1203
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:52,708
Uh, but there are like some, some complex problems

1204
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:53,489
here, so,

1205
00:42:53,898 --> 00:42:54,789
uh,

1206
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,949
Like lower back pain as an example.

1207
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,329
Uh, that might be expressed as lower back

1208
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,478
pain, low back pain, pain in the lower back,

1209
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,648
uh, LBP, and

1210
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,938
You know, everyone who's worked with language models or NLP

1211
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:09,918
is thinking like, well, you know, that's,

1212
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:12,550
you know, that's a problem that's, you know, fairly easily

1213
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,159
solved,

1214
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:15,978
uh, to, you know, to sort of semantically

1215
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:16,519
group those.

1216
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:19,500
Uh, the problem though is that,

1217
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,360
uh,

1218
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,708
In order for you to, uh,

1219
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,449
to do that in a way that's effective,

1220
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,769
it needs to use like the same ontology

1221
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:28,800
and taxonomy

1222
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,179
that the policy is using, right? So

1223
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,199
term normalization, concept resolution,

1224
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,239
uh, match up to the language and the policy.

1225
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:39,239
Or you're taking the policy and your clinical

1226
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:41,369
information, and a third ontology

1227
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,539
and mapping, uh, and taxonomy and mapping

1228
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:44,199
everything to that.

1229
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:46,849
So this is a very, uh,

1230
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:49,750
complex space where, uh, just out

1231
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,050
of the box language models aren't able to handle,

1232
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,128
uh, uh, a number of these problems.

1233
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,869
Uh, agent management is also complex,

1234
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:00,228
so we're dealing with both, um,

1235
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,179
structured and unstructured data.

1236
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,610
So structured data might be, uh, claims history,

1237
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,418
for example,

1238
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,398
uh, unstructured data could be, uh,

1239
00:44:08,418 --> 00:44:09,728
you know, clinical records.

1240
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:12,500
There can be an enormous amount, uh, of either of

1241
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,199
those two.

1242
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,449
And I think that if you've done a lot of work with

1243
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:18,619
language models at this point, um,

1244
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,219
I think sort of intuitively like

1245
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:24,280
based on, you know, precision and accuracy,

1246
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:25,519
uh,

1247
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,398
You can sort of see that something like uh traditional

1248
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:29,679
like uh

1249
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,599
uh vector rag search, uh, similarity

1250
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,438
search isn't gonna be particularly useful here.

1251
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,019
There, there are some times when it sometimes

1252
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,119
when it is useful, but you're not looking for something

1253
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,139
similar, you're looking for something that like is a

1254
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:42,619
a very precise match.

1255
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,579
So we need to do a lot of in context,

1256
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:48,019
uh, learning with our models. So passing

1257
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,739
the structure and the structured data in.

1258
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:52,699
We also need different representations of the data.

1259
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:53,659
So, you know,

1260
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:56,340
combining the structured unstructured data into,

1261
00:44:56,378 --> 00:44:58,599
say, uh, a graph representation,

1262
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:01,079
uh, you know, and

1263
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:01,969
giving the agent

1264
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,019
options for, you know,

1265
00:45:04,378 --> 00:45:05,958
uh, how it might want to,

1266
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:08,539
uh, you know, fetch that data to reason

1267
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,840
over, uh, is, is critical.

1268
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:15,050
There's also like an important like temporal component

1269
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,409
here. So, you know, I mentioned previously

1270
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:19,559
for the knee surgery, conservative therapy,

1271
00:45:19,938 --> 00:45:22,010
you need to look at potentially clinical

1272
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,708
data or or claims

1273
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,250
uh to see if, you know, hey, over the last two months,

1274
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,478
has a patient undergone uh

1275
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,188
uh physical therapy.

1276
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,090
Uh, you might be looking at blood values over time,

1277
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:35,489
you might be looking at very specific, very

1278
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,708
specific dosing information over a time window.

1279
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:40,418
Uh, and that kind of temporal data,

1280
00:45:40,628 --> 00:45:42,639
uh, retrieval is something that language models typically

1281
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,739
don't handle very well.

1282
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,610
There's also like a, a context window management problem

1283
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,148
here. Uh, you can easily overflow,

1284
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,579
uh, uh, a context window with

1285
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:53,949
claims and, uh,

1286
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,300
uh, clinical data.

1287
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,010
So how do you narrow down what it is you're looking

1288
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,179
for, what kind of heuristics can you use to,

1289
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,719
uh, determine, you know, what you pass to the model in

1290
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:03,708
con in context.

1291
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:05,570
And then,

1292
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,070
you know, the scope of your evaluations here

1293
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,090
expands rapidly. Um,

1294
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,619
you're dealing with different data representations, you're dealing

1295
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:13,500
with a lot of data,

1296
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,869
you need a lot of, uh, you know, ground

1297
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:18,148
truth data to, uh, run your evals against.

1298
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,489
This is a very, uh, uh,

1299
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,570
you know, the, the complexity here grows rapidly.

1300
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:27,309
So I did want to talk, obviously

1301
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:29,469
this is an Asian core session, like why we're using Asian

1302
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:30,208
core. So,

1303
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,909
uh, as you know, sure and Iris

1304
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:35,110
have talked about, you know, bring your own tooling is

1305
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,958
a sort of a key principle here.

1306
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:39,590
We were already in like the Lang graph and Lang

1307
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,750
fuse, uh, sorry, Lang graph and Lang chain,

1308
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,809
uh, ecosystem.

1309
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,369
Uh, so we were able to, you know, fairly quickly,

1310
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:48,070
uh, move out of uh

1311
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,648
ECS into Asian core.

1312
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,070
Uh, we're,

1313
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:53,449
uh, we're using AIS, uh,

1314
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,989
for telemetry, for, uh, observability.

1315
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:57,418
Uh

1316
00:46:58,389 --> 00:47:00,449
Uh, Iris was just talking about Lang fuse, which

1317
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:02,610
is great. Uh, Arise has,

1318
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,938
uh, an open source product called Phoenix, which is

1319
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:05,579
also great.

1320
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:08,300
We do use Arise's Enterprise, uh,

1321
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:10,050
edition, uh, Arise DX,

1322
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:10,949
uh,

1323
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,269
but it's, it's a great, their open source Phoenix is a

1324
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:15,148
great point of comparison against, uh,

1325
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:16,389
uh,

1326
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:17,469
uh, Langfuse.

1327
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,099
Uh, and we also use light LLM for,

1328
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:22,398
uh, an LLM gateway. I'm not sure how many people

1329
00:47:22,398 --> 00:47:23,938
here are using LLM gateways,

1330
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,360
uh, and I'll talk about it a little

1331
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,340
bit on the next slide.

1332
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,300
And then, you know, something that really appeals to us as a startup

1333
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,320
is, you know, the minimal, which is

1334
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,820
no infrastructure management here.

1335
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,438
Uh, and anytime my team's not managing

1336
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,559
hardware or infrastructure, they're focused on product

1337
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:42,289
development. We're in a regulated

1338
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:44,398
industry, the, uh, micro VM

1339
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:46,840
architecture, you know, fast spin up spin down,

1340
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,909
no red memory is important for us.

1341
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,309
Uh,

1342
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:53,039
Trey has brought up the CLI that fits really neatly

1343
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,378
into our existing CICD pipelines,

1344
00:47:55,728 --> 00:47:57,809
and Otel works really well, like

1345
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:00,039
I said, uh, to hydrate, uh,

1346
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:00,659
Arise.

1347
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:03,570
All of this works like pretty seamlessly out of the box

1348
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,039
with minimal code changes.

1349
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,070
Two things that are really important for us, uh,

1350
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:11,398
is agent core gateway and governance

1351
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:13,639
and security, and they're, I see them as very tied

1352
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,699
together. Uh,

1353
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,639
let's say that we have, uh, a specialized subagent

1354
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,978
that is, uh,

1355
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,659
uh, a claims related subagent, so it's able

1356
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:24,679
to, you know, pull claims for a patient

1357
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:25,688
and, uh,

1358
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,099
uh, search for data and and claim history.

1359
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,128
Um, and we might have an API that

1360
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:33,128
we have internally that allows you,

1361
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:35,510
has different endpoints to interact with claim

1362
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,369
information. What's,

1363
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,668
what's nice is we can put agent code gateway in front of it, but

1364
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,949
what's critical is that from like not just a security

1365
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:43,949
by design perspective, but compliance

1366
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:44,769
by design.

1367
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,050
We need to know, OK, like who's interacting

1368
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,070
with the main agent in a review session.

1369
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,050
If there's a call to a sub-agent

1370
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,329
to look at claims data,

1371
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:56,769
what's the identity of that user who made that

1372
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,570
claim, who made that call to the subagent?

1373
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:00,869
What are they authorized to see, and can we

1374
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:02,889
ensure that they only retrieve information for

1375
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:05,110
a patient that they have access to?

1376
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:07,989
This is critical for compliance and,

1377
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,668
uh, compliance and audit.

1378
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:14,378
Uh, Stras also mentioned, um,

1379
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,039
uh, short and long term memory.

1380
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,958
Uh, so short term memory supports,

1381
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:20,659
uh, text and binary data.

1382
00:49:20,978 --> 00:49:23,378
Uh, uh, he mentioned Lagraph checkpointing

1383
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,378
which needs to use, uh, binary data,

1384
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,820
it's very straightforward plug-in from the AWS team

1385
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,760
to drop into,

1386
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,800
uh, La graph to, uh,

1387
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,760
uh, get short term memory storage.

1388
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,809
Long term memory, uh, is more complicated,

1389
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,849
I think, regardless of the framework you're using.

1390
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:41,570
Um, one thing that we found useful is name

1391
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,728
spaces for managing, uh,

1392
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,228
like a multi-tenant environment.

1393
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:46,309
Uh,

1394
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:48,969
you need to spend some time thinking about your memory architecture

1395
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:51,128
here. This is, uh, I'd say

1396
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:53,250
significantly more complex than, uh,

1397
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:55,949
uh, short term memory, especially if you have multiple agents.

1398
00:49:58,978 --> 00:50:01,179
So I'm gonna just talk about our architecture

1399
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:03,300
a bit here and it, it is, uh, yeah,

1400
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,099
I wish I had a, a pointer.

1401
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:06,039
Um,

1402
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,619
uh, it looks busy but it's actually like the

1403
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:09,789
complexity of it, uh,

1404
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:11,679
uh, is reduced. I'm only showing one,

1405
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:13,780
agent, uh, which is in the

1406
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:16,610
review all platform and like just in

1407
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,619
the middle it shows the uh chatbot

1408
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:19,320
supervisor.

1409
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,648
So that's, uh, you know, that's running in line graph,

1410
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,478
um,

1411
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,570
and we're connecting, uh, to Agent Core

1412
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,389
short memory there.

1413
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:30,019
Uh, like I said, very seamless, uh,

1414
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,010
integration

1415
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:34,208
within, uh, the chatbot itself is or

1416
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,610
this particular agent is running on,

1417
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,949
uh, Agent Core infrastructure on the micro

1418
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:39,510
VM.

1419
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:42,780
All of our traffic is running through Light

1420
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,898
LLM, uh, to Bedrock.

1421
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:47,639
So Light LLM is an AI gateway.

1422
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:50,340
Uh, if you haven't worked with one of these, it functions

1423
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,699
as sort of, uh, like a reverse

1424
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:53,760
proxy for,

1425
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,599
uh, talking to different, uh, model providers.

1426
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:59,360
Uh, it gives you really nice features like,

1427
00:50:59,378 --> 00:51:01,458
uh, uh, rate limiting,

1428
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,019
uh, insight onto like token usage by user,

1429
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:06,168
uh, cost controls, you can put common

1430
00:51:06,168 --> 00:51:07,320
guard rails in place.

1431
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,938
We're mostly working with Bedrock, but it's

1432
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,579
seamless for us to pull in Gemini,

1433
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:14,119
anything from OpenAI,

1434
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:16,159
uh, behind Light LLM,

1435
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,019
and if a client in front of Light LLM

1436
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:20,079
wants to use those,

1437
00:51:20,898 --> 00:51:22,969
you're really just changing an API key in the

1438
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:24,719
name of a model. Uh, all the other,

1439
00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:27,958
uh, work is being handled via, via the gateway.

1440
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,719
You can see on the left, we're using uh Arise

1441
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:33,820
uh prompt management.

1442
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,519
So So.

1443
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,929
I'll talk about emails, uh, in a minute,

1444
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:43,869
um.

1445
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,708
For us, uh,

1446
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:50,739
we, we tend to separate our prompts

1447
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:52,769
from, uh, like our application codes

1448
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:55,050
so that we have a life cycle and a deployment

1449
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,369
life cycle, a life cycle

1450
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,559
A life cycle and a deployment life cycle for

1451
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,228
prompts that separate from code.

1452
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:04,079
You can make updates to prompts without having to redeploy,

1453
00:52:04,228 --> 00:52:05,619
uh, redeploy containers.

1454
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:08,769
Um, at the bottom you can see, uh,

1455
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,719
indication level,

1456
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,079
uh, LLM prompt in the lower left there.

1457
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,228
So, thinking about that claims

1458
00:52:15,228 --> 00:52:16,329
agent for a moment,

1459
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:19,070
uh, you might have this uh

1460
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,090
supervisor agent,

1461
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,668
and, uh, that's what

1462
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:24,668
the, the, the doctor or the nurse is interacting

1463
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:27,030
with. And you might make a

1464
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,110
call to a specialized sub-agent for

1465
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:29,739
claims.

1466
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:33,349
Something that I feel like we, we talk about a lot when we're

1467
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:35,530
talking about MCP is, uh, is tools.

1468
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:37,949
I think how we use prompts

1469
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:39,659
in MCP is really interesting.

1470
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,949
I don't see it like as much about it, maybe I'm

1471
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:44,168
reading the wrong, uh, the wrong authors.

1472
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,239
But in this case, you know, you could pass

1473
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,039
the uh medical necessity criteria

1474
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,418
uh to that claims agent.

1475
00:52:51,938 --> 00:52:54,079
It could decide what, uh,

1476
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,219
you know, claim history it wants to grab, and also

1477
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,929
select what is the

1478
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,418
medical necessity criteria or the indication

1479
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:02,139
level is the terminology we'd use.

1480
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:03,840
What prompt do I wanna grab,

1481
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:06,688
uh, in order to, uh, look for this

1482
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:08,719
information, uh, in, in the claim history.

1483
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:10,378
Um,

1484
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,418
this is a, so there's multiple ways we handle,

1485
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,619
uh, clinical data extraction including like with,

1486
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:17,349
uh, fine-tuned models.

1487
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,780
Uh, but this is like particularly interesting,

1488
00:53:19,878 --> 00:53:22,039
and it's also adds to the complexity

1489
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,179
of your evals.

1490
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:24,300
Uh,

1491
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:26,398
it's a powerful methodology, but

1492
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,878
as your clinical areas grow, as the number of

1493
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:30,019
prompts you have grow,

1494
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:31,019
Um,

1495
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:33,369
being able to, you know, evaluate whether or

1496
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:35,369
not you retrieved the right prompt and applied

1497
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:37,478
it in the right way for that subagent against that

1498
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:39,469
data to get the information you're looking for

1499
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,969
becomes another set of evaluations

1500
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:42,699
you have to run.

1501
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:44,539
Uh,

1502
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,978
the announcement of session level evals, uh, is

1503
00:53:46,978 --> 00:53:47,599
really exciting,

1504
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:49,619
being able to run evals across, like,

1505
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:52,139
you know, the whole, uh, the whole set of agentic

1506
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,260
interactions, uh, is, is really

1507
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,840
critical.

1508
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,809
And then, uh, I'm just gonna touch on,

1509
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,369
uh, evals here briefly. Uh,

1510
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,648
it's my, my slide here is much busier than

1511
00:54:05,648 --> 00:54:06,369
Iris's.

1512
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:08,989
So like I mentioned, uh, earlier, we're

1513
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:11,208
already in, uh, the Arise ecosystem.

1514
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:12,418
Uh,

1515
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,188
we have online evals, so

1516
00:54:15,188 --> 00:54:17,469
you know, from, uh, from

1517
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:19,550
Lang Langgraph and Agent Core, we have data going

1518
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,469
into Arise.

1519
00:54:20,978 --> 00:54:23,179
Uh, that can get piped into our

1520
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:25,219
online e e evaluation. We could

1521
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:26,639
have a L as a judge there,

1522
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:29,679
looking at things like ha hallucination rate,

1523
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,389
uh,

1524
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:32,860
we could be looking at guideline, uh, guardrail

1525
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,898
violations, there's like a number of things that you

1526
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,239
might wanna, uh, be looking at for,

1527
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,599
uh, online evals.

1528
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:41,458
And especially like if you wanted to determine

1529
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:43,639
if, you know, performance is changing in any way.

1530
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:47,309
Uh, we also hook into our offline

1531
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:49,750
evals here. Um, so,

1532
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:52,469
uh, we are, we have clinicians on

1533
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:53,668
staff, doctors, nurses,

1534
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:54,989
subject matter experts,

1535
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,579
so we're able to, uh, have, uh,

1536
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,989
human annotators, uh, in the loop here,

1537
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:02,628
uh, and that can all be fed into

1538
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:05,019
our, uh, offline, uh,

1539
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,128
uh,

1540
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:08,978
evals process where we're, you know, uh,

1541
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:12,469
You know, determining the the effectiveness

1542
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:14,889
of a particular prompt, of a fine-tuned,

1543
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:16,530
uh, small language model,

1544
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:19,128
uh, of the agentic system

1545
00:55:19,128 --> 00:55:21,489
or the set of agentic calls, uh,

1546
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,050
as a whole.

1547
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,110
Uh, and just like with Langfuse,

1548
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:26,949
like we already had something like this,

1549
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:28,168
we're able to

1550
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:31,019
keep this mostly working as is, uh,

1551
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,289
and, uh, plug it into Asian core,

1552
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,510
uh, and get all this data hydrated the way that we

1553
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,369
needed it to.

1554
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:38,090
Um

1555
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:41,360
That's uh, that's uh it for me. I'm gonna hand it back

1556
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,978
to Shreyas.

1557
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:45,599
Thank you Keith and uh

1558
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:48,539
uh you know in summary what we saw

1559
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:50,539
is we saw Asian core uh that

1560
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:53,639
can integrate with multiple open source uh

1561
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,769
uh frameworks as well as protocols.

1562
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:58,219
uh Aris walked us through Asian tops

1563
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:00,260
as well as uh a deeper integration

1564
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,340
with Lang fuse and we saw a really exciting

1565
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,340
real world uh application with, uh,

1566
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:05,219
coherent Health as well.

1567
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,659
I'm gonna leave this slide up there for, for,

1568
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,139
uh, for you to scan. I know folks

1569
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:12,139
are trying to hurry up and scan quickly when

1570
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,320
we change. So thank you so much for

1571
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,458
attending our session and I hope

1572
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,739
you found this informative.

1573
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:20,179
Uh, we're gonna hang out here, uh, for

1574
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:22,199
a little bit to take any questions later on.

1575
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:23,139
Thank you so much.
