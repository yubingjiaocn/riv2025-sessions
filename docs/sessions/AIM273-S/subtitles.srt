1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,520
- All right, good morning.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,440
Thank you all for joining the session.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,660
I'm Lakshman, a partner in PWC.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,870
I manage our tech and analytics
for financial services.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm really excited to
have Matt and Solomon,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,170
the risk technology leadership
of Capital One, join us.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,900
Matt is the managing vice
president of product.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,120
He focuses on their product strategy.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,380
And then we have Solomon,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,720
who's the vice president
of software engineering.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,690
He focuses on like
architecture implementation

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,333
and building the risk
positioning platform.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,770
Now, I wrote the business
case for this session,

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,540
and part of the reason was because I work

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,090
with a lot of other financial
services institutions.

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,370
Almost everyone chose to
buy a vendor solution.

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,150
There are a number of solutions
available in this space.

18
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,870
Capital One had the
forethought back in like 2019

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,660
to build something natively in AWS.

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,450
Now, it's become more obvious

21
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,110
because of the capabilities
of AWS has evolved so much.

22
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,700
And then some of the vendor solutions

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,380
are pretty restrictive,

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,420
but we are seeing the
benefits of that decision.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,020
So I thought we'll get them on the stage,

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,900
have them speak about the process

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,190
in which they went through.

28
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,420
I have some questions prepared.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,650
I'm gonna go through the questions,

30
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,300
and towards the end we'll open up for QA.

31
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,300
So feel free to ask any
questions in the end.

32
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,020
I'll start with the first question,

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,670
and then, Matt and Solomon, feel free

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,410
to introduce yourself as we get started.

35
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,010
The first question is,
Capital One is often described

36
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,580
as a software company
that happens to be a bank.

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,120
How does that philosophy
show up in your approach

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,830
to governance, risk, and compliance?

39
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,420
Start with you, Matt.

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,500
- Sounds good.

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,710
So as Lakshman said, I am
head of product management

42
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,570
for risk management at Capital One,

43
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,550
so responsible for all the software

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,610
that we build that
Capital One associates use

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,530
to manage risks ranging from things

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,230
like investigating money laundering

47
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,073
to investigate it or to
managing issues and events.

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,230
And when I think about your
question here, you know,

49
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,540
as you said, Capital One
is a technology company.

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,430
We happen to be a technology company

51
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,770
in the financial services space.

52
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,110
And we say, you know, as a bank,

53
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,750
risk management is our business.

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,520
And we put those things together.

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,750
You know, one of the things Solomon

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,310
and I really focus on is like,

57
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,550
how can we transform risk
management with technology?

58
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,740
And I think that's how
you get that alignment

59
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,920
with the business and aligning risk,

60
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,460
technology, compliance going forward.

61
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,070
And yeah.

62
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,600
- Solomon, anything you wanna add to that?

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,460
- Yes, thanks for having us.

64
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,590
Like Lakshman said, I'm in Capital One.

65
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,423
I've been with Capital one 14 years.

66
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm in the engineering
space building software,

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,730
in the risk space for
the last five, six years.

68
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,830
It's been pretty exciting.

69
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,470
To answer, you know,
to the question itself,

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,250
if you think about how at Capital One

71
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,740
we look to solve problems
for our business,

72
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,180
it's fundamentally changed

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,720
since we've become a cloud-native company.

74
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,820
So while we've started to change our ways

75
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
to approaching how we build software

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,440
and solving business,

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,990
the GRC problem comes
along a few years ago,

78
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,040
and then it was no different

79
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,420
when we looked at it and said,

80
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,120
is this a competitive
advantage and can we do it?

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,730
And I think because of
the journey we've been on

82
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,250
on our AWS journey and, you know,

83
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,280
the evolution of risk management,

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,560
the confluence allowed
us to, I think, you know,

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,600
start this GRC journey ourselves.

86
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,130
- Thank you.

87
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,900
Matt, next question for you.

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,360
I wanna talk about the initial vision.

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,770
What is the North Star

90
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,710
when you started building this platform?

91
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,230
- Yeah, our overarching goal

92
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,320
is to build real-time
intelligent risk management.

93
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,000
And I think a lot of risk management work

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,071
in practice ends up
being documenting things

95
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:54,060
that have happened, but
we want to have a platform

96
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,960
that really helps people to
proactively manage risks,

97
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,420
anticipate things before they occur,

98
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,450
minimize the impacts of
things that do occur.

99
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,530
And I think if we really focus

100
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,720
on this theme of real-time intelligent,

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,540
one, we'll deliver way
better user experiences

102
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,430
to all those people around Capital One

103
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,080
that are using our software,

104
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,490
and, two, deliver way
better risk management

105
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,660
for the business.

106
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,750
- Yeah, I remember like
working with you back in 2019

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,250
when none of the other banks,

108
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,570
or at least the risk management tech,

109
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,250
were not focused on user experience.

110
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,010
That was like a first thing
that you guys focused on

111
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,930
even before we came up with requirements.

112
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,830
That was interesting.

113
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,470
Anything you want to add Solomon about?

114
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,290
- It's surprising the number of users

115
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,430
we have on our product.

116
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,360
We have roughly 10,000
internal Capital One users

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,040
who use our platform.

118
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,230
So you think about building a software

119
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,350
that is world class for
our internal customers,

120
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,420
and not only is the software
supposed to be world class,

121
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,600
but it's also forward-leaning
where we try to do things

122
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,640
that are different than, you know,

123
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,960
if it's gonna be the business,

124
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,790
risk management is your business,

125
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,160
the value we attach to the solution

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,570
and the platform is a lot different.

127
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,640
And that was, I think,
a part of the vision

128
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,220
is not to mimic what was already

129
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,870
in the marketplace in this space,

130
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,090
and I think we have great
products, of course,

131
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,940
but what we wanted to set to achieve

132
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,720
not so that, you know, Matt talked about

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,700
that is truly something
that doesn't exist.

134
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,610
And we said, hey, we want
to go there ourselves.

135
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,270
So, the vision is to provide a service

136
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,720
for our 10,000 risk
officers or risk managers,

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,250
if you would, at Capital One,

138
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,394
a way to do their jobs better.

139
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:35,310
- Okay.

140
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,860
All right, both of you
mentioned risk being core

141
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,330
to the business, right?

142
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,190
And it's not just a control function.

143
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,830
So how does that mindset influence

144
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,933
the way you design technology?

145
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,963
Solomon, you wanna take that?

146
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:51,630
- Yeah, so when we set on this path,

147
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,637
what we realized was this is, you know,

148
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:59,517
at an abstract level, an
object model and design, right?

149
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,260
You think about objects as risks,

150
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,240
controls, issues, and events.

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,030
So when we start to boil down
an abstract at that level,

152
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,910
we are like, hey, what
does the system look like

153
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,250
you know, that is able to scale

154
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,080
and be flexible with object handling?

155
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,370
That's where we ended up,

156
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,111
and that was the first
version of the product,

157
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:19,440
the first version of what
we started to build out.

158
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,850
And as we start to, you know,

159
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,270
get into the 2023, 2024,
a couple of years in,

160
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,990
we realized the object
relationships are critical,

161
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,960
and all of a sudden it
allows us to interact

162
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,270
or technically transact
with these objects.

163
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,480
That's where, if you look at the design,

164
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,250
you know, that's the design.

165
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,050
What it has allowed us
to do is it allowed us

166
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,810
to move from a product
mindset to a platform mindset.

167
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,730
So now that you have objects,

168
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,110
you've created the relationships,

169
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,370
and you're able to interact,

170
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,110
now we have an assessment as a transaction

171
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,310
with these objects,

172
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,650
and all of a sudden these
things become alive,

173
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,960
and it's less and less like
what we started off with,

174
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,320
which is reactive risk
management to now the proactive.

175
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,490
I think the next step is what
Matt hit on the vision stuff.

176
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,670
- I think that's a great view
that like architecture design,

177
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,520
as I think about like the
user experience design,

178
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,910
as you said we have 10,000
users across the company,

179
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,403
every line of business
and every line of defense.

180
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,370
We want our software to be so good

181
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,070
that our product is in
demand across the company.

182
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,240
And you can tell me, but I'm guessing

183
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,640
there aren't a lot of businesses out there

184
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,837
where people like love their
risk management software,

185
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:29,310
but we sort of set that as a goal

186
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,590
we wanna work backward from.

187
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,520
You know, Solomon referenced

188
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,940
like we want world-class experiences.

189
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,640
Like Capital One uses net promoter scores

190
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,490
to see how our credit card
customers are feeling.

191
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,780
We use net promoter scores

192
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,020
to see how our GRC users are feeling.

193
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,610
And you know, we've gone on a journey

194
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,120
from like way negative to mildly positive,

195
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,610
but we're gonna keep going
until we have like a product

196
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,380
that people are demanding,

197
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,820
and you know, we want
business leaders coming to us.

198
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,310
So most of our users are not like

199
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,810
in the risk management organization.

200
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,780
They're out in the business
running the company,

201
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,730
and I want them to say, this is a product,

202
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,550
this is a platform that
helps me do my job better,

203
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,950
it helps me understand my risks better.

204
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,500
- Yeah, I've not come
across any other banks,

205
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,390
risk technology having NPS.

206
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,850
And I've seen the tracking
go higher and higher,

207
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,590
which is like amazing.

208
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,630
And the other thing I've
noticed, even for the...

209
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,970
I mean, GRC used to be the old term.

210
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,630
They changed to IRM, right,
integrated risk management.

211
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,720
Even with the new
cloud-native vendor products

212
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,010
that are there, I've seen like
large financial institutions,

213
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,230
when somebody's responsible

214
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,850
for building the RIG change management,

215
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,950
somebody else is for issues management,

216
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,140
and they both create like
their own data model,

217
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,780
creating duplicates, which
was a traditional issue.

218
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,790
And having the object model,

219
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,438
that's so you have one set of
risk, controls, regulations

220
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:55,563
that's used across, I think,

221
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:58,800
that like makes the
reporting and all that easy.

222
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
So follow-up question, Solomon.

223
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,670
So, how does the risk real-time
decision making look like

224
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,590
in practice for risk teams?

225
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,850
And how did cloud-native
design make that achievable?

226
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,220
- So if you think about real time,

227
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,880
the need for real time is now, right?

228
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,880
So if you think about where
we are as as a species, right,

229
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,910
with the internet and the connectivity,

230
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,440
everything is connected.

231
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,200
So when you think about
what your boundaries were,

232
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,930
it's not even the international
boundaries anymore.

233
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,680
You're affected by markets
across the world, for example.

234
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,020
So if you're in a financial
firm and you have financial

235
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,240
and non-financial risk
that you're managing,

236
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,840
real-time risk management
is scanning the horizon

237
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,720
to understand what your risk ratings are

238
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,090
relative to what you thought
they were supposed to be,

239
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,170
but if you have a stationary
backward-looking way

240
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,008
of scoring a risk, then you're
not gonna be able to react

241
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,350
to what I think are changes
that are now available

242
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,450
in real time for you to react to, right?

243
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,500
You have the social media,
the sentiment analysis,

244
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,270
all kinds of things that are available.

245
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,010
And then on the flip side,

246
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,110
we talked about internal
customers, Matt and I.

247
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,818
We also have the regulators

248
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:14,190
as a customer of ourselves as well.

249
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,480
So we are here to serve them

250
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,390
because they ultimately make us successful

251
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,450
and safe for the customers
that we care about.

252
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,610
So again, you think about
real-time intelligence

253
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,190
is also understanding how
the regulators want us

254
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,710
to prove how safe we are.

255
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,260
So you start to think about the needs

256
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,690
of the market are changing.

257
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,840
So real time is not
something that we want to do,

258
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,730
it's something we have to do.

259
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,960
So now you then you switch

260
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,400
to the cloud-native version
of your application.

261
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,743
That allows you to have...

262
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:48,990
You know, we are lucky at at Capital One

263
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,680
to have the entire ecosystem on the cloud.

264
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,500
So now as new services
become available to AWS,

265
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,120
we are able to leverage them.

266
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,360
We're able to buy what we
think are commodity products

267
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,310
or services to tack on
while we focus on features

268
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,020
that are truly setting us apart

269
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,420
in the integrated risk
management tech space.

270
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,730
So real time for me is not, hey,

271
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,050
we are doing it and we are special.

272
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,720
It's something that we
think you have to do,

273
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,890
and we are able to do it

274
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,583
because of the cloud-native
aspect of our application.

275
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,890
- Anything you wanna add, Matt?

276
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,723
- No.

277
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:25,950
- Yeah, I mean, I think this
makes a big difference, right?

278
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,290
Like back in 2008 financial crisis,

279
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,090
I know like Lehman, (indistinct),

280
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,610
they all had like a large
risk management teams,

281
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,070
but they were not able to
hedge, and even recently

282
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,890
with Silicon Valley Bank,
Signature, et cetera,

283
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,600
I think it's truly not having

284
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,570
a real-time risk management platform

285
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,150
that caused part of the issues they faced.

286
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,770
So let's move into security.

287
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,660
I got a couple of questions on this.

288
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,860
One, Capital One has been
vocal about treating security

289
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,720
as an engineering discipline.

290
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,823
What does that look like day to day?

291
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,423
- I'll try to take a shot at this.

292
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,890
So, you know, if you boil down what we do

293
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,390
for a living in international services,

294
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,620
we are taking care of someone,

295
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,820
our customers' money, right?

296
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,165
It's something that's very
personal and very attached

297
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,580
to a lot of their own
successes and dreams.

298
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,260
So it's something that we have
to take extremely seriously,

299
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,400
and it's actually a bedrock

300
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,040
of, I think, how Capital One thinks.

301
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,270
You know, if you look at our strategies,

302
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,930
it's always been foundationally
about the customers

303
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,843
and since we handle a very
personal part of their lives.

304
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,800
So for me, security is a
couple of versions, right?

305
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,540
One is the data that we use,
which is again very critical

306
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,790
to our decisioning at the
same time needs to be secure.

307
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,350
So we have pretty, you know, a
high sophisticated encryption

308
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,600
for data at rest.

309
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,430
And then when you transmit, so S3,

310
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,850
and we have versions on AWS
that we're able to leverage.

311
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,330
And then in terms of
the application itself,

312
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,950
we have pretty, you know, interesting,

313
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,590
sophisticated identity management,

314
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,874
and then the app level
securities is something

315
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:04,740
we have inherent from the cloud,

316
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,040
provided in this case AWS.

317
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:10,350
You know, in addition to
all these three things,

318
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,303
the developer velocity,

319
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,130
the velocity in which
we are producing code

320
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,440
has dramatically increased in Capital One.

321
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
We have, you know, a lot of engineers.

322
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,390
So now we have to have the
engineering discipline start

323
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,280
with first being, you know, secure.

324
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,580
So we have invested a
ton of time and money

325
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,790
in developer tools that
your very first step

326
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,400
is to be writing code that is secure.

327
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,390
So we've come at it from all three levels

328
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,270
because, like I said, it's
extremely important to us,

329
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,820
so we want to make sure it's done right.

330
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,653
- Got it.

331
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:49,560
Back when I was a developer,

332
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,240
you generally build the application first,

333
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,830
and then you go through a security review,

334
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,030
they give recommendations,

335
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,010
and then you just try to meet it.

336
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,170
So, I think you covered
it part of it, right?

337
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,003
Like how did you...

338
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,600
Was there anything specific you did

339
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,370
to embed security into
your development lifecycle

340
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,660
than just bolting it on the end?

341
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,890
- Like I said, step one.
- Yeah.

342
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,173
- So from the time you
check code into GIT,

343
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,160
the security level at the code base level,

344
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,073
and then we have...

345
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,410
I think we've tried to stay

346
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,010
on top of all the scans
as they become available.

347
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,540
They've gotten better and better.

348
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,700
And again, it allows us to scan

349
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,380
and then to remediate the vulnerabilities

350
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,737
because we are on the
cloud versus you know?

351
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:30,270
Trying to stay ahead
of the vulnerabilities

352
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,210
is a very key lift we get
from being on the cloud

353
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,500
and automatic, you know,
infrastructure development, right?

354
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,320
Infrastructure as code
allows us to stay in front.

355
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,153
- Got it.

356
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,170
So next session is the
more interesting one,

357
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,070
at least for me, because Capital
One is one of the very few,

358
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,870
I mean probably the only
financial institution

359
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,070
that built its own platform,
whereas everybody...

360
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,240
There is strength in numbers, right?

361
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,010
Almost every other bank buys one

362
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,490
of their traditional GRC solution,

363
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,000
and the challenge they face
is you have one solution

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,310
or one vendor for RIG change management,

365
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,700
another for like GRC,
and then one for AML,

366
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,870
one for RIG reporting.

367
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,480
And there's like many of them,
the challenge they face is,

368
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
how do you integrate it
specifically for reporting, right?

369
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
There is like redundant data in there.

370
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
I was like amazed that like again,

371
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,290
six years ago, you guys made the decision

372
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,720
to build it and that to in AWS.

373
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,360
Now, the more I see in the market,

374
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,630
I think as the AWS
features are ramping up,

375
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,740
it makes more sense.

376
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,480
And I also see a lot of PE companies

377
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,360
buy these vendor solutions,
and licensing fees goes up.

378
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,130
So, I mean, it's just brilliant

379
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,130
that you guys decided like
six years ago to do it.

380
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,513
So Matt, for you,

381
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,560
so many organizations might default

382
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,420
to buying GRC solution off the shelf.

383
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,643
Why did you decide to build instead?

384
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,310
- Yeah, ultimately, we view GRC

385
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,723
as one of the cores of risk management.

386
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,590
Many of our most important
risk management functions

387
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,450
as a company are in this platform,

388
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,300
whether it's assessing
risks or testing controls

389
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,280
or managing issues and events,

390
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,680
adhering to regulatory
requirements, as you said.

391
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,200
Those are some of the most
important things we do

392
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,960
in all of risk management
are all in one place.

393
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,200
So the functionality is
critically important.

394
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,390
And then we'd already touched
on sort of the user scale.

395
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,300
You know, we have 10,000 users,

396
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,100
every line of business,
every line of defense.

397
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,540
This isn't a, you know,
bespoke tool for one audience.

398
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,220
This has the biggest potential

399
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,880
to reshape risk management as the company.

400
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,720
So we viewed this

401
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,420
as like, you know, we wanna be selective

402
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,120
about where we're making
these big investments

403
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,000
and big bets and and
viewed GRC as one of them.

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,290
Just to give a counterpoint,

405
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,820
there's another area of risk management

406
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,303
where we were on a path to
build an in-house platform,

407
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,810
and we actually stopped
that work earlier this year.

408
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,095
And if you just put that
through the same lens,

409
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:01,050
it was like tens of users,
not thousands of users,

410
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,810
and they were all in one department.

411
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,940
And you know, there's vendor solutions

412
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,910
that do the thing pretty good,

413
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,280
and there's obviously pretty
good GRC solutions as well,

414
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,390
but like this is an area

415
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,160
where we don't think
pretty good is good enough.

416
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Like this is where we can really shape

417
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,423
how we approach risk as a company.

418
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,720
- Solomon, anything you want to add?

419
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,700
- First is like, you
know, Matt had the trust

420
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,950
in our team to say let's
go build it, right?

421
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,743
So fundamentally, you know,

422
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,210
it was an opportunity for
the engineering team as well.

423
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,210
But for us, we did have two GRC platforms

424
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,010
that we had bought from vendors.

425
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,570
What we thought it lacked

426
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,020
was the flexibility for the business.

427
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,340
And as the business starts
to reimagine risk management,

428
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,020
like Matt, you know, he clearly said

429
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,700
it's not a cost play for us

430
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,520
if we wanna do it exceptionally well.

431
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,410
And then when you start
looking at the platforms

432
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,990
that, you know, we were
buying or we had in-house,

433
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,690
they wouldn't allow us
to do certain things

434
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,256
the way we wanted to.

435
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:07,380
So we felt that we were getting boxed in.

436
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,110
And so we started a little
bit of a peeling off

437
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,120
layer by layer approach first.

438
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,360
And then, like I said,
the object architecture,

439
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,940
like when we got to, can
we define the object,

440
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,250
the metadata, and the
interactions with them,

441
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,290
then it started to kind of fall in place.

442
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,820
We did have a couple of false starts.

443
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,800
We kind of reset a little bit,

444
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,387
but it was done for the right reasons,

445
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:33,120
but we also had a very patient business

446
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,410
because they could see the vision,

447
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,360
and their vision was
slightly aspirational,

448
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,770
which didn't kind of work

449
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,930
with what was in the market for us.

450
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,010
- Got it.

451
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,380
Yeah, just so, Matt, back to you, right,

452
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,370
what are some of the tradeoffs,
right, like between...

453
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,940
I mean, these vendor companies
have spent a lot on R and D.

454
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,190
They have a lot of like peer experience

455
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,010
building the solutions over the years.

456
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,810
So what are some of the tradeoffs

457
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,810
that you had to deal with
when you made this decision?

458
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,450
- Yeah, I think as Solomon
said, it's not like a cost play.

459
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,120
It's not, you know, we
can do this on the cheap,

460
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,920
but I think ultimately it comes down

461
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,110
to that element of like the
flexibility and control.

462
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,710
We can build the risk management
exactly the way we want it,

463
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,290
and, you know, we can
continually customize it.

464
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,160
We don't need to fit our risk management

465
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,310
into, you know, what is
the best possible solution

466
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,550
with the container that's been
given to us by a third party.

467
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,520
We can create what we want,

468
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,590
develop that strategy and roadmap.

469
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,680
We have no shortage of
leaders around the company

470
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,210
coming to us with ideas.

471
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,530
You know, it's always a good situation

472
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,280
to have a longer backlog
than capacity to deliver it,

473
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,010
but you know, when I see
that I think, gosh, I'm glad

474
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,260
that we control this entirely ourselves

475
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,230
versus, you know, whoa, we'll
go talk to another company

476
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,170
and see if we can make
this type of thing work.

477
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,003
- Got it.

478
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,380
So, I mean, my view, right,

479
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,550
even though most of my clients

480
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,870
are like banks in the East Coast,

481
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,380
I've spent fair amount of time
in Silicon Valley as well.

482
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,430
I mean, their approach,

483
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,590
when I deal with CRO CCOs

484
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,500
is not look at like what others are there.

485
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,790
And I felt like, you know,

486
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,190
from an engineering point of view,

487
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,590
the example I use is when
Uber designed the software,

488
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,300
they didn't go and look
at like what software

489
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,530
taxi companies are using.

490
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,190
So same way you guys didn't look at,

491
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,650
hey, what is the leading GRC platform?

492
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,090
Let's copy their features.

493
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,660
So, my question is, how did
your engineering culture

494
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,390
and tech capabilities make the building

495
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,313
of this solution possible?

496
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,530
- A couple of people in the audience

497
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,300
are part of that journey.

498
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,760
So I'm very proud to have them on my team.

499
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,800
The idea of...

500
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,550
So when you look at
what the platforms were,

501
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,260
so when we said what are the features

502
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,560
that we wanted to pivot on,

503
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,300
one was the flexibility of
the object handling itself.

504
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,700
A second was the quality of data

505
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,970
that we wanted to capture
by object was key.

506
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,910
So the metadata handling by object

507
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,190
and then how we wanted
to try interact with it

508
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,200
was, I think, different
than what the others had.

509
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,470
They wanted to have a very
straightforward workflow.

510
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,300
So when we started to
peel these things off,

511
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,340
we said, hey, the workflow's
gonna be separate,

512
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,570
the objects are gonna be separate,

513
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,610
the metadata is gonna be flexible.

514
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,770
Then we started to put
those things together.

515
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,867
Then we were able to...

516
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:20,250
Like I said, it was not a all in.

517
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,160
We moved a couple of objects first.

518
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
The risks moved over first.

519
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,010
The controls moved over second.

520
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,540
So we had a path.

521
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,030
And then when we start to see some success

522
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,370
and then the backlog that
Matt was talking about

523
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,290
started to load up, which means we started

524
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,330
to see customers actually get attracted

525
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,670
to the way we were thinking
about the solution,

526
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,310
then I think it kind of took a second.

527
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,070
Like I think the second
wind was a lot different.

528
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,020
We put a lot more investment in it.

529
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,460
Now the number of teams increased.

530
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,830
The kind of things we
built changed as well.

531
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,197
- Got it, and when you built the software,

532
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:54,217
you didn't expect that
Discover acquisition.

533
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,180
So Discover as, you know,
they were using a traditional

534
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,910
like a GRC platform as well.

535
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,640
So, how was that integration?

536
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,560
Now you build the solution.

537
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,613
It's live.

538
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,780
And obviously when you're
migrating the existing data

539
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,960
from Discover, was that like a challenge,

540
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,350
or do you have to make any
changes to your platform?

541
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,150
How did you still like, you know, manage

542
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,340
to stay ahead of this emerging risks

543
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,023
and regulatory expectations?

544
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,880
- Yeah, so we haven't
done the integration yet,

545
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,510
but we are going to,
and I think this is one

546
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,460
of the big advantages we have of,

547
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,440
we're gonna bring a bunch of new users in,

548
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,510
we're gonna bring all that extra data in,

549
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,580
and our platform is just gonna scale.

550
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,960
We are gonna change some things

551
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,490
'cause we're entering new business lines.

552
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,080
We need to customize some fields.

553
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,250
We need to...

554
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,550
There's new sort of regulatory
risks we need to consider,

555
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,620
but again, we own the backlog,

556
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,390
and we can make that prioritization

557
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,560
and make those make those changes.

558
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,180
Ultimately, there's a huge advantage

559
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,900
of our regulators are familiar

560
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,330
with the way Capital One
does risk management,

561
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,740
and the way we do risk management

562
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,930
is built into our GRC platform.

563
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,730
So when Discover comes in,

564
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,550
they will inherit our
risk management posture

565
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,790
simply by inheriting our software.

566
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,650
- Got it, anything you wanna add, Solomon?

567
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,990
- I mean, Matt kind of brushed by it,

568
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,670
but the regulators have been a part

569
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,510
of our journey too.

570
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,850
The entire, it's not something...

571
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,100
We actually talked to the
regulators about the fact

572
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,480
that we are building our own platform,

573
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,570
and they were getting periodic updates

574
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,150
on the platform as we built it.

575
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,140
That was key.

576
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,770
And then this whole Discover migration,

577
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,240
I've been through a few myself,

578
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,090
but the way we looked at this
migration was way different

579
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,960
simply because we owned the embedded logic

580
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,990
that implemented the policy
that we wanted to implement.

581
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,823
So now you're like, hey,

582
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:52,860
the policy's already a part of the code,

583
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,320
so when you bring users on,
users inherit the policy.

584
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,690
So the training aspects of it,

585
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,690
more importantly, following,
I think, our practices

586
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,880
versus Discover practices,

587
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,790
would've been a bigger
change management event

588
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,740
than it ended up being.

589
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,300
It ended up being, and
then like Matt said,

590
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,380
we are on the path of
merging with Discover

591
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,610
over the next couple of months.

592
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,500
- You mentioned regulators a few times,

593
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,270
and you said regulators as a customer.

594
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,510
I mean, generally they seem
to be like an afterthought

595
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,160
for most people.

596
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,890
Do you give access to the regulators or...

597
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,390
Yeah?
- Yeah.

598
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,223
- That's very interesting.

599
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:31,050
So I mean, no session is
complete without discussing AI.

600
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,230
So next question is, how
do you see risk compliance

601
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,010
and AI converging in the
next three to five years?

602
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,510
- I think all the other rooms

603
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,870
have a lot more answers to AI than us.

604
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,080
I think, you know, for us, risk
management is the business.

605
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,460
So Matt and I are part of
the risk management team.

606
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,950
For us, managing the
risk that AI introduces

607
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,800
is for me more than as an engineer

608
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,020
I'm looking at AI as a fun way

609
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,150
of solving for my customers as well.

610
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,830
I weigh both.

611
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,060
And I think, you know, AI
in risk management is going

612
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,980
to allow us to be this whole
real time and more proactive.

613
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,750
I think we've already
seen a couple of instances

614
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,270
where when the regulations come in,

615
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,640
to understand the regulation summarization

616
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,650
and theming is already something

617
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,180
that we have in the marketplace today.

618
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,000
PWC has a version of the product already

619
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,300
that is very extremely,
you know, engineered.

620
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,400
It's a beautiful product actually.

621
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,520
But now you're talking
about GenAI going past that,

622
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,390
which should be themes on loads

623
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,890
and loads of data against the history

624
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,720
and to see and predict and
say, hey, what the risks are.

625
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,620
I think that's gonna be very exciting,

626
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,493
and I'm assuming the regulators

627
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:51,030
will have a very pointed
view on how we manage risk.

628
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,190
Do we listen to the AI
model and manage risk,

629
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,450
or do we do it ourselves?

630
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,120
So that's gonna be an
interesting next couple of years.

631
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,163
But more importantly,
the fact that the product

632
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,873
that we built, the GRC product,

633
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,100
as we start to increase
this whole net scale,

634
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,500
scale of functionality,

635
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,170
we manage controls, risks, and issues now,

636
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,920
think about managing an
object, which is just a model.

637
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,400
The machine learning model,
MLM, small language model.

638
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,850
These are all now things
that have to be governed

639
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,970
to perform within the boundaries
of a financial services.

640
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,820
So that for me, I think we
are positioned really well

641
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,640
because we can now scale our GRC platform

642
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,130
to be a part of that risk management.

643
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,900
- So you're not really waiting for vendors

644
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,680
to add AI capabilities
because it's cloud native.

645
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,420
When AWS releases new features,

646
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,850
you're able to integrate it
and make it future proof.

647
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,930
- Yeah.

648
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,780
- So one, I know we've discussed
this in the past, right,

649
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,710
like currently, I mean, part
of the like regulatory function

650
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,730
is to do the reporting, right?

651
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,670
You do YNC, call report, liquidity report,

652
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,520
daily liquidity report, right, 2052a,

653
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,470
and the regulators use all this data

654
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,300
to look at the stability of the bank.

655
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,880
They also try to see...

656
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,620
They kind of compare what they get

657
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,300
versus the management reports.

658
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,210
With your like, you
know, single data model,

659
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,760
you can make sure there is consistency.

660
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,650
Any view on how the regulatory
expectations might change

661
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,740
over the, you know, next
three to five years?

662
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,573
- I'll go to Matt.
(Matt laughs)

663
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,773
Matt meets with them every day, so.

664
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:29,652
- You know, I think the
expectations will continue to rise.

665
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,290
I think they'll continue
to be more of a focus

666
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,050
on, you know, how are we leveraging AI

667
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,640
and where should we be leveraging AI

668
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,090
and what are the risks of AI.

669
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,250
I think the broader risk
management environment

670
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,330
continues to get more complex.

671
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,320
I think expectations of
banks will rise over time,

672
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,530
and, you know, we need to be
able to keep pace with that.

673
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,363
- Yeah, definitely.

674
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:58,620
And I think, Solomon, you
mentioned before, right,

675
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,610
like on how regulators

676
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,860
instead of using this tabulated format,

677
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,680
which is where like a lot of
the effort is spent currently

678
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,150
on doing the reporting,

679
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,810
they could potentially
access your data through API.

680
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,590
- See, I mean, when you
say you can engineer

681
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,920
at scale, right, it goes both ways.

682
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,830
So it's one thing for us
as a company to do this,

683
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,690
which we are on our journey.

684
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,450
I'm assuming the regulators
are on their own journey

685
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,220
in using technology

686
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,200
to make their governance
processes bigger or better.

687
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,460
In this case, you do a sample
test, you can go to full file.

688
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,710
If I do full file, so can
the regulators, right?

689
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,010
So now the data, it's on
an S3 bucket on the cloud.

690
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,110
If I can write an API call, so can they.

691
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,760
So now you start to see the confluence

692
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,770
of their engineering catching up

693
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,980
or even sometimes going faster than we are

694
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,200
in terms of how they consume data.

695
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,110
All of a sudden, we
have to meet them there.

696
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,090
So I feel like that's where it's gonna go,

697
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,500
and it's already starting,

698
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,630
of all places in Australia actually

699
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,020
is that the regulators
actually have a full file test

700
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,130
as a part of their process.

701
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,130
It hasn't come to the west
yet, but it's not far away.

702
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,700
- Definitely, and I've
seen a number of banks,

703
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,020
they have like three lines of defense.

704
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,450
Each of them do like a
sample based testing,

705
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,560
and they still miss things.

706
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,390
And regulators come in,
they're like smarter

707
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,800
on how they pick samples,

708
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,030
and I've seen situations

709
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,620
where they pick like selected sample

710
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,563
and find like 90% error rate,
they need to go redo it,

711
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,490
and depends on what you pick,
how you test it, et cetera.

712
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,580
So the full file testing
seems to be the future.

713
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,520
And the challenge with
that is access to the data,

714
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,050
which most institutions struggle.

715
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,500
I know CFPB tried to do that

716
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,940
with a lot of their data collection,

717
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,550
but I think with the
current administration

718
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,470
that's not active.

719
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,020
I do think it's a good
opportunity right now

720
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,670
that the enforcement actions

721
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,410
have reduced the staffing

722
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,570
for the regulators have reduced.

723
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,200
And since like financial crisis,

724
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,790
in order to banks to show

725
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,070
that they're taking regulators seriously,

726
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,710
they've been building up the
risk management function.

727
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,190
And I feel like now with the less scrutiny

728
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,660
might be a perfect opportunity

729
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,370
to go back and like automate,

730
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,170
like, you know, people are
talking about agent take AI

731
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,270
and other things to doing it.

732
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,790
It looks like you guys have a
good foundation for all that.

733
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,770
- I think that exists already now, right?

734
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,500
So that doesn't have to be in the future.

735
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,210
That's something we are
looking at right now

736
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,360
is the automation of the controls testing.

737
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,190
We have data products at Capital One.

738
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,290
We take data extremely seriously.

739
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,773
It's very precious to us.

740
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:35,220
It's what the company's founded on

741
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,490
is our way we analyze data
to run our businesses.

742
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,790
So you think about right
now what we're trying

743
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,150
to tackle is the automation
of the controls testing.

744
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:50,150
Like we can test the controls
much, you know, often

745
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,223
than we do right now.

746
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:54,060
The cadence can be much more frequent.

747
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,340
So those are things that
are already existing now.

748
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,080
That's not gonna be an AI play.

749
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,180
It's gonna be something that anybody

750
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,390
with good data stewardship
should be able to do.

751
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,520
That's one of the things that we're trying

752
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,610
to think about as well.

753
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,020
- Yeah, one thing I found interesting,

754
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,580
the way you approach, Solomon,

755
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,590
is that you took the software engineering.

756
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,780
It used to be software development cycle.

757
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,630
I develop, give it to
Matt, he'll go test it,

758
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,150
and then there is integrated
testing and then you release.

759
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,820
So you've taken the concept
of the CICD pipeline

760
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,290
and brought it into risk management.

761
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,580
Can you talk about it?

762
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,633
- Well, the idea is, you know,

763
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,400
a CICD pipeline is essentially
a risk management play

764
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,490
on a software engineer to prevent a bug

765
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,340
from going into production by scans.

766
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,530
And, you know, early on testing

767
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,050
with a lot of automation reduces the risk

768
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,030
of a problem happening in production.

769
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,820
So a risk management practice
is nothing different.

770
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,820
And like, you don't want
a risk to realize, right?

771
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,200
That's the sense of
what we're trying to do.

772
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,015
So now when you look at,

773
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:52,410
I don't wanna go into the numbers,

774
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,880
I'm not allowed to, I'm saying,

775
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,540
but we have x number of
risks and we control them,

776
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,310
and they have various scores.

777
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,220
And so when you have
something that is testable,

778
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,470
why does it need to be
tested once every six months

779
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,155
if you have the data and
the testing is automatable

780
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:09,150
and, you know, we have the data

781
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,630
and we can get to a much
more frequent version

782
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,760
of the testing is our vision.

783
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,380
So while not the whole suite,

784
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,390
we can't test the whole
control, all the controls,

785
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,440
we are looking at the ones

786
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,980
that are, you know, closer
to the engineering space,

787
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,370
especially around the
engineers that we have.

788
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,940
We have a lot of software policies,

789
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,260
you know, risk management policies

790
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,370
that we're trying to automate,

791
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,480
and it's very straightforward

792
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,930
because the data is in all
the logs that we have in AWS.

793
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,180
So, you know, we see that
on the engineering side.

794
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,860
We're like, hey, how does that look

795
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,070
on the business side is a
very, very interesting problem.

796
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,903
- Definitely.

797
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,790
So currently, well, you mentioned

798
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,170
you have like 10,000 users.

799
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,630
Does that include Discover, or that's-

800
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,620
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

801
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,410
- What do you expect the
number of users to be?

802
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,159
- Probably 15.

803
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,920
- (laughs) That's a
lot of risk management.

804
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,170
- These are practitioners.

805
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,003
We call them risk practitioners.

806
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:02,836
- Risk practitioners.

807
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:05,493
- They're involved in
first line, second line.

808
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,010
Third line wouldn't
count, but third line too.

809
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,720
Yeah, third line.
- Third line's on that, yeah..

810
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,030
- So related, so, Matt, you mentioned

811
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,260
about the net promoter score.

812
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,200
So what do you do if this score goes down?

813
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,491
I know it's been like (indistinct).

814
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,400
(panelists chuckle)

815
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,320
- I mean, we pull all of
our users twice a year,

816
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,660
and, you know, it's sort of, to me,

817
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,660
one of the most important exercises we get

818
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,580
throughout the year of
getting all of that feedback.

819
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,860
You know, out of that, we might,

820
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,950
you know, ask thousands
of users for feedback,

821
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,650
get, you know, 500 responses,

822
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,860
and a lot of people are
writing detailed comments.

823
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,810
So really pouring through
those to understand

824
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,930
like what are the pain points
and what could be even better

825
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,320
and using that to shape
the roadmap in the future.

826
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,110
Ideally this is like,
you're not learning a lot

827
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,280
because it's every six months,

828
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,770
and you know, one of the
highlights of our job

829
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,830
is that our users work in
the same buildings as us.

830
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,140
So, we should be able to just walk around

831
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,370
and say, "Hey, how's it going,"

832
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,990
and like, hear things without having

833
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,820
to wait for a big survey,

834
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,310
but it's a great touch
point to like check in

835
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,540
and make sure and confirm.

836
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,830
And we've definitely had times

837
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,380
when, you know, things were going wrong

838
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,370
and we didn't know about them

839
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,040
until it's like, wait a minute,
12 people said this thing.

840
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,870
You know, like, did you
know this was happening?

841
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,920
I didn't know this was happening.

842
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,693
And then we can jump all over it.

843
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,840
So we look for all those opportunities

844
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,410
to yeah, continue to make sure

845
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,200
the score is going in the right direction.

846
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,033
- Awesome.

847
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,500
All right, so with respect
to some closing questions,

848
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,820
I have like a few.

849
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,210
So, Matt, for you, if you
had to pick one key lesson

850
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,450
from this journey, what
would you tell peers

851
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,593
who are just beginning their,
you know, GRC modernization?

852
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:52,670
- Don't do it!

853
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,350
(Lakshman laughs)

854
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,430
No, seriously, I think probably
the most important thing

855
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,230
is know what you're getting yourself into.

856
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,400
It's not for the faint of heart.

857
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,690
It's a big investment.

858
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,610
It takes a lot of time, you know.

859
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,020
And typically we like to
develop software in an MVP form.

860
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,730
Like let's just ship like a little bit.

861
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,770
You know, we'll get feedback.

862
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,150
We'll iterate on it,

863
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,980
but this is an environment
where it's often like,

864
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,270
well, you can't flip all of
your risk management over

865
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,700
if it like doesn't really work yet.

866
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,560
It has to be at least as good as the thing

867
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,720
you're replacing before you go live.

868
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,540
So it can lead to longer
development cycles

869
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,833
than we'd like to have.

870
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,410
As I said, it's a big investment.

871
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,910
It can take a lot of time,

872
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,880
but I, you know, have felt the journey

873
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,620
is incredibly worthwhile,

874
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,530
but I think, you know, if you think

875
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,330
you can like dabble your way into it

876
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,120
or like, you know, this will
be like a little side project

877
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,100
and it'll come to fruition,

878
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,320
I think you need to go in eyes wide open

879
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,620
with understanding the level of investment

880
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,360
and time commitment.

881
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,530
- Anything you want to add, Solomon?

882
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,260
- I think change management was key.

883
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,530
I think I would say we
did a pretty good job

884
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,440
in anticipating what it means

885
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,200
to change the tires out
while still reporting

886
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,150
to the regulators on
your existing platform.

887
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,250
So risk management never stops.

888
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,040
You could swap the software all day long,

889
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,440
but you're still held
accountable every quarter

890
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,380
to the board, to the
regulators and examiners.

891
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,380
So in our case, I think
the change management

892
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,030
was done really well.

893
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,030
The harder thing was, you
know, the customer feedback,

894
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,360
not knowing what they want initially,

895
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,000
and then we are trying
to, you know, change

896
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,070
into a different way of thinking almost.

897
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,330
So that was kind of a little bit,

898
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,980
but then like Matt said,

899
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,970
the NPS has been a great
indicator of us headed

900
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,410
in the right direction or not.

901
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,150
And you have to understand,

902
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,150
our lease velocities are
a few hundred a month.

903
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,000
So we're putting features
behind feature flags.

904
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,530
We're deploying them.

905
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,310
And we have started to
now even go past the NPS

906
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,100
to say buy feature behind a feature flag.

907
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,690
Can you tell us how you feel about it?

908
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,510
So the experimentation changes
have started to kick in.

909
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,870
This is all again, evolution,
of you building software

910
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,630
on the cloud and the
things it allows you to do

911
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,830
are a lot different.

912
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,150
So now we started to see

913
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,030
even different user interaction patterns,

914
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,950
and user feedback loops are different.

915
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,800
So it's been pretty cool
the last few months.

916
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
- Yeah, so I think from
my my perspective, right,

917
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,280
like you are having your own
strong risk management platform

918
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,900
has been like a differentiator.

919
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,890
And from the sense

920
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,070
like when regulators approved
the Discover transaction,

921
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,440
that was part of the reason
like everybody is like,

922
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,080
hey, I'm using the software
every other bank uses,

923
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,730
and the data is as good as it gets

924
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,730
versus like owning this
and using this platform

925
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,547
reduced your like, you
know, enforcement actions

926
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:53,940
and any outstanding...

927
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,760
I really think that's
what like got you approval

928
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,650
to buy Discover.

929
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,140
So on the other end, right, I see still

930
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,230
like a lot of large financial institutions

931
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,360
even hesitant to go to cloud, right?

932
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,270
Like forget like building
risk management on their own.

933
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,180
They're like, oh, we
want the latest solution

934
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,500
that's like a cloud platform,

935
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,470
but we want like an on-prem version of it.

936
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,150
So what is your advice to
organizations that are hesitant

937
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,363
to leap into cloud-native risk management?

938
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,780
- Well, I'm like you guys
are at the AWS Conference,

939
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,600
so I'm assuming it's not
the people in the room,

940
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,370
but those of you watching
on, I don't know.

941
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,420
I don't think anybody's watching live,

942
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,420
but it's just like it's not
even a differentiator anymore.

943
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,350
The cloud, it's a necessity
to just to stay at par.

944
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,190
You're batting at par
you know, with the cloud,

945
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,810
or you're just gonna get left behind.

946
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,460
And then you look at risk management.

947
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,550
Like I said, risk management
has to be a lot different

948
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,420
than you did it before.

949
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,530
It's not simple credit
decisioning or credit modeling.

950
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,410
That's not the only way you're
gonna survive the market.

951
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,530
I think as AI brings in newer products

952
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,999
that are customized at scale
by individual user, right,

953
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:11,100
I think the whole mobile
revolution is done, right?

954
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,950
There's like seven and
a half billion handhelds

955
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,783
in the world.

956
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:18,480
So you're already customized
by individual already.

957
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,120
So then you think in financial products

958
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,580
that are customized by this individual

959
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,650
having a handheld across the world

960
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,930
and then the risk of that, right?

961
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,470
Matt also is our head of our
second line fraud as well.

962
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,130
So he's got another hat
he wears half the day,

963
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,400
and it's even more
interesting when you start

964
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,260
to think about risk
management in the fraud space.

965
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,330
So I just feel like if
you're not on the cloud,

966
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,790
you can't anticipate, you can't react,

967
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,520
and then I don't know how
you exist in the marketplace

968
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,990
as a financial services firm.

969
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,550
So it's gonna be key.

970
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,140
So if there's someone
here at the conference

971
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,730
and doesn't have the cloud,

972
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,990
I would highly recommend
the cloud to you guys.

973
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,890
- Thank you.

974
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,200
And then, Matt, to you to wrap up, right,

975
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,163
what does future-ready risk
organization look like to you?

976
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:07,830
- Yeah, I think it goes back

977
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,570
to the point we started with

978
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,820
of real-time intelligent risk management

979
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,690
where, you know, we are surfacing insights

980
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,300
to users based on all the
data that we've gathered.

981
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,160
We are helping business leaders

982
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,100
around the company to anticipate
what their risk might be

983
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,280
and what could go wrong versus reacting

984
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,960
when things do go wrong.

985
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,610
We're leaning in on generative
AI and using that to automate

986
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:40,610
and build quality into our
workflows and decisions.

987
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:48,050
But yeah, I think we're on
on a journey to get there,

988
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,230
but I think it's a dramatically
different worldview

989
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,290
when you're really managing
risks in that proactive way.

990
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,190
- Awesome.

991
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,810
Matt and Solomon, for taking your time

992
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,790
and thanks everyone for
joining the session.

993
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,680
I know it's tough to find the room.

994
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,754
We gotta walk past all the
free swags and the casino.

995
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,870
(laughs) So thank you so much for joining,

996
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,820
and you know, feel free to
connect with us on LinkedIn

997
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,310
and message there or we can meet outside

998
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,900
to answer any other questions.

999
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,890
- So thank you guys.

1000
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,174
- All right, thank you.

1001
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:17,892
(audience applauds)
