1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,930
- All right, well good morning
slash afternoon to everybody.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,330
This is Architecture 313,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,370
maybe your first breakout session so far

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,840
that you've attended at re:Invent.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,610
How many people this is
like, other than the keynote,

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,443
this is the first thing

7
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:13,890
you've been able to attend?

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,120
A couple people, great.

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,400
Well, thank you for making it all the way

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,660
to the other side of the conference.

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,950
If you attended the keynote this morning

12
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,180
you're the expeditious ones.

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,450
Or if you are like staying close
by on this end of the strip

14
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,920
and knew that you wanted to attend this

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,360
and you did not attend
the keynote in person,

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,250
you're the ones that have
forethought and foresight

17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,600
to make your time efficient.

18
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,730
So anyway, thank you for being here.

19
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,870
My name is Andrew Baird.

20
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm a Senior Principal
Solutions Architect with AWS.

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,030
I work out of our Atlanta, Georgia office.

22
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,060
I've been with AWS for
about 13 and a half years,

23
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,090
and there has been no stretch of time

24
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,550
in my entire career in
technology where I have felt

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,403
as motivated as,

26
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,530
disrupted, as excited as now for sure.

27
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,640
And my past time at AWS
has been mostly dedicated

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,920
to developer-oriented things,

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,820
building systems, DevOps, serverless,

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,300
our API oriented services, CICD,

31
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,640
and the amount of impact

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,220
and the amount of like
capability that's been

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,777
delivered to folks like me

34
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:19,290
and the customers I talked
to in the last 18 months

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,160
is mind blowing.

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,360
And hopefully everybody in the room

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,450
or watching on YouTube,
kind of that resonates with.

38
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,570
And so we're here to talk
to you a little bit about,

39
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,800
for all the folks that maybe
have like career histories

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
and trajectories like myself
that are software builders,

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,270
developers and are like
coming into the fold

42
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,300
of generative AI as it's kind of evolved

43
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,823
into quite a bit of focus around agents.

44
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,250
What are some ways you can take the skills

45
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,260
you've got already and
the things you understand

46
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,420
and bring it into this new world?

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,380
So we're gonna have the
agenda broken out as follows.

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm gonna spend the first
third of the presentation

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,540
talking from a perspective of,

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,080
from AWS talking about how to think about

51
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,760
and understand agents in the context

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,770
of service-oriented architectures.

53
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,740
As a builder, I'm gonna talk about how

54
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,993
some of the design principles and,

55
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,080
important dimensions of building
good distributed systems

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,660
that are service-oriented
really lend themselves well

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,200
or may have evolved in
the world of agentic AI.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,140
I'll drop a couple ideas
about some services

59
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,620
that have existed even before
today's keynote announcements

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,920
that could help you as a builder
getting into generative AI.

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,310
And then I'm joined by
Dan DeLauro from WEX

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,960
who's gonna go much deeper

63
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,800
into a particular use
case in architecture,

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,200
an approach that they
took when building out

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,290
their first set of agentic systems

66
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,970
inside of the organization

67
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,400
so that you can hopefully walk away with,

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,233
at the end of the session,

69
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:57,060
with a lot of like deeper understanding

70
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,109
and a new level of comfort
as a software builder

71
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,120
on how you might think about
approaching these topics

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,460
and building systems,
building agentic systems,

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,170
using a lot of the
knowledge you have already

74
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,820
and getting a lot of like tangible,

75
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,740
credible advice from a team

76
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,660
and a person who's walked that walk

77
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,910
over the last year or so.

78
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,583
So let's jump in.

79
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,193
So agents for builders.

80
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,590
When we've talked about agents

81
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,440
and maybe others have talked about agents,

82
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,370
they're often like displayed
in a way like this.

83
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,140
There's an agent that's doing things

84
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,970
that sound really like personified.

85
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,780
They're observing, they're
taking actions, they're learning.

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,650
And when somebody describes
agents to me in this term,

87
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,460
in these kind of terms,
for me as a technologist,

88
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,920
as a practitioner of technology,

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
it feels fuzzy to me

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,800
and it makes me feel like,

91
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,250
does that mean the capabilities
have become so advanced

92
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,010
that there's this software, these models

93
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,700
that are like living inside
of the systems we deploy,

94
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,340
and they have the ability to take actions

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,600
and literally learn in a way that makes,

96
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,830
everything that I'm used to

97
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,380
and the way that we build
software feel moot now.

98
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,750
And like technology has
evolved past the point

99
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,440
where all of the skills
that feel comfortable to me

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,990
and the knowledge that I've
earned until this point

101
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,160
is being like put at risk in some way.

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,470
And so it gives me this premise of like,

103
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,540
does that mean
service-oriented architectures

104
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,590
are dead in some way?

105
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,260
That we now have software elements

106
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,790
that have superseded the context of

107
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,680
how we design distributed systems

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,250
and the the way in which
they deliver capabilities?

109
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,270
Is this the message now?

110
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,670
Is this where we've reached?

111
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,470
And so I, as a technologist,

112
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,060
what I like to do in those moments

113
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,010
where you feel like something

114
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,170
is just outside your
grasp of understanding

115
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,450
and you want to dig in a little deeper,

116
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,910
you want to understand it from
like a technical perspective

117
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,760
and you dive a layer deeper
and you get hands on.

118
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,370
So what is like observing and
learning all of those things?

119
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,920
They have like technical meaning in

120
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,110
why those descriptors are
often used for agents,

121
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,210
but really like from a
technical perspective,

122
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,010
talking to builders in the room,

123
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,100
and watching the live YouTube stream.

124
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,573
What is an agent really?

125
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,210
In the center of the story,

126
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,920
there's these LLMs, which I don't need

127
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,287
to describe too much of but

128
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:21,540
all of the capability that
a model brings to the table

129
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,190
to do things like reason,

130
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,010
to have varying levels of expertise

131
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,470
across different domains and industries.

132
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,860
There's a way in which we want
to like tap that knowledge

133
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,960
and reasoning capabilities
within the context

134
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,900
of some business scenario.

135
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,850
So that's still part of
like, that's a central part

136
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,120
that I'm comfortable
as a software builder,

137
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,230
I'm not a data scientist,

138
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,540
I'm certainly not an AI researcher.

139
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,893
The amount of like,

140
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,610
advanced technology capability

141
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,780
that's embedded inside that model.

142
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,180
I don't understand it
to a deep enough context

143
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,110
to like extract it and describe
it at a builder perspective.

144
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,790
But that's living at
the heart of the systems

145
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,440
that I'm gonna build with agents.

146
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,310
Talking to that LLM, we
have an agent application,

147
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,100
it's usually a container,
a docker container.

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,400
There's ways in which
building that software,

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,360
and this is maybe what I believe is

150
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,560
one of the biggest advancements
over the last 12 months

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,340
is having technology
companies and developers

152
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,520
get a much better understanding at how to,

153
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,470
how to integrate with models in a way

154
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,470
that let them have a
deeper meaningful impact on

155
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,220
different application contexts.

156
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,060
And so the SDKs like Strands
have made it really easy

157
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,390
to build agent applications,
those docker containers

158
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,760
that are gonna be deployed that define

159
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,060
how the software is gonna
interact with the LLM.

160
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,880
So like how the prompts are structured,

161
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,010
how the different turns in
conversation are gonna occur,

162
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,680
how they manage things like
interaction with memory

163
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
and past conversations

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,650
and integration with tools,

165
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,940
which we'll talk about in a second.

166
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,190
But all of those new elements of how to

167
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,950
well integrate with an LLM

168
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,540
so that you can get
application level capability

169
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,803
out of that model,

170
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,100
is packaged for you in a lot of like neat

171
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,710
and very abstracted ways that developers

172
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,890
are much more comfortable
with and SDKs like Strands.

173
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,880
So I'm gonna call,

174
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,010
I'm gonna draw a box
around those two things.

175
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,220
This docker container-based
deployed application

176
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,870
and the LLM, I'm gonna call that an agent.

177
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,380
And you build those agents
in pretty abstracted ways

178
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,230
using these SDKs that make it easy.

179
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,030
For how like the requests and response

180
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,960
make it into that agent,

181
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,870
we've got a use case,
whether it's an agent

182
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,600
that's sitting inside some
chat bot architecture.

183
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,260
More commonly folks are
recognizing that the ability

184
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,640
to build like autonomous systems

185
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,593
that sit in part of business workflows,

186
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,070
and data architectures,

187
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,790
those inputs and outputs
might be the same types

188
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,800
of messages and events
that you prepackaged

189
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,020
from other upstream applications
and services you have,

190
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,310
but there's some notion

191
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,260
of like a request making it into

192
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,310
the docker container you built

193
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,770
and how that request is
gonna relate to the prompts

194
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,440
that are sent to the LLM
that's sitting at the center.

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
That agent application and
the SDK used to build it

196
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,270
has some mechanisms
for that agent software

197
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,863
to interact with dependencies.

198
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,280
Maybe the next biggest advancement

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,310
that's made building
agent applications easier

200
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,660
is the emergence of MCP just
about 12 months ago this month,

201
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,660
I think when that standard
was first released

202
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,520
and really like, matured to the point

203
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,100
of being adoptable in an
enterprise production landscape

204
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,350
just maybe seven months,
six, seven months ago

205
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,560
as the authentication
story matured a little bit.

206
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,770
So now we have like a docker application,

207
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,110
a bunch of new software capabilities

208
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,940
on how to interact with models,

209
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,560
but then a pretty standardized way

210
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,657
to make requests out to what
our dependencies might be.

211
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:52,620
And those dependencies can
be software applications,

212
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,660
they can be databases, data resources,

213
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,890
document repositories,
all exposed via like

214
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,100
a standard integration protocol and MCP

215
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,260
that uses service-oriented mechanisms

216
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,230
like folks are used to.

217
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,960
There may be other agents
that it's interacting with

218
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,390
via protocols like A2A.

219
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,340
Those MCP servers that you're writing

220
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,990
may be the integration mechanisms

221
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,390
for integrating with those agents too.

222
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,760
So you've got a couple
different options for

223
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,580
integrating with agents and collectively

224
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:27,690
you have a story here that feels like

225
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,850
a service-oriented
architecture, hopefully.

226
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,110
We've got docker containers,

227
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,580
we've got integration mechanisms,

228
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,880
we've got the ability
for defining dependencies

229
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
and how they interact with each other

230
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,410
and sit in the context of
some business use case.

231
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,030
To me it feels like,

232
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,310
that feels like
service-oriented architecture.

233
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,030
So everybody here should
be encouraged, I believe,

234
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,820
that the way in which agentic applications

235
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,670
are truly being built and developed

236
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,980
has tons of symmetry to the same types

237
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,380
of systems we've been
building for decades.

238
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,690
And so I'll talk in a
minute about different

239
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,160
service-oriented architecture principles

240
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,630
that still largely apply.

241
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,060
There's a lot of net-new
patterns that are emerging

242
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,160
and technologies, it seems like

243
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,820
every week there's new
libraries that are going viral

244
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,490
and new capabilities that are
being announced and launched.

245
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,400
And just know that as
much as it feels like

246
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,290
our heads can spin at
the speed of innovation

247
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,210
that's occurring right now.

248
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,200
Software engineers,
technology builders have been

249
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,180
building muscles at adapting

250
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,250
and remaining flexible in the patterns

251
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,520
that you're embedding into your designs

252
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,750
for years and years and years.

253
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,750
And all of those muscles for
you all and for the builders,

254
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,430
I think sets us up as an
audience to take advantage

255
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,230
of these technologies
rather than necessarily

256
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,030
just be disrupted by them.

257
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,020
It sets us up nicely.

258
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,590
So take confidence in that premise.

259
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,170
And then lastly, don't forget
non-functional requirements.

260
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,450
We've seen somebody that talks to

261
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,890
hundreds of customers throughout the year

262
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,240
and what they want to do with agents

263
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,880
and how they've been building so far,

264
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,470
the amount of like technical magic

265
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,730
that feels like is occurring

266
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,090
as folks build these systems,
lends itself to being,

267
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,950
it's very easy to forget the things like

268
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,330
operational excellence and
security and resilience

269
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,890
are things that don't come for free

270
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,630
that they need to be intentionally built

271
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,650
into the designs that you have,

272
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,330
and there are a lot of folks

273
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,280
that I think would attend
a session like this

274
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,920
have probably been that
voice in the room in the past

275
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,000
while building systems that
know things like scalability

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,150
are important to include
into the design upfront

277
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,020
in the design thinking.

278
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,260
So all of that, all of
those tendencies you have

279
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,180
as a builder are gonna lend themselves

280
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,530
to making you really valuable

281
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,493
as agent applications are
being built and developed.

282
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,490
Okay, so let's talk about
some design principles.

283
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,460
So on these next set of
slides, there's gonna be

284
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,000
kind of an evolution of some
principles and terminology

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,350
that hopefully folks are

286
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,320
largely familiar with
and how they would apply

287
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,470
in like an API-based distributed system

288
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,970
and the design principles that apply.

289
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,160
And then we're gonna
talk about some new ones

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,240
that we'll try and explain
in a set of like terminology

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,480
that maybe will like, feel more familiar

292
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,030
like in the lexicon of
building distributed systems,

293
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,250
but are new things you need to consider

294
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,280
inside of building agentic systems.

295
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,430
So here's a set of
equivalent design principles

296
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,330
I'm gonna say,

297
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,860
when you're building agentic systems

298
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,750
versus all the distributed systems

299
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,890
you've built historically.

300
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,110
So loose coupling still totally applies.

301
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,120
How you deploy those docker containers,

302
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,013
how you think about like the,

303
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,970
the benefits of things like
asynchronous processing

304
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,900
of like having no shared
concerns between systems,

305
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,330
being able to scale various aspects

306
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,820
of a distributed system independently.

307
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,150
The way in which an
agentic use case is gonna

308
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,620
sit inside the architecture.

309
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,690
All of those principles still apply

310
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,330
in very, very much the same way.

311
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,550
For modularity, I think this is one

312
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,650
where we've seen a tendency

313
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,870
to build anti-patterns in
the space inside of agents

314
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,700
compared to service-oriented architecture.

315
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,350
So rather than having
agents that are expected

316
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,940
to handle a lot of various different tasks

317
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,640
and context within the same use case,

318
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,160
all be built as part of the same set

319
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,100
of prompts, systems instructions

320
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,023
that you're gonna deliver
to a particular use case.

321
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:25,290
The ability to think of agent granularity

322
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,860
much in the same way as you
think about service granularity

323
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,080
as you're building microservices

324
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,030
and service-oriented architectures,

325
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,280
the same types of trade-offs exist.

326
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,910
So if you have a use case
where it's like very logical

327
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,180
how you might break down
those tasks along different

328
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,070
business logic lines or ownership lines

329
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,470
or security segmentation,

330
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,180
the same types of
benefits you'd have gotten

331
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,560
when building services in that way,

332
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,990
you'll get from building
multi-agent systems

333
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,840
in that same way.

334
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,820
On the flip side of having modular agents,

335
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,950
making the tools that you build reusable.

336
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,280
So reusability and having the ability for

337
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,440
a rest service satisfy the requirements

338
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,020
of many different clients
that are integrating with it.

339
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,990
You want to build your
components of tooling,

340
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,560
your MCP servers with that
same kind of mindset in mind

341
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,650
where if you have like a retail context,

342
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,040
and you've got an MCP server
that's talking to your,

343
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,910
your order history systems
and exposing information

344
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,490
about past transactions and
orders that have been placed.

345
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,220
If you have various
different agents within

346
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,760
a customer support context and
the E-commerce buying context

347
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,290
and the fulfillment context all
having their own MCP servers

348
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,400
that talk to the same set

349
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,320
of eventual backend sources of truth,

350
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,240
you're gonna find yourself
in the same types of

351
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,370
lack of consistency and problems

352
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,203
that would've emerged

353
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:52,020
in a service-oriented landscape before.

354
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,670
So having your tools and MCP servers

355
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,750
be built in a reusable way,

356
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,580
and being built by like the appropriate

357
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,670
business line domains that
own those topics today.

358
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,860
We've seen like more of a pattern emerge

359
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,250
where the agents that are being built

360
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,840
are often very use-case oriented

361
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,820
and sit close to the
edge of an organization,

362
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,590
and they're building
MCP tools for themselves

363
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,690
that their own agents need and
they're building the proxies

364
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,830
between their own agents

365
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,080
and the backend architectures

366
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,580
that they need to integrate with.

367
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,830
And we find it's much more efficient

368
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,740
and scalable over the long term to instead

369
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,380
think of the MCP server
as like an extension

370
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,760
of the service integration mechanism

371
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,750
for those sources of truth

372
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,210
that different agents
are gonna integrate with.

373
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,150
Okay, discoverability.

374
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,430
Just like you'd have
service registries and

375
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,840
copious documentation about

376
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,850
what the different capabilities are

377
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,010
of a particular distributed
system and service or API,

378
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,530
you want agents to have the
same type of capability.

379
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,330
It should be obvious to anybody

380
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,620
who's meant to interact with an agent

381
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,600
or part of a technology team

382
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,580
that is meant to integrate

383
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,650
with an agentic system that you've built

384
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,110
or a developer that's being
onboarded into your organization

385
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,180
to have a very clear understanding

386
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,640
of what the intended boundaries are

387
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,080
for an agent that you've built, right?

388
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,400
And the good news is a lot

389
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,650
of these things are a
little more self-evident

390
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,330
when building agents to humans

391
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,850
than building APIs in the past.

392
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,040
There's a lot of stuff
we do in natural language

393
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,010
when building agents that
make it a little easier

394
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,690
to be discoverable.

395
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,970
But the same general concept applies

396
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,130
that as you're building agents,

397
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,250
the need to maintain like
team-wide, department-wide,

398
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,060
company-wide catalogs of
where those agents are

399
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,520
and like what their
capabilities are meant to do,

400
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,280
how to integrate with them,
documentation for them,

401
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,230
where the observability
points are for them.

402
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,700
All of those things apply

403
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,680
to agent systems just like you would have

404
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,105
when you're building
service-oriented architectures.

405
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,150
So now let's talk about
a couple principles,

406
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,130
a few principles that I'm gonna say

407
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,110
have evolved a little bit.

408
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,283
Still like,

409
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,500
like at their core there's

410
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,180
there's ways in which
the knowledge you have

411
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,400
about a prior principle
in service-oriented design

412
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,360
is gonna like transition
naturally into the new world.

413
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,110
But there's a little nuance or
a way that some contradiction

414
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,870
might have emerged that you
need to take into account.

415
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,390
So the benefits of statelessness

416
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,540
in service-oriented design
have been well understood

417
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,380
for a really long time.

418
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,810
The benefits that gives you to resilience

419
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,720
and scalability like deployment safety,

420
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,580
having as much statelessness

421
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,070
embedded in an architecture as possible

422
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,760
was always a practical
thing to strive for.

423
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,160
But now we know in agent applications

424
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,220
having persistent contextual memory

425
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,373
across multi-turn
conversations potentially,

426
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:45,300
or use cases within workflows
that require multiple turns,

427
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,310
having contextual memory be embedded

428
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,911
as part of the context window

429
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:52,770
for the agent that's performing the tasks

430
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,390
or achieving the goals that you define.

431
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,490
This is an important part of
getting the most capability

432
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,230
as you can out of an agent.

433
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,320
So there's elements of
the data architecture,

434
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,590
the memory in particular
that is gonna feel,

435
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,270
it might feel a little unnatural

436
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,910
as like a distributed systems
builder coming from the past

437
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,520
to be comfortable with the idea that

438
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,380
the runtime application of an agent

439
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,160
is gonna have a lot of, like,

440
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,140
you can think of it as session state,

441
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,240
but conversation state and memory

442
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,973
be building within the same use case,

443
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,360
the same runtime
infrastructure that's deployed.

444
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,310
And that adds a couple
different dimensions

445
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,360
that you need to be conscious of.

446
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,420
It means that

447
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,500
as memory gets embedded

448
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,940
in these multi-term conversations,

449
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,200
that things like scalability

450
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,360
and deployment safety
across like when users

451
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,890
are in the middle of having a conversation

452
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,790
or work is in the midst of being done,

453
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,940
what that means for your use case,

454
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,040
the idea if you were gonna
disrupt a multi-term conversation

455
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,263
in the midst of it happening

456
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,500
and what the user experience
is meant to look like,

457
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,700
while that's happening in real time.

458
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,730
Next, let's talk about
orchestration versus

459
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,500
autonomous coordination.

460
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,890
So still, like the idea
of building logical graphs

461
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,710
and the types of work that should occur

462
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,840
and understanding what the dependency flow

463
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,110
and structure looks like for
the architecture you build,

464
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,820
those things were very deterministic

465
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,750
and able to be documented
and understand at design time

466
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,350
in the world of distributed systems

467
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,150
and using capabilities like step functions

468
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,150
from us and other like
graph-based workflow platforms.

469
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,380
But with agents you have the ability

470
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,620
to let the coordination emerge at runtime

471
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,650
as the type of non-deterministic work

472
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,750
that you might want to take advantage of,

473
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,240
it's possible for there
to be multiple use cases

474
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,070
that a single agent
system is gonna satisfy.

475
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,620
And depending on the type
of request that comes in

476
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,640
and the context for it,

477
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,590
you may have different
specialized agents downstream

478
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,270
that handle different components of it.

479
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,580
So understanding like how coordination

480
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,660
is meant to relate to each other

481
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,120
and how that coordination is described

482
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,670
and how to allow it to emerge at runtime

483
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,670
versus just defining it
in a very discreet way.

484
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,320
And you have trade-offs here you can make,

485
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,720
and Dan's portion of the conversation,

486
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,600
there may be use cases where
you want more determinism

487
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,770
in the workflow that you're building

488
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,700
and you don't want a lot of
like emerged coordination

489
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,140
that's more autonomous

490
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,080
and non-deterministic at a macro level.

491
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,710
And you can combine some
of the principles here

492
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,787
with the principles you know,

493
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,037
and the patterns you have

494
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,890
from service-oriented architecture,

495
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,830
like patterns of the past
that will still apply.

496
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,773
So next service contracts
and capability emergence,

497
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,710
like has been fundamentally important

498
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,080
and like good API design

499
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,520
to understand like the concepts
of backward compatibility

500
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,780
and like client-server
relationship at the contract level,

501
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,250
and what the different data elements were

502
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,070
and like the allowed values

503
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,940
and like ranges of those
values was a key part

504
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,490
of what allowed
service-oriented architectures

505
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,920
to proliferate and be stable.

506
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,470
But in the world of agents,

507
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,940
capability can emerge at runtime.

508
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,070
And it's a benefit of it.

509
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,140
The idea that as like tools change

510
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,970
and capabilities are deployed,

511
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,620
you don't have to update
layers of your agentic stack

512
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,940
in order to expose those things

513
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,810
and expect the agent to
like evolve its behavior

514
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,790
through coding changes you've made.

515
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,670
As those tools, descriptions
and capabilities

516
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,190
emerge over time, the agent
will discover them at runtime

517
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,010
and it will allow new capability to emerge

518
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,900
as tools are built and as they change

519
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,770
and as capabilities are released,
those things can emerge,

520
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,213
can emerge in real time.

521
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm gonna call it totally
new design principles

522
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,753
that folks need to get comfortable with.

523
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,540
Software engineers often joke

524
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,300
that a lot of what our
career has boiled down to

525
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,190
has been building crud,

526
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,620
you know, building, create,
read, update, delete,

527
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,440
and a million different business contexts.

528
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,510
But in the end, if you're
talking about business logic,

529
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,240
there's some way in which
the code you're working on

530
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,530
on any given day is gonna boil down

531
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,330
to building some form of crud

532
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,760
related to some type of
business domain object

533
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,980
or technical domain object.

534
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,120
And that meant that helps
ground your design thinking

535
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,620
and the patterns that you're gonna build,

536
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,970
and things are very different now.

537
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,580
And the way in which you think about

538
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,890
like how to prioritize what
use cases are a good fit

539
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,400
and what models are gonna be
like practically applied to,

540
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,370
you need to pivot your design thinking

541
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,680
to this idea of goals, that goals are

542
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,130
like the new unit of
technical work being done

543
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,420
rather than crud.

544
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,280
And if you can distill the type of

545
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,530
value you want your
software system to deliver

546
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,210
to your business or your customers

547
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,900
in the context of a very
succinctly describable goal,

548
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,090
there's a good chance that
a model will understand

549
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,158
the work that you're trying to achieve,

550
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,128
and you'll get a better idea of like

551
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:03,808
what data and what context
needs to be delivered

552
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:05,580
into that model to achieve the goal.

553
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,660
Reasoning transparency.

554
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,860
So the whole idea of reasoning

555
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,590
as like a deployable piece of technology

556
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,870
is fundamentally new on its own,

557
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,400
but it means that observability

558
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
is fundamentally different too.

559
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,390
The logs that we used to gather

560
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,670
needed to only include a lot of metadata

561
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,470
about the actions that were taken,

562
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,850
metadata about those actions,

563
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,210
the events that occurred
within the sequence of code,

564
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,600
so timestamps and like where
elements of code were executed,

565
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,260
and now there's this
non-deterministic ability for software

566
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,100
to think inside of your architecture

567
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,790
and being able to think
about how you want to ingest

568
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,920
that observability into an architecture

569
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,950
and use it thoughtfully when
you have operational reasons

570
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,310
to review it or analyze it or debug it.

571
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,570
So having a good set of ideas

572
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:56,850
of how reasoning transparency
and the evidence of it

573
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,121
is part of your operational pipelines,

574
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:03,570
and architectures is a key new thing

575
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,030
that you need to think about,

576
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,380
building other distributed systems

577
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,990
to ingest in the process
and things like that.

578
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,983
Self-correction.

579
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,010
There's tons of patterns
like circuit breaker

580
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,200
and others where error handling

581
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,440
and fault handling has been
a large portion of what

582
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,170
can make distributed systems reliable.

583
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,820
Agents have like a general
tendency to want to self-correct

584
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,700
and find ways to achieve
their goal via multiple paths.

585
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,650
And there may be times where
this is a big benefit for you

586
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,360
and there's other times where you may not

587
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,340
want an agent to take advantage of this.

588
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,610
So having a very explicit understanding

589
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,160
that at build time at like the definition

590
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,040
of the agentic system you're
designing and deploying,

591
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,750
that this tendency exists

592
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,280
inside of the agent you're building

593
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,370
and what it might mean, the
different error scenarios are

594
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,210
that we'll encounter,

595
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,460
whether it be like a tool is unavailable

596
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,540
or like access changes occur
that limit its capability

597
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,970
and how an agent may react to those things

598
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,190
and what would you want its behavior to be

599
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,180
in those scenarios?

600
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,890
And to take those things into account

601
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,140
as you're building your instructions,

602
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,680
designing your downstream
dependency architectures

603
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,960
and all of those things is net-new work

604
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,980
that you should be thinking about

605
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,290
as a service-oriented builder.

606
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,810
And then lastly, like
maybe most fundamentally

607
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,960
is this idea of
non-determinism in general,

608
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,990
understanding that the type of testing

609
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,860
that you're able to do,

610
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,470
we just announced this
morning AgentCore evaluations,

611
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,420
which can play a huge role here.

612
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,950
There's ways in which
that fundamental premise

613
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,570
that the software work being done

614
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,480
is gonna be non-deterministic,
is gonna change

615
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,600
a lot of the typical ways

616
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,050
in which you've achieved some
operationally-related goals

617
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,770
for agentic systems compared
to how you worked before.

618
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,770
Okay, now I'm gonna just
gonna run through things

619
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,000
that hopefully if you're in the session,

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,370
you understand these services
are available already,

621
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,580
but I've mentioned Strands a little bit

622
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,510
a couple times already,

623
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,850
but AWS's mindset here

624
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,700
is like adopt an agent
framework in general.

625
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,220
Don't feel like you need to write software

626
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,640
that's gonna integrate with
all your models out of the box

627
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,740
in some sophisticated way
without taking advantage

628
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,760
of the SDKs on the market,

629
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,700
and Strands, we think it was
released at a very neat time

630
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,910
where the model capabilities
and their ability to reason

631
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,140
really advanced to the point

632
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,030
where it let us build an SDK that hit

633
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:28,960
a really nice sweet spot
on making the ability

634
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,450
to develop quickly and
reach production quickly

635
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,730
at the like the appropriate
level of traction

636
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,310
that leans into the model's capabilities

637
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,950
to reason without a lot of
like design time complexity,

638
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,530
but still a ton of robust operational

639
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,630
and security benefits that
you get from using it too,

640
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,870
so choosing the right agent SDK.

641
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,630
For like building and
authoring the code related

642
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,340
to everything I've described so far,

643
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,790
We have the KIRO CLI and the KIRO IDE.

644
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,620
You have the ability to adopt cloud code,

645
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,230
you can have your model
inference for the cloud models

646
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,940
behind cloud code get deployed on Bedrock.

647
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,310
If you're a team that
manages like model governance

648
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,570
and access inside your enterprise

649
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,430
and you like the Bedrock model of that,

650
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,930
you can have cloud code be
backed by a Bedrock model.

651
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,660
And so many of the things like as you

652
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,640
as software engineers are
learning these things,

653
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,800
there's new capabilities that are gonna

654
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,180
help you author the software

655
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,650
and produce it for you without you

656
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,710
having to get down to that
level of detail yourself.

657
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,590
And then obviously
Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

658
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,380
as you more and more are
gonna be responsible for

659
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,960
understanding like the
high level translation

660
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,990
between business requirements into

661
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,780
the prompting and
co-development you're gonna do

662
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,980
with agentic systems,

663
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,640
having an infrastructure
platform like AgentCore Runtime

664
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,790
that extracts as much as it can

665
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,130
on the infrastructure
side in a serverless way,

666
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,630
and give you a lot of confidence

667
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,510
that like the AWS reputation from

668
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,950
operational excellence and security

669
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,350
are gonna be embedded in that story

670
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,180
is gonna like help you accelerate

671
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,770
and get to production more quickly.

672
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,300
And then I just want to call out here

673
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,520
that the AgentCore Runtime

674
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,920
where the docker containers
get deployed can also be

675
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,690
your MCP servers that you build as well.

676
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,980
So all the different
tools that you might build

677
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,860
for your agents deploying
to AgentCore Runtime

678
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,990
is a place those MCP servers
can be deployed as well.

679
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,120
Okay, so that's all the
general kind of overview

680
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,200
that I'm gonna provide you today.

681
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,840
I'm gonna pivot over
to Dan and Dan from WEX

682
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,480
is gonna come up and talk to
you about their experience

683
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,580
building agents as a company.

684
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,413
- Thank you.

685
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,930
Am I on? All right.

686
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,580
Good afternoon everybody.

687
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,630
My name's Dan DeLauro,

688
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,950
I'm a Solutions Architect

689
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,080
on the cloud engineering team at WEX.

690
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,273
And let me change my slide here.

691
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,353
There we go.

692
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,620
It's the right button, sorry about that.

693
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,780
So last year I was
sitting out there, right,

694
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,670
and I was in a session just like this

695
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,460
and I was hearing about
Bedrock and agentic

696
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,130
and all these new tools that
make it look really easy

697
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,090
to build with AI,

698
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,300
but it always kind of felt a
little bit out of reach, right?

699
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,610
Like Andrew, I'm no data scientist,

700
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,710
I don't have a background
in machine learning

701
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,240
and I'm not building neural networks,

702
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,830
but I didn't need any of that

703
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,800
because honestly, as
builders, all of us, right?

704
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,460
As people who understand
systems and patterns

705
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,430
and architecture, we've
actually got an advantage.

706
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,590
And that's kind of what
prepared me for all that.

707
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,700
Like the building part though,

708
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,770
like this speaking thing is new,

709
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,960
that's a new thing for me, but I'm here.

710
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,790
So thanks for coming out.

711
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,440
Today, I'd like to talk about how

712
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,120
we've been using Bedrock agents

713
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,120
and now AgentCore to enrich
our operational support at WEX.

714
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,162
And I think you'll see
a lot of the principles

715
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:36,570
and a lot of the things that
Andrew covered, they're there,

716
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,760
and they're kind of what
made that possible for us.

717
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,430
And they're really what
helped us go from pilot

718
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,560
to production in under three months.

719
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,860
And now we've got well
over 2000 users internally,

720
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,080
so it's been a good year.

721
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,180
But first we've got the company slide.

722
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,950
In case you don't know who we are,

723
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,230
WEX is a global commerce platform.

724
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,980
We power mobility, benefits,
and payment solutions

725
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,370
for organizations in
more than 200 countries.

726
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,110
We operate one of the world's largest

727
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,880
proprietary fleet networks,

728
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,760
and we help consumers manage
their benefits accounts,

729
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,930
things like HSAs and
FSAs and LSAs and COBRA.

730
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,120
And we handle everything
from corporate travel

731
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,940
to expense management, all with the goal

732
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,640
of simplifying the business
of running a business.

733
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,460
Last year we processed over
$230 billion in transactions

734
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,900
in more than 20 different currencies.

735
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,340
So it kind of goes without saying, right?

736
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,700
Our platforms need to be
reliable, they need to be secure,

737
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,920
and they have to run at scale.

738
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,560
And that's where Global
Technology Services comes in.

739
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,780
Now we're sort of the
team behind the teams.

740
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,390
We designed the shared services that drive

741
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,720
platform engineering standards,
reliability, governance,

742
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,540
cost optimization, all the paved roads

743
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,070
that let everybody move really fast

744
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,930
without getting into trouble.

745
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,970
My team's job at WEX, sorry,

746
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,513
is to make cloud feel
simple even when it isn't.

747
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,350
And last year Global Technology

748
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,440
saw more than 40,000 support requests.

749
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,910
Now that's a lot, right?

750
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,740
But if you think about it,

751
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,290
every last one of them
is critical to somebody,

752
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,070
even if they are repetitive
and time consuming for us.

753
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,560
And we've got operations and we've got SRE

754
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,720
and support at all of those tiers,

755
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,050
but we're always looking for
ways to reduce that number

756
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,520
without reducing quality.

757
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,520
So like everyone else,
we started looking at AI,

758
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,460
but we didn't want to do
anything flashy or complicated.

759
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,470
We just wanted to start small

760
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,550
and build something simple

761
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,923
that would just quietly
make our lives easier.

762
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,720
And that's what inspired
us to build ChatGTS.

763
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,250
And in case you don't
see what we did there,

764
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,820
GTS is just short for
Global Technology Services.

765
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,760
It's kind of got a ring to it, right?

766
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,080
But anyways, I promise

767
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,690
there's more to this than a chatbot story.

768
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,180
Sure it can chat, it lives in our chat,

769
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,080
it can read our documentation
and it'll do Q and A all day.

770
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,270
But underneath it's evolving

771
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,610
into more of a virtual engineer,

772
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,460
one that understands cloud and network

773
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,980
and security and operations.

774
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,280
But we're not replacing people,

775
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,120
we're just doing what we do in operations.

776
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,100
We're automating the repetitive stuff

777
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,010
and we're expanding our
self-service capabilities.

778
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,320
Really, we're just
trying to free people up

779
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,870
so they can focus on the
problems that matter,

780
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,320
the ones that actually
move the business forward.

781
00:32:26,054 --> 00:32:28,860
But we had to start somewhere, right?

782
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,510
We didn't want to just build
agents because we could,

783
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,840
or get stuck in that cycle
of chasing shiny objects

784
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,640
whenever something new came out.

785
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,640
So we looked at our data,
our support history,

786
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,410
and those 40,000 tickets,

787
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,880
and then we asked ourselves

788
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,920
what are we seeing the most, right?

789
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,460
Which are the most complex
or just flat out painful?

790
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,950
Really, where are we
spending the most time?

791
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,240
And then we looked at the places

792
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,910
where we had existing
automation or runbooks

793
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,140
or some kind of a process

794
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,270
that people were already executing,

795
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,580
and we realized that was the sweet spot,

796
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,540
that high volume, high
friction, well understood work,

797
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,040
that's where we knew we
could make a dent with AI.

798
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,090
And I brought two examples to share today,

799
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,100
but keep in mind we did start with chat

800
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,450
and we focused on Q and A

801
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,790
so that we could build
up our knowledge base.

802
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,680
And we saw immediately,

803
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,650
now instead of opening a ticket
just to find information,

804
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,410
people were able to come
and find it on their own.

805
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,350
And we were building
agents that could leverage

806
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,810
that knowledge base to
make their own decisions.

807
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,660
So that was sort of like
setting the foundation

808
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,480
and laying the platform for all of this.

809
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,313
But now,

810
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,150
this first example is honestly
my least favorite ticket,

811
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,920
and hopefully some of
you will understand why

812
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,753
when we get to it.

813
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:47,040
But the second one is
a little more exciting

814
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,930
because we're moving beyond chat,

815
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,900
and we're embracing event-driven
design with AgentCore.

816
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,030
But together, I think they show

817
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,420
how AI can really become
a part of operations,

818
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,530
not a side project,

819
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,653
but more like a teammate
who's always on call.

820
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,970
So can anybody relate to this?

821
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,650
Has anyone ever had a network issue

822
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,850
they've had a troubleshoot?

823
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,293
Well, I know you do, right?

824
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,930
Well, consider yourself lucky,

825
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,980
because at WEX we operate
hundreds of AWS accounts,

826
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,060
and we've got Azure and Google
all spanning eight regions

827
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,830
and multiple on-prem data centers,

828
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,810
and it's all interconnected.

829
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,940
Now you probably know
there's a lot of tech

830
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,920
that goes into making that possible.

831
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,610
So when something inevitably
fails, it can be challenging.

832
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,740
Even with the right tools, it's hard.

833
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,680
So picture this, it's almost noon,

834
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,120
you're getting ready to go to lunch

835
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,250
and you get a ping in your support chat,

836
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,590
and it's Jared from the
PAS engineering team,

837
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,570
and he's like, dude, we're blocked.

838
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,070
We're trying to deploy this cluster

839
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,420
and we're in this new VPC

840
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,180
and we're expecting it to
reach all these things.

841
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,090
Now, Jared doesn't have access
to the transit gateways,

842
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,890
or the firewalls or the VPNs,

843
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,300
and even if he did,

844
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,830
maybe it's a little out of his wheelhouse,

845
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,750
but that's not his job, right?

846
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,620
You know that feeling.

847
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,910
You like Jared,

848
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,930
you don't want leave him hanging,

849
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,520
but you want to go to lunch.

850
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,660
Now you almost,

851
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,510
it's like you don't have a
choice, you have to respond.

852
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,970
Well now you don't
because we built an agent

853
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,470
that can respond for you.

854
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,410
And now what used to require
all this tribal knowledge

855
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,910
across all these different domains,

856
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,320
it can happen in minutes

857
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,680
and anyone can use it now, even Jared.

858
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,330
Now in this example,

859
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,600
it's an EKS cluster and the
agent knows it's an AWS,

860
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,120
and it could go into
our core network account

861
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,950
and it can use reachability analyzer.

862
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,770
So it provisions a network analysis path,

863
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,120
and we know that takes a while.

864
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,770
So while that's running,

865
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,260
it fans out and it checks flow logs,

866
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,360
it looks at any recent
changes in the network,

867
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,490
and then it looks to see if
there's any known issues, right?

868
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,650
There could be something
already happening.

869
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,970
But by the time it's done,

870
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,920
it's collected all of this information

871
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,780
from all of the things it's looked into,

872
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,640
and it breaks it down in natural language

873
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,430
and presents it to you,
the end user, in chat.

874
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,970
And it shows you exactly where
that traffic dropped and why.

875
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,580
So now when Jared needs to escalate,

876
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,320
he can do it with the right team

877
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,630
and all of the right information.

878
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,000
And since we're logging all
of these investigations,

879
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,920
we're able to spot recurring issues

880
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,560
and maybe we identify opportunities

881
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,800
for some tighter
guardrails in the network.

882
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,410
But at the end of the day,
this is a perfect example

883
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,223
of how an agentic system can
scale maybe where humans can't.

884
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,510
Now, the second one is my current favorite

885
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,130
because you know, like I said,

886
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,170
this was more than a chat bot.

887
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,740
Now we're building agents
that are responding to alerts

888
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,230
and anomalies, and they're understanding

889
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,380
the state of a system before
they're deciding how to react.

890
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,660
They're not just hanging
out waiting for a ping.

891
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,180
And honestly, this is the best kind of AI

892
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,150
because you don't even
realize you're using it.

893
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,710
And we all love EKS, right?

894
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,750
Containers, they're gonna
solve all our problems

895
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,880
and you know it's gonna save the world,

896
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,010
but they're not always the answer.

897
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,350
Now, don't judge, but at WEX,

898
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,060
we've still got some critical workloads

899
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,730
that just make more sense running on EC2,

900
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,430
but we still have to support them.

901
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,360
So picture this, you've got
an EBS spike out of nowhere,

902
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,800
your CloudWatch lights up

903
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,080
and you can almost smell the smoke right?

904
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,090
Now, this could be a warning shot,

905
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,670
but why chance it if we
can get in front of it?

906
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,910
But if that workload matters,
someone's getting a page,

907
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,910
somebody's gotta wake
up, they gotta log in,

908
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,740
then they gotta figure
out what's happening,

909
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,060
where is it happening?

910
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,340
They're checking logs, maybe
they're running Playbooks

911
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,800
to expand the volume, or
maybe they're just topping on

912
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,240
and clearing some space.

913
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,850
Whatever they're doing, that takes time.

914
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,270
And let's be honest, nobody
wants to do that at 2:00 a.m.

915
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,530
I certainly don't.

916
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,750
And that's one of the
reasons we built this,

917
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,760
but it's the reality today.

918
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,030
So now we can flip the
script a little bit.

919
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,530
Take a sip of this real quick.

920
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,930
All right, so instead
of paging an engineer,

921
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,520
we can send these alerts to an agent

922
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
with all of those metrics and context.

923
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,630
So now we're not calling anybody,

924
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,920
we're not waking anyone up.

925
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,530
That's no longer that
first line of defense.

926
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,830
The agent can see what's
happening, where it's happening,

927
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,090
and it can find an agent

928
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,253
or a team of agents to
help with the issue.

929
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,600
Now, our first agent does some discovery.

930
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,800
This is like triage.

931
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,010
It looks at the operating
system, it looks at the version,

932
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,230
it looks to see which
platform it belongs to.

933
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,540
It looks to see how critical it is.

934
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,890
And then it looks at history.

935
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,380
It looks to see has this happened before?

936
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,473
How many times have we
expanded the volume here?

937
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:36,780
You know, we maintain policies
to cap expansion, right?

938
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,910
You don't want to just keep adding disc,

939
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,290
you're kicking the can down the road,

940
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,580
and that's never gonna work.

941
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,220
So at this point, if anything looks off

942
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,410
the agent steps out of the way

943
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,760
and we escalate back to a human

944
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,800
and then we're back to
the way we do it now.

945
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,680
But if not, our agent
can connect into Jira

946
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,320
through AgentCore Gateway
and it can open a ticket

947
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,120
and start logging the incident.

948
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,460
Now think about it, this analysis is huge

949
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,230
because you're collecting

950
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,750
all of the inputs you're
gonna need a week later

951
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,280
if it evolves to an incident

952
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,443
and you need to craft an RCA document.

953
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,250
So now that we know what's happening,

954
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,530
it passes on to a maintenance agent,

955
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,240
and this agent can choose

956
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,240
from a library of
preexisting SSM documents.

957
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,760
Now, keep in mind, these
are the same documents

958
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,520
that our ops engineers
are using at 2:00 a.m.

959
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,370
We've got Playbooks to
run diagnostics and backup

960
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,900
and cleanup and expansion.

961
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,880
It's all the usual runbooks,

962
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,500
but we've exposed them as tools

963
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,110
to the agent on an MCP server.

964
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,960
So now whatever the agent decides to do,

965
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
it's using the same automations
that we already trust,

966
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,920
and we're not waking somebody
up to push that run button.

967
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,250
We've eliminated the chats,
the texts, the pages,

968
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,830
the cross team escalations,

969
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,200
and now these systems,
they're starting to learn

970
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,750
how to take care of each other.

971
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,960
And as they learn,
they're building memory.

972
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,350
And over time they can
start to recognize patterns.

973
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,960
Now we can learn where we're starting to,

974
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,870
we're cleaning up on occasion
where we have to escalate

975
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,430
and maybe they start to spot issues

976
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,170
at the application layer.

977
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,470
Now, that's what makes this
feel less like automation,

978
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,490
and more like a team.

979
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,173
This gets smarter over time.

980
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,790
And once the issue is resolved,

981
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,980
we can update Jira
through AgentCore Gateway,

982
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,760
and then we can publish status
to SNS through an MCP server.

983
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,330
And from here we can notify
engineers, on-call systems,

984
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,880
dashboards, whatever else
is downstream from there.

985
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,630
But we're not done yet.

986
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,360
This same agent is gonna
follow that resource

987
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,090
all the way upstream back to the Terraform

988
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,760
or the cloud formation
or whoever or whatever

989
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,410
built in in the first place.

990
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,240
And it's gonna open a pull request,

991
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,690
or it's gonna create a Jira
issue, or send an email.

992
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,210
It's gonna do something
that closes that loop

993
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,040
between operations and infrastructure,

994
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,840
so we can remediate that drift

995
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,150
we introduced in the incident.

996
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,050
Now, I'm gonna be honest, I've
been doing this a long time

997
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,340
and I've seen some cool stuff,

998
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,820
but when I see stuff
like this work for real,

999
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,720
the first couple of times

1000
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,970
I still kind of feel like a little kid.

1001
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,857
It feels like magic, right?

1002
00:41:13,857 --> 00:41:16,770
And I just hope it sparks some ideas

1003
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,770
and inspires, to see what's possible

1004
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,890
when you think about
applying AI to operations,

1005
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,930
I know this is a basic example,

1006
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,340
we're just expanding a volume here,

1007
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,780
but we're just getting started.

1008
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,140
This is us learning how to
use what we already know,

1009
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,570
and we're reusing what already works.

1010
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,140
It's not magic, it's just
engineering and architecture.

1011
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,590
And that's kind of the point.

1012
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,820
So I'm gonna zoom out,

1013
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,830
I'm gonna talk a little
bit about how we got there,

1014
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,300
and then we can look at some diagrams,

1015
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,060
we'll see what it looks
like under the hood.

1016
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,910
So when we started this, we knew we wanted

1017
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,350
to build more than a chat bot
and a rag pipeline, right?

1018
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,850
We wanted to create a platform.

1019
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,090
We wanted something sustainable,
something extensible,

1020
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,970
something that would inspire
all of the other teams to come

1021
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,220
and collaborate and help us expand this,

1022
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,040
because operations takes a village.

1023
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,440
But we didn't have to change
the way we built things.

1024
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,320
We just had to let these old
patterns breathe a little bit.

1025
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,820
And it was all the same stuff.

1026
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:17,730
You know, we built agents with boundaries,

1027
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,590
we gave them clear responsibilities,

1028
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,050
and we let them all work independently.

1029
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,450
And we saw guardrails become the contracts

1030
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,630
for what those agents
could and couldn't do.

1031
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,740
And events, it became less
about, something happened,

1032
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,740
and more about, here's what
happened, here's what it means,

1033
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,670
here's what we can do,

1034
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,370
and here's what we did
the last time it happened.

1035
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,470
And of course, observability, right?

1036
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,030
We still need to see everything,

1037
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,660
but there's more to this
than 200s and 500s now.

1038
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,150
We're looking at behavior and reasoning.

1039
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,620
There's nothing new though.

1040
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,053
It all translates and it
all still makes sense.

1041
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,930
So here's what it looks like.

1042
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,640
Out of the gate, I'll be honest,
it was a little challenging

1043
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,510
because at WEX we don't use
Slack, we don't use Teams,

1044
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,870
we use Google Chat, and there
is no native integration

1045
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,350
between Google and AWS for collaboration.

1046
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,470
So on the left, left right,

1047
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,380
we have our users chatting with
us in our workspace domain.

1048
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,420
Now those requests come over the internet.

1049
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,910
So in the middle we have
our WAF, with Imperva,

1050
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,760
that secures our inbound traffic.

1051
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,830
And on the right we
have our AWS environment

1052
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,720
fronted by API gateway.

1053
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,310
And from there we use a Lambda

1054
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,560
to route and acknowledge messages.

1055
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,880
And then we use Step Functions

1056
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,980
to orchestrate all of our agents.

1057
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
We store state and
conversations in Dynamo,

1058
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,410
reasoning traces land in S3.

1059
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,260
And of course Bedrock hosts
our agents and knowledge.

1060
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,660
On paper it looks pretty simple.

1061
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,550
It's neat, it's easy, it's serverless,

1062
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,993
it's exactly what we wanted.

1063
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,130
Now our chat application is
only assigned to the users

1064
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,660
who are allowed to use it.

1065
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,000
And all of those messages
come with a signed token

1066
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,090
that we can validate, and
then it hits our router.

1067
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,750
And here we can filter out
noise, oversized prompts,

1068
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,570
and we can send a quick
response to that user,

1069
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,300
basically saying, hey, we
got it, we're working on it.

1070
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,850
And that helps sort of
absorb the model latency

1071
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,240
because agents still take
a while to do their work.

1072
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,550
But really at the front, at the edge,

1073
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,920
this is just a clean,
well-defined contract

1074
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,870
for everything else downstream,

1075
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,870
and it keeps our front door predictable.

1076
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,120
Now, I'll admit before this,

1077
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,868
I never really did much
with Step Functions.

1078
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:30,780
I know they're on all the exams

1079
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,830
and everybody has to learn 'em,

1080
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,170
but I always felt like
they were just for people

1081
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,000
who built too many Lambdas.

1082
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,750
But, it turns out they're
actually perfect for AI.

1083
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,090
You know, Bedrock gave
us the intelligence,

1084
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,750
the parts that can think and
create and make decisions.

1085
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,150
Step Functions gave us
the discipline we needed

1086
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,770
to keep it all in check.

1087
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,280
We used the retries and
fallbacks and state transitions,

1088
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,990
and that's where it really clicked.

1089
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,850
You know, like Andrew said, these agents,

1090
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:59,310
they can be autonomous,
but they don't have to be.

1091
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,780
You can give them as much freedom

1092
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,910
or as much control as you need to,

1093
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,930
and that's what made them fit

1094
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,243
so well in these operational workflows.

1095
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,940
So Google gives us a trusted identity,

1096
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,030
but it has no concept of permissions.

1097
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,250
That token really only tells us

1098
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,620
that you're allowed to talk to us.

1099
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,870
So we take that identity

1100
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,550
and we reach out to active directory

1101
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,760
and we fetch your entitlements
and cash them in Dynamo.

1102
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,050
Kept it pretty simple.

1103
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,327
It's all based on group
memberships and OU.

1104
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,460
And that way we're not
beating up on systems

1105
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,070
that were never really
meant for real time traffic.

1106
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,500
So basically Google tells us who you are.

1107
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,810
This is how we figure out
what you're allowed to do

1108
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,573
and how far you can go before
you ever reach an agent.

1109
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,740
And when we invoke that agent,

1110
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,320
we wrap the entire prompt in context tags,

1111
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,780
and we include your identity
and your entitlements

1112
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,060
and send that downstream to the agent.

1113
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,160
So now whatever the user claims,

1114
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,760
the agent only trusts that
context because it's immutable.

1115
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,480
And here, if something goes
sideways, say the agent fails

1116
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,090
or times out or can't produce a response,

1117
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,520
we log the error and we can
send a safe response back

1118
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,223
to the user without blowing
up the whole workflow.

1119
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,130
Now, once the agent responds,
we want to capture everything.

1120
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,600
We store messages in Dynamo
and trace traces in S3,

1121
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,970
and from there we format the response,

1122
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,440
so it looks good in chat.

1123
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,540
You know, Google has their
own markdown language,

1124
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,440
and that allows us to include
citations and reference links

1125
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,360
and any attachments that came back.

1126
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,640
And then we update that temporary message

1127
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,020
we send from the router.

1128
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,330
And that really, that takes what feels

1129
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,920
like a request response

1130
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,080
and it turns it into
more of a transaction.

1131
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,000
It's more like an actual conversation.

1132
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,450
And that's kind of the point.

1133
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,600
So really that's how
Step Functions helped us.

1134
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,370
It gave us this structure

1135
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,590
where there was so much
potential for chaos.

1136
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,780
And it's all the same patterns, right?

1137
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,750
There's retries and fallbacks
and circuit breakers,

1138
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,300
and it's baked into
every state transition.

1139
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,870
That helped us hold all of these
creative parts accountable.

1140
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,460
And now we can observe it,

1141
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,010
and we can measure it just
like any other workflow.

1142
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,080
So when it came to agents,

1143
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,120
I mean we were inspired by SOA, right?

1144
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,290
Think about what it taught us

1145
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,940
to break up the monolith, right?

1146
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,377
We took these big systems

1147
00:47:22,377 --> 00:47:26,070
and we turned them into smaller
pieces with a clear purpose.

1148
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,001
That same discipline applies to agents,

1149
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,150
and we built specialized agents

1150
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,540
and gave them one job that
they have to do really well.

1151
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,600
And that keeps the focus really clean

1152
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,860
and the reasoning sharp,

1153
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,650
and then the handoffs between
agents is even cleaner.

1154
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,050
But instead of having
one giant orchestrator

1155
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,440
pulling all the strings, ours
acts more like a conductor,

1156
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,020
it sits in the middle,
it can interpret intent,

1157
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,120
and then it could figure
out what's happening,

1158
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,230
where is it happening,

1159
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:55,200
and then it connects that
problem to the right expert

1160
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,793
or the right team of experts.

1161
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,390
But even experts need boundaries.

1162
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,270
With all this autonomy, we
needed to have guardrails.

1163
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,170
We needed some way

1164
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,900
that we could enforce
policy and compliance,

1165
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,990
so we applied guardrails at
the edge with the orchestrator,

1166
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,020
and this gives us defense
in depth for every decision

1167
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,850
that happens in the platform.

1168
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,060
Now, we're sanitizing
text, we're blocking topics

1169
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,690
and redacting PII, both on
the way in and on the way out.

1170
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,260
So now the guardrails, they're
not just protecting our data,

1171
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,230
they're actually protecting
the agents from themselves

1172
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,610
so they can wander, right?

1173
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,013
But they still can't color
outside of the lines.

1174
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,090
But none of this works

1175
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,420
unless they're all operating
on this same source of truth.

1176
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,610
And that's where shared
knowledge comes in.

1177
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,790
Now, all of our agents tap
into the same knowledge base.

1178
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,250
So that means when we have a Q and A agent

1179
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,500
answering a question about connectivity,

1180
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,260
it's pulling from the same
material an ops agent would

1181
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,000
if it were troubleshooting.

1182
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,530
They're separate services,

1183
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,930
but it's consistent understanding.

1184
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,290
It's like giving every
application in your service layer,

1185
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,970
this unified data plane,

1186
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,580
only now it's made up of runbooks

1187
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,553
and reference architectures
and living documentation.

1188
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,870
But thinking isn't enough, right?

1189
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,080
At some point, we gotta let
the agents do something,

1190
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,870
but they act just like any
other service on the network.

1191
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,330
They're calling APIs and CP servers.

1192
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,100
They're executing the
tools we've given them

1193
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,720
to do their jobs.

1194
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,630
So with Bedrock action groups,
we can run these Lambdas

1195
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,080
inside of our VPCs with
tightly scoped permissions,

1196
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,720
and then we can control
what they can reach

1197
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,100
and what they can't reach.

1198
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,120
And at the end of the day,

1199
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,070
it's just services talking to services

1200
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,863
just like any other application
layer on the network.

1201
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,093
So how do we define that truth?

1202
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,700
Documentation, of course.

1203
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,700
And ironically, that was the
hardest part of all this,

1204
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,030
because at the enterprise,
you know it can live anywhere.

1205
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,860
And even when people can find it,

1206
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,210
they don't like to read it,

1207
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,310
but they'll chat with it, that's for sure.

1208
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,470
So we wanted to build something

1209
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,630
that could grow and evolve
with the organization,

1210
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,450
and we needed something more
than just a a dumping ground

1211
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,190
for files in S3.

1212
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,040
So we chose Kendra, with the Gen AI index

1213
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,840
because it gives us this hybrid.

1214
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,280
We get keyword and vector search
with multimodal embeddings,

1215
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,110
and with all of the built-in connectors

1216
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,530
for things like Confluence
and GitHub and Google Drive,

1217
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,420
we're able to keep all of our information

1218
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,390
in sync automatically
with Chron schedules.

1219
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,390
Now it includes source code and diagrams

1220
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,950
and policies and runbooks.

1221
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,200
It's like all of our domain expertise

1222
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,783
finally lives in this
one searchable layer.

1223
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:41,250
And the best part about that
is it actually comes to us.

1224
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,320
We don't have to chase it down anymore.

1225
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,170
We don't have to find the documentation.

1226
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,110
The real breakthrough wasn't
just building a knowledge base,

1227
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,860
it was figuring out how are
we gonna manage this thing?

1228
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,190
It's those data sources
for Terraform, for Kendra,

1229
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,780
they're configured in Terraform

1230
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,900
and they live in GitHub, and
we deploy them with CICD.

1231
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,390
So with self-service, we allow the people

1232
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,420
who own that content, the
subject matter experts,

1233
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,130
to maintain it themselves.

1234
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,450
They can open a pull request

1235
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,510
and we can deploy their changes
through GitHub's pipelines.

1236
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,850
Now, it's still enterprise knowledge,

1237
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,200
we're just treating it
like infrastructure now.

1238
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,070
I'm not gonna lie,

1239
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,900
observability was a bit of a puzzle.

1240
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,660
Like we have this third party
chat up on the front end,

1241
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,320
this hybrid identity between
Google and Active Directory.

1242
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,140
And we had Lambdas and
Step Functions and Bedrock.

1243
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,930
It started to feel like we
had metrics coming at us

1244
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,490
from every direction.

1245
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,200
So we had to find a way
to stitch it all together

1246
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,400
so we could actually
see what was happening.

1247
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,530
So we built this
persistence layer in Dynamo,

1248
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,910
and this is where we store the things

1249
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,590
we care about long term.

1250
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,650
This is all of our users, their
chat spaces, their sessions,

1251
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:50,940
all of their messages.

1252
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,850
But it's not a transcript.
This is relationships.

1253
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,830
Because every item here keys back

1254
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,783
to a session and a trace ID.

1255
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,030
And those traces land in S3,
and this became our black box.

1256
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,470
This is like the flight recorder

1257
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,090
that captures every decision

1258
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,890
that's made across the platform.

1259
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,110
I mean, it's basically
distributed tracing, right?

1260
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,420
But instead of following a request,

1261
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,253
we're following a train of thought.

1262
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,030
And of course we needed transparency.

1263
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,450
So we pushed all of our logs
into Splunk through Kinesis,

1264
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,630
and now even info security and compliance

1265
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,920
and risk and legal,

1266
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,570
they've all got a real time view

1267
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,400
of what's happening in the platform.

1268
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,960
They can see what people are saying,

1269
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,790
they can see what the agents are saying.

1270
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,500
They can see all of the redactions,

1271
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,330
all of the policies being enforced.

1272
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,943
And at the end of the
day, everyone's happy.

1273
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:42,990
Now, I'm gonna say this
like it was 10 years ago,

1274
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,130
because it feels like it,

1275
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,560
but it was only four or five weeks.

1276
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,920
But back when we started,
there was no AgentCore.

1277
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,200
There was no built-in observability,

1278
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,680
but we still needed a way to
understand what was happening.

1279
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,960
So we got together and
we built this dashboard

1280
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,420
that produces some practical insights.

1281
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,270
And of course when I say
we, I mean me and my team

1282
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:05,850
and Cursor and Claude and Copilot,

1283
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,370
but all my smartest friends helped out.

1284
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,750
But literally with this dashboard,

1285
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,510
we can replay a conversation step by step,

1286
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,270
and then we can see the
story sort of unfold.

1287
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,220
We can see what people are asking for.

1288
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,470
We can see where the
agents are struggling,

1289
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,760
and we can see where maybe

1290
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,590
our knowledge base needs some work.

1291
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,790
But this kind of visibility

1292
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,700
doesn't just measure
quality, it shapes it.

1293
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,590
This is what drives our roadmap.

1294
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,773
This is what tells us what
we need to build next.

1295
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,400
I'm almost done, I promise.

1296
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,860
It's my last one, then everybody can go.

1297
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,780
This was a big year for AI.

1298
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,510
All the new models, all the
new services, the tools,

1299
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,400
all the new acronyms that we're secretly

1300
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,420
Googling on the side,

1301
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,210
and I hope I'm not the only
one who has to do that.

1302
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,850
But honestly, I've never
had more fun learning

1303
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,110
and building at the same time.

1304
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,940
And I feel really lucky that I get to work

1305
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,920
with this stuff because it's awesome.

1306
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,330
It just is.

1307
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,350
I learned a lot this year,

1308
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,780
but there's three lessons I'm
gonna carry into next year

1309
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,970
that I want to share with you.

1310
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,700
Number one, the architecture
still matters, right?

1311
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,440
It's all the same diagrams.

1312
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,440
There's new services
and there's new icons,

1313
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,210
but you don't need to be a data scientist

1314
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,470
to piece it all together.

1315
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,843
I feel like I'm living proof of that.

1316
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,770
And second, you don't
have to build a platform.

1317
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,470
You can start small, but think big.

1318
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,750
Build something simple that will teach you

1319
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,953
what to build next.

1320
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,360
And of course, please breathe right?

1321
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,460
Go outside, touch some grass.

1322
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,660
Maybe wait till you get home.

1323
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,340
There's not a lot of grass in Vegas,

1324
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,560
but seriously, it's way too easy

1325
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,660
to get wrapped up in all this tech, right?

1326
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,270
We still have a say in this,
don't let it overtake you

1327
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,160
because you could blink,

1328
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,860
and the next thing you know,
you're in Vegas on the stage

1329
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,840
and you're explaining
what you did last year,

1330
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,590
'cause that could happen, trust me.

1331
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,613
Thank you.

1332
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:53,962
This was awesome.

1333
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:54,810
(audience applauding)

1334
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,330
- Thanks, Dan. Thank you everybody.

1335
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,620
Hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.

1336
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,150
Remember, if this is your first one,

1337
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,230
we've got surveys that come out.

1338
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,030
Really helps us and gives us the ability

1339
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,863
to speak in the future,

1340
00:55:03,863 --> 00:55:05,760
especially if you enjoy the session here.

1341
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,920
So have fun this week.

1342
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,260
Stay safe, enjoy the party on Thursday,

1343
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,553
and thanks again.
