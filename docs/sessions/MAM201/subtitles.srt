1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,470
- All right, to get started,

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,073
who hates raising their hands in sessions?

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,223
All right, cool.

4
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:08,520
Now that we got that outta the way.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,003
How many of you have moved at
least five times in your life?

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,700
All right. How many have
moved 10 times in your life?

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,320
Whoa. All right, so get a load of this.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,280
This is the one thing you're gonna,

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,517
like next week you're gonna be like,

10
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:23,370
"Man, the one thing I
remember from re:Invent,

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,203
it's this right here."

12
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:25,320
Ready? All right.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,590
The average person between age 18 and 45

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,160
in the United States has moved 11 times.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,600
I kid you not, you're gonna
wake up a week from now

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,460
and you're gonna be like,
"This bald bearded guy told me

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,830
that people moved 11 times in their life."

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,923
Why do people stop moving
so much after age 45?

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,380
- [Attendee] Lifestyle changes.

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,570
- Yeah, it's painful.
Your lifestyle changes.

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,591
You don't have time for this.
Moving can be a real pain.

22
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,110
- [Attendee] Well, there's one more move.

23
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,093
- One more. Yeah, one more move for sure.

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,800
So when we started our
planning for this session,

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,887
Aarthi and I were like, you know,

26
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,470
"We really like these sessions to be fun."

27
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,640
We'd like to figure out some way

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,260
to actually make this engaging.

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,093
So what do we do?

30
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:06,690
We reach out to our
product marketing person.

31
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,730
I wanted to share with
you some behind the scenes

32
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,290
of how this actually works.

33
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,500
So Aarthi emails Bianca,
our amazing teammate

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,487
who works in product
marketing, and she's like,

35
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:18,277
"Hey, can we get a moving
truck up next to the stage?

36
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:21,780
You know, we brought the
trucks in the past on stage.

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,280
Could we do that?" Bianca's
response was like, "For real?"

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,530
And we're like, "Yeah, don't
worry, we won't drive it.

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,170
It'll just sit there. Maybe
we can get some moving boxes."

40
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,590
And she was not reassured on this.

41
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,140
All right, so, well, we
couldn't get moving trucks,

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,780
we couldn't get boxes.

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,903
What do we do? Next
best thing, we used AI.

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,750
About 10 prompts later,

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,840
I was able to successfully
generate an image

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,190
that I thought was great.

47
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,710
A huge thank you to my wife for telling me

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,330
what a boho aesthetic is.

49
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,070
I would not have known that.

50
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,840
And my children for saying
that this "High key slays."

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,900
So I think we have a
pretty good image here.

52
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,340
So the question you're all asking is,

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,480
why in the world am I looking

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,823
at an AI generated image of a couch?

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,080
The thing I wanna point out
here is when you're moving,

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,180
the way that we move this couch

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,090
versus the way that we move
the books in the background

58
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,300
versus the way we move
the lamps or the plants,

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,350
they're all different.

60
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,650
It's not one-size-fits-all
for how we move all of it.

61
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,940
The new house you're moving into

62
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,850
may not have amazing AI
generated bookshelves

63
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,030
in the background to put
those AI generated books on.

64
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,890
They may have a different layout,

65
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,350
the house may have
different number of rooms,

66
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,940
but it's all different when you're moving

67
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,060
from point A to point B having
to try to figure that out.

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,640
Typically it's pretty easy
to actually move the couch.

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,310
I say that, you know, not
having moved a couch recently,

70
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,840
but it is pretty easy to move that,

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,460
you know, it's a big fixed item.

72
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,990
You can just lift it and you can shift it

73
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,250
into the new location.

74
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,810
Whereas the books, a
lot of the knickknacks

75
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,820
or smaller items, figuring
out where all of those go

76
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,720
in the new house, that part
can take a little bit of time.

77
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,200
So as we talk about
moving, it's the same thing

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,310
that really happens when we're talking

79
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,770
about moving our applications
and moving our workloads

80
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,650
from an on-prem
environment into the cloud.

81
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,150
And one thing that we really think about

82
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,070
is that there is not a single path.

83
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,410
There is no single way to move everything

84
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,190
from on prem into the cloud
that makes sense for everybody.

85
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,040
All of you may be at a
completely different place

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,150
in your cloud journey.

87
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,580
You may have completely
different types of workloads

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,500
that need to move in
completely different ways.

89
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes, picking up a VM, moving
it from point A to point B,

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,710
that part can work pretty well,
it's pretty straightforward.

91
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,210
But you may have other applications

92
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,300
that are better suited to run
on spot instances within EC2

93
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,880
or even different size
or different capabilities

94
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,710
within those EC2 instances.

95
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,190
You may have cases where you could move

96
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,630
into a serverless architecture,

97
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,000
you could leverage Lambda,
you could leverage EKS,

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,360
you could use RDS and move
it into managed services.

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,540
The thing here is that
we talk about customers

100
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,120
not being a one-size-fits-all,
like there is no,

101
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,400
we say "This customer's
going to lift and shift."

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
That's really not the case.

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,010
This customer maybe use lift and shift

104
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,570
for certain applications,

105
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,870
or they may be using different
methods as they go along.

106
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,100
When we talk about these methods,

107
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,770
if any of you have ever
seen the AWS articles

108
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,800
about the seven Rs, there's,
you know, the different methods

109
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,210
for actually relocating.

110
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,460
A lot of the methods I showed
here fit into the seven Rs.

111
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,953
You can re-platform, you can refactor,

112
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:24,420
you can rehost, you can relocate.

113
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,380
There's a lot of different ways

114
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,450
that you can go about
moving these applications

115
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,980
from point A to point B.

116
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,680
And even the point B may
be different in many cases,

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
point B may still be on premises.

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,490
You may be able to use those workloads

119
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,610
or run those workloads within
something like an AWS Outpost,

120
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,210
which can still run in your
on-premises environment.

121
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,960
So let's talk about one way to do that

122
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,070
and that's lifting and shifting

123
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,410
from an on-premises VMware environment

124
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,750
into a cloud-based VMware environment.

125
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,860
So earlier this year,

126
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,040
we launched the Amazon
Elastic VMware Service.

127
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,500
The Elastic VMware Service is the ability

128
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,500
to take and run VMware-based
workloads, the VCF stack

129
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,580
directly in your Amazon, your AWS VPC.

130
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,920
So just like how you
would run an EC2 instance

131
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
within your BPC and connect
it to the environment,

132
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,510
you can now run VMware stack

133
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,490
directly on AWS metal infrastructure

134
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,830
sitting within that environment.

135
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,540
So this is the same VMware stack

136
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,610
that you would run in your
on-premises environment.

137
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,120
It's not something special,
it's not some modified version.

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
We literally take the commercial
off-the-shelf capabilities,

139
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,310
the commercial off-the-shelf software

140
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,940
and we run that within AWS
VPCs within the environment

141
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,160
so that you're able to move
from point A to point B

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,920
without having to change the
people skills that you have,

143
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,100
the processes and
runbooks that they operate

144
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,450
and the technology that they use,

145
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,603
whether that be third-party
solutions or scripts.

146
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,340
So from a basic feature perspective,

147
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,130
I mentioned that this is
running the standard BCF stack.

148
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,400
So we take Cloud Builder, which
is a part of the BCF stack,

149
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,560
we gather a bunch of
information from you upfront.

150
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,300
We say, "Hey, tell me
about the underlay networks

151
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,290
that you wanna run.

152
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,490
Tell me about the number of hosts

153
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,720
that you want in the environment."

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
We collect a bunch of
information from you upfront

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,410
through the AWS Console.

156
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,490
We take that information

157
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,860
and we actually bootstrap
the metal instances

158
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,260
and we push the configuration
into Cloud Builder

159
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,500
and then let Cloud Builder
deploy the VMware stack.

160
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,380
So in VCF, it's basically
just like how you would take

161
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,450
those old-school CDs that used to have

162
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,690
the pre-configured
configuration for VMware

163
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,940
and you pop it in and the
server kind of brings itself up.

164
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,010
It's very similar to
that in the cloud world,

165
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,080
where you give us a bunch of
information ahead of time,

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,790
we'll take that, we'll
bootstrap the environment,

167
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,680
we'll pass the information
to Cloud Builder.

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,300
It'll run and configure the environment,

169
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,680
we hand you back the credentials

170
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,910
and we say, "Here's the credentials."

171
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,430
Now you can log in and
you're running VMware

172
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,893
on EC2 instances within your BPC.

173
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,200
You can interface with this

174
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,870
through both the AWS Console and the API.

175
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,700
So if you were to go into your AWS Console

176
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,640
and look for the EVS, you would
actually find that service

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,860
and you could go in and
deploy an environment

178
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,960
and get started today.

179
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,510
I did mention we're
running on EC2 instances.

180
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,220
These are i4i.metal instances,

181
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,920
so this is bare metal, this
is not nested virtualization

182
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,350
or any kind of, you know, vert
on vert or special hardware

183
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,360
sitting off in the corner
of our data centers.

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,970
This is standard EC2 metal infrastructure

185
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,980
with the i4i.metal instances.

186
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,440
Today we do run VCF 5.2.1

187
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,080
and you do have access
to SCDC manager, vCenter,

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,110
all the normal VMware tools
that you would run on prem,

189
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,300
you can access those in EVS.

190
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,790
So a really simple way
of thinking about this

191
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,460
is it's almost like using
AWS metal infrastructure,

192
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,200
like a co-location environment,

193
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,340
but you're able to dynamically

194
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,800
scale up and down those servers
with the click of a button

195
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,663
as opposed to ordering more hardware.

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
You do have full administrative rights

197
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,270
so we do not run this
as a managed service.

198
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,490
This is completely controlled
by you, the customer.

199
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,323
Just like if you were doing it

200
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:50,130
in an on-premises environment.

201
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,630
You have full admin access.

202
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,480
You can get and do really
just about anything

203
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,740
in this environment that you could do

204
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,240
in an on-premises environment.

205
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,360
From a consumption perspective,
you do have the ability

206
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,090
to deploy instances using
instant savings plans.

207
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,670
So if you wanted to commit
at a one year interval

208
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,190
or consume on demand or
even three year intervals,

209
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,770
you do have flexibility and choice

210
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,310
as far as how you consume those instances.

211
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,250
And we do operate in a
bring-your-own subscription model.

212
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,160
Going forward, kind of
in all cloud providers

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,480
running VMware, it is a
bring-your-own subscription model.

214
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,610
So you can take the
existing VCF subscriptions

215
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,830
that you have on premises,
you can bring those with you

216
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,270
and you can apply those and use those

217
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,300
into the EVS environment.

218
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,430
And then choice, you do have the ability

219
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,340
to run these yourself or
you can engage a partner.

220
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,510
We worked with a lot of partners

221
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,150
who have built managed
services where they can come in

222
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,220
and operate this for you in AWS

223
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,870
just like you would do in
an on-premises environment.

224
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,720
From a scale perspective, we
launched EVS back in August

225
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
and we had six regions available.

226
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,230
We're now up to 12 regions

227
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,350
and we're continuing to launch
more regions later this year

228
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,670
as well as going into next year.

229
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,130
So you'll continue to see us
work in getting EVS launched

230
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,133
into all AWS regions
over the next few months.

231
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,000
I mentioned briefly kind
of the customer managed

232
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,080
versus partner managed.

233
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,030
This is a big deal for a lot of customers

234
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,690
who are maybe moving to
the cloud and they have had

235
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,030
on-premises managed
service provider partners

236
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,220
that they were using
who are no longer a part

237
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,100
of Broadcom's managed
service provider program.

238
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,710
In that case, you are
able to move into EVS

239
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,940
and leverage third-party partners

240
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,790
who are still in that program.

241
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,050
They have a lot of expertise

242
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,500
with running in EC2 environments
running inside of AWS,

243
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
and they have a lot of expertise

244
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,750
running in VMware environments.

245
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,890
And so there's just a lot of partners

246
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,880
that you can leverage to do that

247
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,100
or you have the choice to do it yourself.

248
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
The big thing here is there's
a lot of offerings out there

249
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,480
that force you into a managed model.

250
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,550
They force to say, "Hey, you don't have

251
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,600
full administrative access.

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,550
You're operating in a delegated model."

253
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,430
In our case, we have built this

254
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,500
as a customer-managed solution first.

255
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,600
So by default you have
access to everything

256
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
and then you can bring in a partner

257
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,290
if you would like them to run
and operate the environment

258
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,123
on your behalf.

259
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,620
Quickly just mentioning
some of those partners,

260
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,750
it's not just the managed
service provider partners

261
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,910
like that we have here shown at the top,

262
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,220
but also on the ISV side.

263
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,780
A lot of the tools that you use

264
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,220
in your on-premises data centers

265
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,670
will operate just the same way in EVS.

266
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,270
Think of things like NetApp
or Pure Storage or Veeam.

267
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,077
A common thing we used to
hear from customers is,

268
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:27,840
"Hey, when I moved to the cloud,

269
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,090
it's not just about moving the workloads.

270
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,770
I have to now suddenly reevaluate

271
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,270
all these solutions that I'm using.

272
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,730
My backup provider, my DR provider,

273
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,280
I have my security tools,
like all these things

274
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,650
that I've built and integrated
into my environment.

275
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,790
I now have to reevaluate

276
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,890
how I'm going to do those in the cloud."

277
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,770
When you lift and shift with
EVS, pick up those workloads,

278
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,800
move them from VMware to
VMware, you can keep the people,

279
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,350
the processes and the
technology exactly the same

280
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,490
as what you had on premises

281
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,890
because you're still using
a VMware environment.

282
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,630
So kind of going back
to that moving metaphor

283
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,370
that we talked about in the beginning.

284
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,440
Imagine you have a house,

285
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,720
and your house is kind of out
in the country a little bit

286
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
and you have a whole bunch of land.

287
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,990
So you have a whole
bunch of space available

288
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,850
to where if you wanted to
build things, you could.

289
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,360
You could build a bakery,
you could build a store,

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,950
you could build whatever you wanted.

291
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,720
You have tons of space, but ultimately,

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,820
you have to build it yourself.

293
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,010
Now think about moving into a destination

294
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,990
where you're a part of a vibrant village,

295
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,020
a community that has all of
these things already in there.

296
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,630
You already have a baker,
you already have a grocer,

297
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,160
there is a hardware shop.

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,990
All of these things exist in this village

299
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,160
and now it's walkable.

300
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,740
You can just walk over and
interface with these things

301
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,960
without having to go
and build it yourself.

302
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,240
That's really the way
you think about scaling

303
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,540
and operating in a VMware
environment in AWS.

304
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,030
You're taking the same
house, the same floor plan,

305
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,320
everything that you had before

306
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,900
and you're able to move
that into a community

307
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,360
that now has all of
these other capabilities.

308
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,870
So you can take this workload
that you are running in VMware

309
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,060
and now it's sitting in your VPC,

310
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,370
you have RDS that you're
running in your VPC,

311
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,740
you have S3, you have EFS,

312
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,690
you have all these
other cloud capabilities

313
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,960
that are now sitting co-resident
in the same environment

314
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,970
with your VMware-based workloads.

315
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,710
And we see a lot of customers do this.

316
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,810
They'll take a database for example

317
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,630
that's running inside of VMware

318
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,520
and they may move that over to RDS,

319
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,700
but the application
itself is still running

320
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,900
in VMware on a VM.

321
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,510
If the application is really,
really hard to transform

322
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,630
or modernize or change,
we are totally fine

323
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,990
with being able to have you
run that workload in VMware.

324
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,370
In fact, if you have workloads

325
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,140
that you plan on keeping in VMware,

326
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,760
we want to be the best place in the world

327
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,950
for you to run those
VMware-based workloads.

328
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,660
If, when you move that into the cloud,

329
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,210
you want to expand and
extend that application

330
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,490
to be able to interface
with other AWS workloads,

331
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,690
we want you to have
that capability as well.

332
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,740
All right, I'm gonna
hand it over to Aarthi

333
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,730
and she's gonna talk a little bit

334
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,380
about the building blocks of EVS.

335
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,183
- Thank you Andy.

336
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,120
While our product marketing person

337
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,760
was not able to get us
the couch or the truck,

338
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,157
we got a good Monday session
that I requested for.

339
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:06,360
And the primary reason

340
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,610
is what I'll be doing the next few minutes

341
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,610
is talking about the
three key building blocks

342
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,140
that make up the service.

343
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,150
This is an introductory-level session

344
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,210
and then we have some great
deeper dives throughout the week

345
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,920
that you can go in and plug into

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,200
as you wanna learn more about the storage

347
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,733
or networking, et cetera.

348
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,280
Andy touched upon this,

349
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,800
I wanna spend a couple of minutes here.

350
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,850
When EVS deploys the VCF stack,

351
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,940
we get inputs from you,
and if you've deployed

352
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,930
a Cloud Builder on VCF stack
on premises, you would see

353
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,150
that the Cloud Builder
requires certain inputs

354
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,560
and that's all the service is doing.

355
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,840
We collect all these inputs from you

356
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,000
and take care of the deployment.

357
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,070
It is a fully self-managed service

358
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,840
minus the initial deployment.

359
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,800
We wanted to kind of remove
that deployment from you

360
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,470
and take care of it on behalf of you.

361
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,270
So when the stack is deployed,

362
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,527
you get all these components
deployed, from SDDC manager

363
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:07,440
to the ESXI hypervisor,
to storage, to networking.

364
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,700
But we also take care,

365
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,760
and as you'll see when we talk
about the building blocks,

366
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,700
the underlying connectivity
and storage options for you,

367
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,750
depending on your use case
and your application needs.

368
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,850
When we deploy the stack,

369
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,520
we deploy it in a single
consolidated domain.

370
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,470
But of course there's flexibility for you

371
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,690
as you deploy more hosts

372
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,730
and you can bring up additional clusters,

373
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,163
you can do multiple workload domains.

374
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,927
We deploy, I kept saying we deploy,

375
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,570
EVS service deploys
the environment for you

376
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,410
in your AWS account in
a VPC that you choose.

377
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,750
So obviously from a security standpoint,

378
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,890
the AWS shared responsibility
model is still applicable.

379
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,790
Where it varies is we as
an AWS are responsible

380
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,940
for the underlying AWS
components that you see here.

381
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,030
So this means from a region
availability standpoint

382
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,150
or an availability zone
standpoint, we take care of that.

383
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,040
We also take care of capacity for you.

384
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,100
So you place in a capacity
request reservation

385
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,390
saying, "Hey, I need 10
hosts by a specific date."

386
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,020
And we enable that
capacity into your account.

387
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,540
But anything upward of the hyper wise

388
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,990
of the ESXI stack upwards
is your responsibility.

389
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,430
This means you are responsible

390
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,320
for patching your environment,

391
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,963
you're responsible for updates, et cetera.

392
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,450
There's three key building
blocks that I kept mentioning.

393
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,703
The first one obviously is compute.

394
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,040
We started with i4i.metal
as our first instance type.

395
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
This is a bare metal instance

396
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,270
where we deploy the environment on.

397
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,510
We have a good history with i4i.metal.

398
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,920
For some of you who are familiar

399
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,430
with the VMware cloud on
AWS, the managed service,

400
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,350
we utilized i4i.metal.

401
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,990
We've received good
feedback from customers

402
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,143
across various use cases
of their applications.

403
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,490
These instances also go
through a full certification

404
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,323
with Broadcom.

405
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:09,690
So today, if you go into the
Broadcom Compatibility Guide,

406
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,640
you will see Amazon i4i.metal
listed as a certified instance

407
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,980
to run VCF 5.2.1.

408
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,860
So we do go through the
entire service certification,

409
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,773
storage and network
certification with Broadcom.

410
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,730
We launched with one instance type

411
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,820
and our goal is eventually
to get every metal instance

412
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,390
that's available on the AWS
portfolio available for you

413
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,627
so you can choose based on,

414
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,500
"Hey, I do have a high-memory workload

415
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,990
so I need more memory versus compute."

416
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,273
So that's our goal and
it's on our roadmap.

417
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,050
Andy talked about scaling.

418
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,570
So if you think about how do
you scale this environment

419
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,740
that we deploy, think of the
EVS stack that we deploy,

420
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,350
the environment as a top level construct.

421
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,370
Within the environment,

422
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,340
we take care of that first
cluster that you see here.

423
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,053
It's a four host minimum.

424
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,940
This comes from the VCF
requirement that we have

425
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,090
and every environment
can have up to 16 hosts.

426
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,040
We've tested up to 16 hosts

427
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,900
and are satisfied with the performance

428
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,280
and we are slowly expanding

429
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,710
this number of hosts soon as well.

430
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,330
You could have up to 16 hosts

431
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,150
and you could have this as
multiple clusters as well

432
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,800
within that environment.

433
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,460
If you have a requirement to
scale beyond 16 hosts today,

434
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,070
you could obviously create
multiple environments

435
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,280
and these environments can
communicate to each other

436
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,023
using a transit gateway.

437
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,033
The next building block is storage.

438
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,370
The i4i.metal instances
come with 30 tebibytes

439
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,790
of local NVME storage,
which is what we use

440
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,943
for the primary storage,
which is vSAN in this case.

441
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,930
We are using the ESA, the
express storage architecture,

442
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,490
which gives a better performance

443
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,130
compared to the OSA architecture.

444
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,000
So vSAN forms the primary
storage that is available.

445
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,850
What we've also had
feedback from customers

446
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,160
is, "Hey, I wanna make
sure this is consistent

447
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,470
with my on-premises experience."

448
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,940
And so if you're doing

449
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,790
storage policy-based
management on premises,

450
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,640
you want to control what
your rate levels are

451
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,890
or what your failure to tolerance is,

452
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,660
all that's still possible.

453
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,150
You could log to your vCenter console

454
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,760
once the environment is deployed for you

455
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,780
and you can configure these
as you would do on premises.

456
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,870
One of the feedback we've received

457
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,730
when we started running private preview

458
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,590
and then we moved into a public preview

459
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,020
is scalability on storage.

460
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,600
Not a lot of workloads need that compute,

461
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,763
but are more storage intensive.

462
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,900
So we've partnered with
our internal service,

463
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,750
the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

464
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,060
as an additional storage option.

465
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,160
The primary storage is still vSAN,

466
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,170
but you could create
additional data stores

467
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,240
using NetApp ONTAP.

468
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,840
Or Andy talked, you have
full administrative access

469
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,670
to this EVS environment,

470
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,330
which means if you are using
ISV solutions on premises

471
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,860
like Veeam or Pure Cloud
Storage for example,

472
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,080
you have the ability to integrate

473
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,150
with these storage vendors as well

474
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,300
depending on your application needs.

475
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,030
So if you take a look at how this fits

476
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,480
with FSx for NetApp ONTAP,

477
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,570
the primary storage is
still our vSAN datastore.

478
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,060
You could create an additional file system

479
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,550
and mount it to your ESXI host

480
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,310
and that could be either
using NFS or iSCSI

481
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,170
depending on the protocol

482
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,050
and it becomes your additional storage.

483
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,770
So for customers who do
not want to just increase

484
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,130
the number of hosts primarily
because of storage reasons,

485
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,560
you could have your
minimum number of hosts

486
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,320
and then work with either ISV vendors

487
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,803
or FSx for NetApp ONTAP
to increase the storage.

488
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,830
How does this look like?

489
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,050
So if you take a look
at this diagram here,

490
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,413
customer VPC is your VPC.

491
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:11,413
The EVS environment gets
deployed inside this VPC.

492
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,190
You can go ahead into your AWS account,

493
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,533
create a file share in
FSx for NetApp ONTAP,

494
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,690
and as long as you enable

495
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,910
the right security group permissions,

496
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,860
you have access to these file systems.

497
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,610
So this is using NFS, the
same architecture is available

498
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,720
for iSCSI as well.

499
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,100
You create the (indistinct)

500
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,050
and then have security group permissions

501
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,933
so that you can have
traffic going both ways.

502
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,940
The third building block is networking.

503
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,650
We've done a lot of work here.

504
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,360
I mentioned in the beginning,

505
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,330
when we deploy the
environment, we deploy it,

506
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,790
we take care of storage and networking.

507
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,230
What it also means is
traditionally, AWS has always been

508
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,670
a flat layer three network.

509
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,720
We have a VPC, you deploy a
cinder block, you have subnets.

510
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,250
Work great.

511
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,520
As we started to build
EVS, we also wanted to see

512
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,990
how do we bring this VLAN
subnet concept into VPC.

513
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,970
So we've taken care of that.

514
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,370
What we've done is, Andy
mentioned when he started,

515
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,720
there's overlay networks,

516
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,150
there's underlay networks, et cetera.

517
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,040
So as part of the deployment

518
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,080
we take care of that networking for you

519
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,430
so you don't have to worry.

520
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,650
All you have to provide us is inputs

521
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,773
on what your appliance IP
address spacing should be.

522
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,970
And a key part of that

523
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,970
is also using some of
the existing AWS features

524
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,320
that are available.

525
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,020
As you think about your EVS environment,

526
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,330
you probably are going
to connect on premises

527
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,360
to talk to a VMware
environment that's there

528
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,840
or you want to maintain
a hybrid environment.

529
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,230
So we've used the existing AWS
route server functionality,

530
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,740
think of it as a BGP
propagation mechanism.

531
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,110
What it does is you've got a lot of IPs,

532
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,450
underlay IPs, overlay IPs, et cetera.

533
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,250
This is like your VM IP
spaces or your appliance IPs,

534
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,240
so the route server basically
enables BGP communication.

535
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,090
It acts as a BGP endpoint
between your NSX Edge

536
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,910
and all your route tables,
propagates your route table

537
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,460
so you don't have to worry
about any of those failovers,

538
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,640
or like IP addressing going
in and adding static routes

539
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,843
into your route table.

540
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,260
And if you take a step back

541
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,780
of the full external connectivity,

542
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,700
you can have multiple EVS environments

543
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,510
as part of inner region.

544
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,980
You can also have other workloads

545
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,770
that you're running within
the same VPC as well.

546
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,450
And then I mentioned, all this connects

547
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,790
into a transit gateway.

548
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,230
And then from the transit gateway,

549
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,210
you could either have a direct connect

550
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,260
or a VPN connection back to
your on-premises network.

551
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,263
So it enables the full
end-to-end connectivity.

552
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,700
I'll quickly touch upon pricing.

553
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,000
So we talked about, Andy
mentioned we are operating

554
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,680
in a bring-your-own license

555
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,720
or bring-your-own subscription model.

556
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,060
So what do you pay for AWS?

557
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,910
The first one is the actual instance cost.

558
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,460
So this is the EC2 instance
that you're running today.

559
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,590
It's a four host minimum.

560
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,130
All your existing savings plan
and reserved instance concept

561
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,093
still applies to this.

562
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:20,190
This is a standard EC2 instance.

563
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,880
We're not doing anything
out of the ordinary here.

564
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,940
The second is that VPC
route server endpoints.

565
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,670
You do require two VPC
route server endpoints

566
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,870
per environment.

567
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,440
So you do have a cost that's
associated to take care of it.

568
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,310
And finally is the service
control plane fee itself.

569
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,390
This is where the service itself

570
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,650
takes care of the deployment,

571
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,800
the underlying connectivity
between your appliances

572
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,470
to RVPC space, et cetera.

573
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,460
So there is a hourly fee
built for this environment.

574
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,150
So these are three dimensions
that you will incur

575
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,420
as part of an EVS pricing model.

576
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,090
With that, I will pause.

577
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,100
It's always good to hear from customers.

578
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,160
So we've been working with
Jignesh from NYU Langone

579
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,050
for the last several months now.

580
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,023
I'd love to invite Jignesh to
share their journey with you.

581
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,790
- Thank you Aarthi. Hello everyone.

582
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,150
I'm Jignesh Shah, manager
of cloud engineering

583
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,863
over at NYU Langone Health.

584
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,040
I'd like to start off with a number. 320.

585
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,130
That's the average number of days it takes

586
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,673
for an enterprise application
to migrate to the cloud.

587
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,350
I'll be talking about how NYU

588
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,213
was able to bring that number down.

589
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,553
Little bit about who we are.

590
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,840
A large academic healthcare system

591
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,880
based out of New York City.

592
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,363
Our mission is to provide
world-class patient care,

593
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,590
in a way to research, and
a top-notch medical school.

594
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,420
And yes, the medical school is free

595
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,820
if you can manage to get in.

596
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,610
The three pillars.

597
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,590
Patient care, research,
and the the medical school,

598
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,660
you know, that's really powered

599
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,310
by the world-class technology
that we provide to support it

600
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,283
with the help of partners like AWS.

601
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,743
Some key facts and statistics.

602
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,910
We've been number one for quite some time

603
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,343
for the best outcomes.

604
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,713
Constantly ranked on the top
for several subspecialties.

605
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,450
Whether it's neurosurgery,
orthopedic, pediatric,

606
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,803
we are up there.

607
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,180
We have about five large
campus in the five boroughs,

608
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,340
along with close to
400 outpatient centers.

609
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,340
We see about 2 million
outpatient visits every day.

610
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,623
And in terms of number of employees,

611
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,510
we are close to about
53,000 in total employees.

612
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,433
So quite large academia.

613
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,127
Okay, so our adoption of EVS.

614
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,500
I remember it was few months ago,

615
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,400
you know, I was watching Monday
Night Football with my son,

616
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,070
I think it was Giants versus Eagles.

617
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,170
And I get a phone call from my boss

618
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,170
and he says, "we have to
go down from taking months

619
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,500
to weeks to migrate our applications."

620
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,820
So the first thought, you
know, I wanted to tell my boss

621
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,697
that "You're crazy, it's impossible."

622
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,010
And in turn, next morning we huddled,

623
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,690
I called my team.

624
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,610
And you know, we have
smart cloud architects,

625
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,063
security analysts, SRE engineers,

626
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,040
and I challenged them to find a solution

627
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,953
to accelerate our journey to the cloud.

628
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,970
And being a VMware shop on prem,
it was a natural transition

629
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,150
to go to something VMC in
one of the hyperscalers.

630
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,270
So we started contacting
different hyperscalers,

631
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,140
we came up with a
comprehensive success criteria

632
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,410
and it was really
detailed success criteria.

633
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,290
All the way from security
to chaos engineering,

634
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,643
we had everything in it.

635
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,700
Few months later, we had
a breakthrough with EVS

636
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,260
and I'll go through some of
the reasons why we chose EVS,

637
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,470
what resonated the most with us.

638
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,513
But first, our business case,

639
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,730
it was accelerate migration to the cloud.

640
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,780
How can we go from
months to just few weeks?

641
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,780
And also, can we leverage
cloud for business continuity?

642
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,633
As you can imagine, being
a healthcare system,

643
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,930
our uptime is absolutely crucial.

644
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,310
So business continuity

645
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,243
was one of the biggest use case.

646
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,933
Some of the business requirements.

647
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:41,340
We wanted to maintain control.

648
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,650
Like Aarthi and Andy mentioned,

649
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,650
we get administrative control
over the vSphere clusters

650
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,180
running in EVS.

651
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,813
We can bring our operational cadence,

652
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,890
how we patch, how we
monitor, observability,

653
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,410
security, we were able to extend

654
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,830
what we do on prem to the cloud

655
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,543
and make it more of a hybrid.

656
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,893
Flexible licensing model.

657
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,180
One of the requirements

658
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,890
was to bring-your-own license.

659
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,660
So we were able to bring
our existing VCF license

660
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,493
into EVS.

661
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,643
Multi-layer security.

662
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,850
Because we are able to run in our own VPC,

663
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,840
not only we could use

664
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,990
our existing security guardrails

665
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,787
like SCPs, RCPs, but we could also extend

666
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,373
our NSX security to the cloud.

667
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,320
It was really transformative

668
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,693
when we saw that that was possible.

669
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
Minimizing staff turnover.

670
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,110
One of the requirements
that our management had

671
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,753
was we don't want people leaving us.

672
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,500
Leverage existing skillset

673
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,880
and then slowly upscale as needed.

674
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,033
That was one, and then
EVS made that happen.

675
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,200
Obviously reducing capital expenditure.

676
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,010
You know, we wanted to
go from more of a CapEx

677
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,630
to an OpEx model.

678
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,630
So not having to spend to
buy hardwares and servers

679
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,923
or lease data centers.

680
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:40,830
EVS becomes an OpEx
model, is billed hourly.

681
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,960
We are able to cost manage it.

682
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,110
So that was one of the requirements

683
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,093
around reducing capital expenditure.

684
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,413
Why did we choose EVS?

685
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,690
Like I mentioned, we are able
to run this in our own VPC.

686
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,530
Some of the other competing solutions

687
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,120
we were tied into the vendor-managed VPC,

688
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,060
not giving us enough visibility or control

689
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,910
over what's happening behind the scenes

690
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,203
and what we could do.

691
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,190
Provisioning infrastructure as a code.

692
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,670
We are big into provisioning
everything as a code.

693
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:25,670
So we wanted to leverage
our existing CICD pipelines

694
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,250
for anything that we deploy in the cloud

695
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,033
and EVS had that offering.

696
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,190
I talk about bring-your-own VCF license.

697
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,350
Starting with a pilot light.

698
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,860
Another welcome and a great feature

699
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,980
of EVS is we can start

700
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,310
with a small pilot light cluster

701
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,480
and then we can add nodes as needed.

702
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,280
So you can start with as
small as a four-node cluster

703
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,890
and then you can add and scale up

704
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,990
as you migrate applications

705
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,160
or you put disaster
recovery workloads in it.

706
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,360
And on demand, we could scale out

707
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,220
the number of nodes in the cluster

708
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,753
in an event of a disaster.

709
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,610
Growing iOS ISV partners.

710
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,020
Because we are a heterogeneous
environment on prem,

711
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,120
it was important for us

712
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,570
to maintain the partner ecosystem

713
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,340
that we use on prem.

714
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Whether it's pure storage
or it's FSx on NetApp,

715
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,810
we wanted to keep our
partner ecosystem intact

716
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,400
and have as little changes as possible

717
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,233
when we move the applications.

718
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,090
Automated security provisioning.

719
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,240
We are able to continue using

720
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,820
some of our security tools

721
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,960
that monitor communications and traffic

722
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,810
and they take action
when they see an anomaly

723
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,340
or a threat detection.

724
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,230
So we were able to leverage

725
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,803
and continue automating security.

726
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,753
And the last one is
one flat rate per node.

727
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,490
You know, we are really paying per node,

728
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:28,490
you're not paying per
VM or per EC2 instance.

729
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,780
We are able to run as many VMs as we wish

730
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,750
on a single EVS node

731
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,643
and that was really, really
useful to our use case.

732
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,690
Okay. Lessons learned.

733
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,110
Although this was a successful journey,

734
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,740
we did run into some bumps in the road

735
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,910
and with the help of AWS support,

736
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,450
the account team, and our OEM partners,

737
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,263
we were able to quickly
overcome some of those hurdles.

738
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,130
One was operationalizing EVS.

739
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,630
We had to figure out a way
and build a custom module

740
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,630
to integrate EVS
availability and performance

741
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,273
with our service management back on prem.

742
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,913
Things like monitoring
FSx NetApp performance,

743
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:35,610
or integrating Veeam with
our ticketing system.

744
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,620
There was a learning curve

745
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,403
and it took some time to
really operationalize EVS.

746
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:50,400
One of the issue we had was
figuring out network routing

747
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,240
between the EVS overlay

748
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,753
and the VPC underlay.

749
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,550
Because we have a
sophisticated network topology,

750
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,510
it took us a little while
to figure out routing

751
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:11,530
and put those policies in place

752
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,190
to get the overlay VMs working

753
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,510
with the underlay services, such as EC2,

754
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,483
as well as the on-prem applications.

755
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,590
Data ingress cost.

756
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,860
You know, AWS always
says "Data in is free,

757
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,630
data out will cost you money."

758
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,390
But in this case it was
a bit of a surprise.

759
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,530
But we did see some ingress cost

760
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:45,150
but we were able to work
with our AWS account team

761
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,043
and bring that cost in control.

762
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,060
And CloudFormation.

763
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,733
Because we are not a CloudFormation shop,

764
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:59,880
there was a learning
curve for the NYU team

765
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,063
to use CloudFormation to provision EVS.

766
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,543
Looking ahead.

767
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,590
Today EVS supports Single-AZ,

768
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,640
so we are looking forward
to a Multi-AZ support.

769
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,773
They already have multi-region support.

770
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,620
Looking forward to them
inviting and certifying

771
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,620
more ISV partners as this ecosystem grows.

772
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,953
And looking towards a
Terraform support for EVS.

773
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,480
And back to Aarthi.

774
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,233
- Thank you. Appreciate you
sharing your journey, Jignesh.

775
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,740
So we'll jump into a quick demo.

776
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,123
I'll walk you through the
actual deployment experience.

777
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,110
Okay, so this is the landing
page in the AWS Console.

778
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,990
So as you can see, when
you go into Get Started,

779
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,270
there's a few things
here before deployment

780
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,440
I think we wanna make sure.

781
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,963
There's a lot of information
we collect from you.

782
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,130
Business-level support is minimum required

783
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,020
as part of having EVS.

784
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,280
But we also wanna make sure

785
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
as you think about how to get started,

786
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,580
there's prerequisites.

787
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,440
So we provide you all this information

788
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,110
in terms of what
prerequisites are required

789
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,400
that helps you with planning.

790
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
Because most customers
that we've talked to,

791
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,010
their on-premises team and
their cloud team are different.

792
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,300
There's a separate network team

793
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,910
that handles like IP address spacing.

794
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,620
So it's important to understand

795
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,120
what these prerequisites are.

796
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
So you'll see all that here.

797
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,920
It's divided into like a
four portion of what we need.

798
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,260
EVS also interacts, as you
saw, Compute Network Storage.

799
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,450
It spans across other AWS services.

800
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,550
So we've provided links to other services

801
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,680
that you'll interact with.

802
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,210
So if you go into Environments

803
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,103
and go into Create Environment.

804
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,910
You'll see here, you'll
have to give a name

805
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,870
for your environment.

806
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,180
And then this is where we
collect some basic information.

807
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,350
We're starting with VCF version 5.2.1.

808
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,290
And then as part of your
agreement with Broadcom,

809
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,150
you would have a site ID.

810
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,233
So you'd given a site ID
and provide the solution key

811
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,700
and the vSAN license key.

812
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,470
It's important we do checks

813
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,450
for this solution key and license key.

814
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,760
What this means is you wanna make sure,

815
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,890
if you're deploying a
four-node environment,

816
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,840
you have enough course to support

817
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,003
as part of this key that you are having.

818
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,990
Once you've given the solution key

819
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,500
and license key, and then the next page

820
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,623
is where you deploy the host itself.

821
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,210
So these are the easy two instances.

822
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,670
This is the compute that
I was talking about.

823
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,650
The initial cluster, as I mentioned,

824
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,600
is a four hosts minimum.

825
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,850
And this is all deployed,
as Jignesh was talking,

826
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,980
in a single availability zone.

827
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,090
You do have other options

828
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,030
of choosing placement
group settings, et cetera.

829
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,873
But you can go ahead and
create all the four hosts here.

830
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,523
And then we go into the
actual Network Configuration.

831
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,390
We launched this feature very recently.

832
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,070
For customers that are familiar,

833
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,770
HCX enables you with migration of your VMs

834
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,140
from on premises into EVS.

835
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,330
And you could do it over
private connectivity

836
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,370
either using a direct connect

837
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,020
or using internet connectivity.

838
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,780
So both these options
are available for you.

839
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,750
So this is where you tell
us, "Hey this is my VPC

840
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,780
that I want the EVS environment to be in."

841
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,493
So you select your VPC.

842
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,290
And then you select what we
call a Service Access Subnet.

843
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,350
So EVS deploys it into your account,

844
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,080
so we will have a service access

845
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,180
into your particular
subnet that you choose

846
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,193
and what security group that you select.

847
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,520
And this is a subnet that we use.

848
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,430
And this model is very
typical to other AWS services

849
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,150
like the Network Load
Balancer or RDS for example.

850
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,330
Next comes the actual
VCF connectivity options.

851
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,570
We deploy these stacks,
which means we also take care

852
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,020
of deploying these management
appliances for you.

853
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,390
What we do is, and this is
part of the prerequisite

854
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,360
from an IP planning perspective,
is for you to give us

855
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,500
what cinder blocks are required
in order for us to use that

856
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
as part of the Cloud Builder deployment.

857
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,740
So once you get all those IP
addresses, as you can see here,

858
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,590
I've pre-filled some of these things.

859
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,590
And this is where you select
what that route server.

860
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,480
You would have to create
your route server endpoint

861
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,880
and tell us which route
server peering to use.

862
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,430
So you could select the
route server peerings here.

863
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,223
And then go into your Next.

864
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,520
And then this is standard DNS host name.

865
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,640
You could either use Route
53 or your on-premises DNS.

866
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,060
We ask for DNS host names
for your appliances.

867
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,440
So once you get your DNS host names

868
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,920
and the last page is just tags.

869
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,140
So you'll see, you'll have an ability

870
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,430
to review all these settings.

871
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,710
It's important to note
some of those IP addresses

872
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,760
for those appliances.

873
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,290
You cannot come and edit it.

874
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,270
So it's important to just be sure

875
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,190
you are filling in the right information

876
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,600
as you go through this.

877
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,060
So once you give us this,
we collect all of this

878
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,160
and our control plane, our service,

879
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,070
takes care of all this
bootstrapping this information

880
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,600
and deploying it for you.

881
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,643
The typical deployment time today,

882
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,170
it takes approximately three hours.

883
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,600
And this involves building the VCF stack,

884
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,490
getting the host up and running.

885
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,200
So at the end when you
see the environment,

886
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,973
when we hand it off to you,

887
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,100
you can immediately log into
your V center (indistinct).

888
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,470
Credentials are managed in KMS.

889
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,490
So I've just recorded this
so that I can show you,

890
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,110
but let me just show you an environment

891
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,523
that I've created to show.

892
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,030
This is an environment that I've created.

893
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,080
So you would see here

894
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,800
that the details of the
environment are here,

895
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,850
this is what you gave us.

896
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,670
So you gave us what the
hosts are, what the keys are.

897
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,050
So we go ahead, and you'll see

898
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,670
this is a standard EC2 instance.

899
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,133
It's got an instance
ID associated with it.

900
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,920
We deploy these hosts for you.

901
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,380
You will also see this
is where you provided us

902
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,650
your network configurations from your VPC

903
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,650
to what service access
subnet and route server.

904
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,290
And then you'll see the VLANs
that we've created for you.

905
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,230
So these are the 10 VLANs that Amazon,

906
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,760
you will see this in your account,

907
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,913
and these are created in a
special subnet that you see here.

908
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,970
And then the DNS host
names are also available.

909
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,820
- For anybody who's done
a deployment on premises,

910
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,550
these VLANs all probably look
very familiar to you, right?

911
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,050
This is the same thing
that you would deploy

912
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,550
in an on-prem environment.

913
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,350
So really, the difference here

914
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,510
is rather than racking
and stacking, cabling,

915
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,850
having your network team
configure everything,

916
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,070
you're providing just
the logical information,

917
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,230
the IP subnets, those types
of things, click and deploy.

918
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,330
But this is nothing kind of special

919
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,380
from a cloud perspective.

920
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,420
This is really the same
stuff you would use

921
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,953
in a on-premises deployment.

922
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,190
- And then you should be able to log in.

923
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,470
Once this is available in your
account, you should be able

924
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,170
to log into your SDC
Manager or NSX Manager

925
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,090
and continue your day two operations

926
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,440
like you would normally do.

927
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,840
So that wraps up our demo.

928
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,480
We do have a lineup of sessions this week.

929
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,300
And as I was talking earlier,

930
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,920
this is an introductory-level session,

931
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,500
but you can see here,
there's very specific

932
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,410
storage-based sessions or
networking-based sessions

933
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:47,310
that are related to EVS and
migrations throughout the week.

934
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,620
So feel free to take a look
at some of these sessions.

935
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,020
Some of the Chalk Talks are
not going to be recorded,

936
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,720
so I highly recommend doing
some of these Chalk Talks.

937
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,950
These are smaller sessions

938
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,040
where you can dive as
much as detail as you want

939
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,633
depending on what you have.

940
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,370
We do have a Getting Started Guide

941
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,010
and that Deployment Prerequisite Checklist

942
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,470
that I was talking about,
so take a look at it.

943
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,610
And Andy and I, we do
this session every year,

944
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,880
so if you have any feedback,
we take it very seriously.

945
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,880
So please make sure to
give us some feedback.

946
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,890
It should be available on the app.

947
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,840
We're gonna be hanging
out after this session.

948
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,110
We do have some time, so happy
to take some Q and A as well.

949
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,110
Jignesh is also going to be
here, so if you wanna talk

950
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,660
to any of us, come chat with us.

951
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,960
And really, really appreciate.
I know it's a long week.

952
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,510
There's a lot of other fun announcements.

953
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,997
The only AI we could include
in our session is Andy's couch.

954
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:43,980
- Okay.

955
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,750
- But there's a lot of good announcements

956
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,800
and keynotes coming up.

957
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,200
So appreciate all of you
showing up on a Monday morning

958
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,033
to this session.

959
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:50,866
Thank you.

960
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:51,699
- A couple of big takeaways

961
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,400
or things I just want you to
think about as you're leaving.

962
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,380
Like one of the questions
we get asked a lot

963
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,677
as we're talking with folks is like,

964
00:44:56,677 --> 00:44:58,650
"When would I want to use this?"

965
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,193
And as Jignesh mentioned,

966
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:02,850
a key thing for when
you wanna consider EVS

967
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,560
is when speed matters.

968
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,000
Aarthi and I have conversations,

969
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,270
I think probably at least
once a week, if not more,

970
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,280
where customers say "My
data center contract

971
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,300
is coming up for renewal.

972
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,340
And I need to be completely
outta my data center

973
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,420
in six months."

974
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,300
Or, "My server support is
running up in three months.

975
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,950
And I need to be out of it very quickly."

976
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,680
So a big case for using
EVS, when speed matters,

977
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,600
when you need to move
from point A to point B

978
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,810
very, very quickly, this is
definitely the fastest way

979
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,190
to get from point A to point B

980
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,630
while maintaining all the kind of people,

981
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,050
process and technology aspects
of it that are the same.

982
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,520
The real secret sauce of this,

983
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,650
what allows us to happen
is you do not have,

984
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,690
we didn't cover this
tremendously in the networking,

985
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,800
but I would encourage you

986
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,350
to go to the deep-dive
sessions if you can.

987
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,120
Some of the kind of real magic of this

988
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,060
is the ability to actually
extend those layer two networks

989
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,850
from your on-premises
environments into the cloud.

990
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,650
This means you do not have to change

991
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,650
the IP addresses of the
VMs as you move them.

992
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,790
And when we talk with customers,

993
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,500
this is one of the biggest
things that they come up with,

994
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,840
is "If I don't have to
change the IP addresses,

995
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,420
it reduces my testing burden,
it allows my app teams

996
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,090
to do less work, and I can
move much, much faster."

997
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,370
Again, we were trying to
provide much of a higher level,

998
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,670
this is what it is and how it
works at a very high level.

999
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,590
If you can attend some of
those deep-dive sessions,

1000
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,180
they'll go into a lot more detail

1001
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,160
of some of the magic behind this

1002
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,310
and being able to literally
use VMware's HCX technology

1003
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,190
to move the VM from on
premises into the cloud

1004
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,110
without changing IP addresses,

1005
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,300
with very, very minimal downtime,

1006
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,710
and being able to do that very quickly.

1007
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,420
So encourage you guys to check that out

1008
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,970
and I'll just echo what Aarthi says.

1009
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,803
Thank you so much.

1010
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:34,890
We would really, really appreciate it

1011
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,270
if you could provide us feedback.

1012
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,380
We hope you learned something.

1013
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,490
And again, we'll hang out down here

1014
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,440
and we're happy to answer
any questions that you have.

1015
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,820
Thank you all. Have a
great rest of your week.

1016
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,870
- [Aarthi] Thank you.
