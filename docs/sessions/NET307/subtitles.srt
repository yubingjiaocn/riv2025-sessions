1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,380
- So good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,780
Thanks for joining us today.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,873
For this session,

4
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,680
we're gonna be predominantly talking about

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,853
streaming at scale,

6
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:12,390
and focusing really on Amazon CloudFront

7
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,070
to do that delivery.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,270
So my name's Jamie Mullan,

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,667
I'm a specialist solutions
architect here at AWS.

10
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,860
And I'm joined buying my
colleague John Councilman,

11
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,811
who is also another specialist
solutions architect.

12
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:26,190
And with Jes Palmer, who is from NESN

13
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,490
to talk about what scale
really means to them.

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,140
So we're gonna be
thinking about, you know,

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,310
those live scale...

16
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,810
Large scale events, sorry.

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,400
Those critical events

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
that just must be delivered
without any issues.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,360
And also those events with
many, many viewers globally.

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,410
But it's easy, right?

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,880
You have a contribution feed,

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,180
you do some processing on it,

23
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,720
and it just goes to a viewer.

24
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,553
That's it.

25
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,690
What else do you really need? (laughing)

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,300
Well, it is a little bit
more complicated than that.

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,590
And we're gonna look at,

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,360
you know, some of those design decisions

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,783
that kind of help you
influence that delivery.

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,860
But scale can mean different
things to different customers.

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,890
For example, it could be
millions of concurrent viewers

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,130
or it could be billions
of minutes consumed.

33
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,810
But no matter the scale,

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,360
we frequently get asked by customers

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,670
like, how do I monitor my distribution?

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,920
How do I protect my content at the edge?

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,050
How do I scale to that global audience

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,520
with that high uptime?

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,223
And finally, can I
monetize that live content?

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,170
You might be wondering,

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,600
like what architectural
decisions do I need to make

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,159
to make sure an event is successful?

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
Glad to say you're in the
right session this morning.

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,045
But what happens if we get our
job wrong as video architects

45
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:46,170
or solutions architects
and video engineers?

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,780
Well, viewers might get pixelation,

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,340
degraded viewer experience,

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,886
and/or arguably, my personal
most frustrating experience

49
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,523
is that spinning buffer wheel.

50
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,060
So we're gonna be focused predominantly

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,730
on delivering content through
Amazon CloudFront today.

52
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,563
If you don't know,

53
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:06,540
CloudFront is our content
delivery network, or CDN.

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,460
CloudFront is a large global network

55
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,400
with over 750 edge locations.

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,420
All the edge locations

57
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,480
are connected over a
redundant and private backbone

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,970
back to AWS regions.

59
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,640
And CloudFront can be used to accelerate

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,470
applications of all types,

61
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,133
whether that's static assets
like video files, image files,

62
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,890
CSS, JavaScript.

63
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,050
And they can be cached in edge locations,

64
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,993
and delivered really
closer to those end users.

65
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,260
CloudFront could also be used

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,243
for dynamic traffic requests too.

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,260
So the talk is gonna kind of revolve

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,720
around this steel thread
architecture today.

69
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,930
And we're gonna look at
different design decisions

70
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,980
throughout the workflow.

71
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,242
Advanced warnings toward the
video folk in the audience,

72
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,633
we're gonna start downstream this time.

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,680
So first off, we're
gonna look at delivery.

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,110
You know, some OTT providers

75
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,460
deliver these streams for a cost,

76
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,710
whether that's subscription
or pay-per-view.

77
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,098
So you naturally care
about, you know, security,

78
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,763
protecting their content.

79
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,230
Next we're gonna look
at encode origination.

80
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,980
So for big events or big
sporting events in particular,

81
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,560
this is really, really
critical and important.

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,970
You want to design your workflow

83
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,060
to ensure the event is
successfully delivered...

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,560
Delivered successfully, sorry.

85
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,070
And then finally, we're
gonna look at ingest.

86
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,592
Simply put, if you have no
feed, you have no event, right?

87
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,130
So we'll explore different ways

88
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,173
to make ingest more reliable.

89
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,780
But the first thing that
we're gonna kick off with

90
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,800
is monitoring.

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
And I ask that question,

92
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,560
how do we know

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,623
we're actually delivering
that event successfully?

94
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,280
- Okay, thanks Jamie.

95
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,147
My name is John Councilman.

96
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,897
I'm a solutions architect with AWS.

97
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,150
And we wanna look at how can we gauge

98
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,720
whether our live event was successful.

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,810
As you can see here,

100
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,200
there's a lot of data available
to us from our platform.

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,990
Things like exit errors, video
start failures, rebuffering.

102
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,330
A lot of this stuff either
comes from the client itself,

103
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,530
the video player,

104
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,690
or it's coming from CloudFront.

105
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,451
So this might be presented as logs,

106
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,150
it might be beacons.

107
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,500
It's coming from a lot
of different directions.

108
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,680
We have a lot of data, which
is good, but it's also bad.

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,170
We have a lot of data, how
do we deal with it all?

110
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,170
So we're gonna look into
some features on CloudFront

111
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,420
and some other AWS services

112
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,263
to see how we can actually
make sense of everything here.

113
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,550
So first off, every event needs good data.

114
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,900
We need a dashboard,

115
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,060
we need real time access to logs,

116
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,470
and we need to be able to
analyze the event after the fact.

117
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,351
So first off, with metrics,

118
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:56,351
CloudFront actually uses
CloudWatch to deliver metrics.

119
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,943
So I like to use CloudWatch dashboards,

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,530
kind of I compare it to an
actual dashboard like on my car.

121
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,780
When we go camping, we
actually pull a trailer.

122
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,750
And I'm constantly looking at
two gauges on my dashboard.

123
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,980
I'm looking at the fuel level

124
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,380
because I'm getting like five
miles per gallon on my car,

125
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,990
and I'm also looking at the
transmission temperature.

126
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,980
So if there's an issue,

127
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,540
'cause I don't normally
pull a camper every day,

128
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,460
I know exactly what to look at.

129
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,540
I know if it gets too hot,

130
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,860
I don't need to put gas in the car,

131
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,100
it's actually the transmission
I need to pull over.

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,495
So the same is true for a streaming event.

133
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,750
Most of these only last a few hours.

134
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,880
In the case of like a sports event,

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
we need to know right away

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,820
whether we have a problem with an origin,

137
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,780
whether it's CloudFront

138
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,210
or if we're using something
like DRM or advertising,

139
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,520
whether there's a problem with
that affecting our stream.

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,320
So dashboards are the
first line of defense,

141
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,670
so we know where to look,
where to dive deeper.

142
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,290
Just speaking of diving deeper,

143
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,080
CloudFront, it supports
real time access logs.

144
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,130
And as you can see here,

145
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,040
it actually uses Amazon
Kinesis to deliver this.

146
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,660
It's delivering realtime
logs for millions of viewers,

147
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,420
which is extremely difficult.

148
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,120
Kinesis is designed exactly for this.

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
So when you configure
realtime logs in CloudFront,

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,590
it's gonna ask for a Kinesis endpoint.

151
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,090
And the nice thing about Kinesis

152
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,070
is you can have multiple consumers

153
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,230
pulling that data in parallel.

154
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,570
So we can have realtime dashboards,

155
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,570
we can have observability
platforms, analytics platforms.

156
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,270
We can also share this data
in real time with partners,

157
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,250
whether they're looking
at viewership in real time

158
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,770
or they're looking at advertising data

159
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,500
and they need that
information in real time.

160
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,180
So then with this real time data,

161
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,700
we can see issues before
they become a big problem

162
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,570
and react to it.

163
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,649
And we can adjust our platform
in real time as needed

164
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,803
to handle these largest events.

165
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,887
Then lastly, access logs.

166
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,237
These are stored in batches on S3.

167
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:50,523
As you can see here, the delay
is usually in the minutes.

168
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,810
Nice thing about S3 is we can...

169
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,220
We can tie Athena into it

170
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,130
so we can query all these
logs using standard SQL.

171
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,530
And we can set life
cycles on the S3 bucket.

172
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,490
So we can have events from
weeks or even years ago

173
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,078
stored in archival.

174
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,710
So we can compare this previous event

175
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,620
to one that we did, you know,
maybe a week or a month ago,

176
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,940
and see how we've improved

177
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,250
and find out lessons learned.

178
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,080
We can do some
troubleshooting after the fact

179
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,380
and we can pull reporting
easily using Athena.

180
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,261
And then lastly, console reports.

181
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:28,140
This is in the CloudFront console

182
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,610
and is useful for just, you know,

183
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,321
figuring out trends, viewership,

184
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:35,490
cache fill ratio between
events and monthly reports.

185
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,240
So that's always available as well.

186
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,530
Okay.

187
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,379
Next, I spoke a lot about
CloudFront and its logs.

188
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,770
But typically CloudFront only has access

189
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,639
to things that are in the
HTTP header or geo information

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,340
such as the user agent,

191
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,827
the client's IP address,
maybe the geo region,

192
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:58,050
the ASN, cache status.

193
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,880
And this has always been logged,

194
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,940
whether it's in real time
logs or in the S3 logs.

195
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,610
But I mentioned earlier about the client.

196
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,729
The client has a lot of
really valuable information

197
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,650
such as like the throughput.

198
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,650
The client being the player
like dash.js or hls.js,

199
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,790
it's making decisions

200
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,800
about which video bit rate to pull

201
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,060
based on what it knows your
home internet bandwidth is.

202
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,564
And having that kind of information

203
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,720
along with session ID and content ID

204
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,230
is extremely valuable for
figuring out what's going on.

205
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,062
But in the past, this
information was only available

206
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,900
using like SDKs from third parties,

207
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,350
and it was sending it using
beacons to some other platform.

208
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,710
So you had CloudFront or
CDN logs in one bucket,

209
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,170
then you had all the player
information in another bucket,

210
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,330
and really no way to tie the two together.

211
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,509
And trust me it's extremely
difficult to do that.

212
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,550
It can be done but it's not easy.

213
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,510
But what if there were a way

214
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,970
to combine all this client information

215
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,814
such as you know, the bit rate
being used, the session ID,

216
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:01,135
which rendition,

217
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:04,230
whether it's HD or standard
definition content,

218
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,320
and combine that with all the information

219
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,460
that CloudFront knows about,

220
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,050
such as HTTP headers, you
know, user agent IP address.

221
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,320
And that's exactly what CMCD,
Common Media Client Data

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,153
attempts to solve.

223
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:20,520
It's actually a standard now
that was created by CTA Wave,

224
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,050
which has created a lot of other standards

225
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,910
that Jamie's gonna talk about later,

226
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,010
that pretty much all CDNs adhere to

227
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,110
and the players know about.

228
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,378
So using CMCD, all this information...

229
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:32,520
(audience applauds)

230
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,740
All this information is
kept in the same log line.

231
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,900
So all this content ID, session ID,

232
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,870
is transmitted as query
strings or headers to the CDN.

233
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,980
And since it's standardized,

234
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,020
we know what to do with it already.

235
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,449
And a lot of partners

236
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,305
that you might be using
for a monitoring platform

237
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,333
already know how to deal with CMCD.

238
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,543
So CloudFront has supported
CMCD for quite a while.

239
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,012
If you look here on the left,

240
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:59,430
this is a realtime log configuration.

241
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,170
You can see here, we
have additional fields

242
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,150
that are standard CMCD fields.

243
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,340
They're all prefixed with CMCD.

244
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,920
And you can just choose
some of them or all of them

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,660
depending on what your client's sending.

246
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,572
And all this information will
be added to the realtime logs

247
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,730
that we're sending through to Kinesis.

248
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,599
And again, a lot of partners
already support this

249
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,930
on their logging platforms.

250
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,880
And we actually have a reference sample

251
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,713
that already knows

252
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,160
how to deal with this
additional information

253
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,090
in the log lines.

254
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,840
And it has a realtime dashboard

255
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,448
that actually refreshes in real time

256
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:29,640
based on all this data

257
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,080
to show exactly what's happening

258
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,810
with the client and with the CDN.

259
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,850
So you can scan the QR code here

260
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,023
or just search for the video observability

261
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:40,170
with CMCD and CloudFront,

262
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,850
and try it out on your own distribution

263
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,493
being a reference sample
that's free to use,

264
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,070
and you can edit it at
Willow's open source.

265
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:49,942
(coughs)

266
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:50,775
Excuse me.

267
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,608
So it is easy.

268
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:52,530
CMCD is easy.

269
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,530
Again, you saw it on the realtime logs.

270
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,261
In CloudFront, it's just
adding those additional fills

271
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,220
and having a consumer dashboard

272
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,200
that knows how to access it.

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,160
This is an example

274
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,010
on some of the players
you might be using today.

275
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,900
These are two popular open source players,

276
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,780
hls.js and dash.js.

277
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,343
And as you can see here,

278
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,220
configuring CMCD

279
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,560
is just a matter of adding
a few more key value pairs

280
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,380
when you instantiate your player.

281
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,910
In the case of hls.js,

282
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,833
which is one I'm very familiar with,

283
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,350
it's just a CMCD structure.

284
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,840
But notice specifically on the left,

285
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
we have a session ID now.

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,040
That's actually a common
or standard CMCD field,

287
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,850
which is extremely useful.

288
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,210
If you are using CMCD and
not using session ID today,

289
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,950
how I suggest you do it,

290
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,783
that's usually pulled

291
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,620
from like your content management system

292
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,389
for that particular user
when they start a session.

293
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,930
When you include this
session ID in a field,

294
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,390
you actually can find all the logs

295
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,890
that are tied to a specific user.

296
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,960
So you can see individual user's journey

297
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,690
from starting to playback
your stream till end.

298
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,610
How many times they switched bit rates,

299
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,770
rebuffered, stalled, all that.

300
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,830
So you can figure out
individual user journeys

301
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,220
and use the same information

302
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,790
to find other users' journeys
as well based on session ID,

303
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,170
which wasn't possible before

304
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,380
since the client information
and the CD information

305
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,180
were stored in separate locations,

306
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,480
so it makes it super easy.

307
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,690
Okay, so now this is
security requirements.

308
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,013
We talked about logging.

309
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,750
We've vetted visibility

310
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,700
to our CloudFront distribution.

311
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,890
We wanna make sure all of our users,

312
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,820
our valid users are receiving
the best possible experience.

313
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,990
But we don't want our invalid users

314
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,691
that are trying to steal our streams,

315
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,170
take down our...

316
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,720
You know, steal our content
or take down our streams.

317
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,660
We really wanna stop them
from receiving our content

318
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,790
and harming the experience

319
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,463
that other users are experiencing.

320
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,390
So what do these users look like?

321
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,236
Well, ideally in a perfect world

322
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,360
you'd have your origin
server behind CloudFront,

323
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,620
you'd have CloudFront
delivering a standard URL,

324
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,500
in this case it's HLS and index.m3u8.

325
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,410
And all of your paid or subscribed users

326
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,613
would pull the content.

327
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,223
That's not the case, as we all know.

328
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:17,940
We see users that are trying
to re-stream the content.

329
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,740
So they're a paid valid user

330
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,390
coming from maybe a particular IP address,

331
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,790
pulling our content and then
re-streaming it to their users

332
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,240
who are probably paying them.

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,633
Obviously, we don't want that.

334
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,423
And then invalid regions.

335
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,830
Not only have we not really
designed our infrastructure

336
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,879
to maybe operate in a different country

337
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,105
for scalability purposes,

338
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:42,303
when we have viewers from invalid regions,

339
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:43,710
they're messing up our stats.

340
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,540
So they might be having a bad experience

341
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,900
and it's going to mess up
our analysis of how our...

342
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
You know, whether our
event was a success or not.

343
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,430
If we see viewers coming
from outside of the country

344
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,840
with high latency numbers,

345
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,290
that's gonna affect all of our reporting.

346
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,372
And then lastly,

347
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,920
Jes is gonna talk about it in a little bit

348
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,690
with rights holders.

349
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,220
There might be even legal consequences

350
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,590
of delivering content
outside of your country

351
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,140
where your contract states

352
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,910
that you can only deliver
in a certain region,

353
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,850
you only have rights to deliver
in maybe a specific state.

354
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,800
In the case of sporting events
or maybe a specific country.

355
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,161
I know in the past dealing
with some customers

356
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,860
when the Olympics are involved,

357
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,800
the contract for theirs
is extremely specific

358
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,170
when it comes to regions

359
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,200
and the security required
to deliver that content.

360
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,110
So again, rights holders
are very important as well.

361
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,670
And then lastly, unpaid users

362
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,620
that have found the way around
any CloudFront restrictions

363
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,350
and are able to go directly to the origin.

364
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,270
So obviously, we don't want that,

365
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,030
but also if you're able to
go directly to the origin,

366
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,710
it's going to affect the
experience of everybody

367
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,290
'cause the origin should be
protected behind CloudFront,

368
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,880
where CloudFront serves

369
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,430
99 plus percent of the
traffic from its cache.

370
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,300
So the origin server

371
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,500
should never be delivering
content directly.

372
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,933
Okay, so what tools do
we have available to us?

373
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,500
So first of all, my son, he's seven.

374
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,349
He's actually been home
from school recently

375
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:09,000
on vacation for break.

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,770
And he tends to find ways

377
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,767
to stream YouTube when
he is not supposed to.

378
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:17,220
So I've tried the firewall
rules on my home internet.

379
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,490
And eventually ended up
just locking the remotes

380
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,410
in the office and networks.

381
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,520
So that's the tools I have.

382
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,690
But obviously on CloudFront

383
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,940
we don't have physical locking keys,

384
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,390
but we do have some ways
to restrict traffic.

385
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,650
So first off,

386
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,600
for anybody that's been
in the CloudFront console,

387
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,150
you've probably noticed the
geo restrictions built in.

388
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,335
So that's just built into the
distribution in the console

389
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,830
through the API if you're using that.

390
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,442
So this is a way

391
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,090
to quickly allow or
disallow specific regions.

392
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,187
So if I'm delivering content

393
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,480
that's only allowed

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,670
to be delivered in the
United States, for instance.

395
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,990
I can go into CloudFront

396
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,410
and quickly add geo restrictions
to only allow the US,

397
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,253
or I could block specific
countries within there.

398
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,550
But the next layer we
can add on top of that,

399
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,870
the next tool in our tool chain

400
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,813
is AWS Web Application Firewall, WAF.

401
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,860
So in this case, we can
inspect anything coming in,

402
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,993
whether it's headers, IP addresses,

403
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,590
against a list.

404
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,960
And we also have lists
that you can subscribe to.

405
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,040
So we have to manage lists.

406
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,030
So we're already able to
allow specific regions

407
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,870
with geo restrictions,

408
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,220
but what about users who are using

409
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,610
maybe VPNs or proxies
to access our stream?

410
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,080
Using WAF, we can actually subscribe

411
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,880
the list of known VPN endpoints,

412
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
known proxy endpoints.

413
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,990
Or in the case of the re-streamer,

414
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,960
we found there that our IP address,

415
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,000
in the case of the example was 1, 2, 3, 4.

416
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,640
During the event, we can
actually add that IP address

417
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,630
to our own managed list

418
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,630
to block that user that's a re-streamer.

419
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,990
So WAF is really useful for
before, during, and after event.

420
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,910
So if you notice something specific,

421
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,580
you can add rules after the
fact for your next event.

422
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,990
Or in the case of the re-streamer,

423
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,930
you can actually modify
it during the event.

424
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,763
And then lastly,

425
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:04,740
for anything above and beyond
geo restrictions and WAF,

426
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,090
we have functions.

427
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,350
So CloudFront functions

428
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,330
run as JavaScript
actually on the ad server.

429
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,900
They're extremely low
latency and high performant.

430
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,880
And you're able to analyze the request

431
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,360
and/or responses coming from CloudFront

432
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,950
or to and from the origin.

433
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,560
And we've added key value stores as well.

434
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,179
So you're able to add data
to the key value store

435
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:26,550
using the API

436
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,350
and query that on edge function.

437
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,760
So we're gonna go into detail

438
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,020
about what this can be used for

439
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,920
when it comes to security in a minute.

440
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,023
So how do we secure our origin?

441
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,091
So as we all know, CloudFront
is origin agnostic.

442
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:44,160
So the origin could be anywhere, really.

443
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,620
So first off, if our origin is on-prem,

444
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,240
it's most likely on a public subnet.

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,320
So we obviously don't want
users to access that directly

446
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,180
so that again, it affects
the experience for everybody.

447
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,950
So the first thing we can do

448
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,687
is when you configure
your origin in CloudFront,

449
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,610
you can leverage HTTP headers.

450
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,750
That's then the origin level.

451
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,390
You can send a secret
header to the origin,

452
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,560
which the origin can validate

453
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,140
that this is actually in
fact coming from CloudFront.

454
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,973
And then you can also...

455
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:08,880
We also publish a list

456
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,250
of known IP addresses of
CloudFront edge servers

457
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,930
that you can add to your firewall on-prem

458
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,130
or on the origin itself

459
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,220
to allow only CloudFront to access it.

460
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,063
And then second,

461
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,330
if you're using something like
an application load balancer

462
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,380
or network load balancer,

463
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,833
maybe EC2 instances behind
those for your origin,

464
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,130
CloudFront now can leverage VPC Origins.

465
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,440
I don't know if everybody's aware of that.

466
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,973
And recently we've even
introduced cross region...

467
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,190
Cross account, sorry.

468
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,050
Cross account VPC Origins.

469
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,880
So if you're using multiple accounts,

470
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,530
CloudFront can access these origins

471
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,197
on a VPC from other accounts,

472
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:46,200
whether your accounts or
even partners' accounts,

473
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,033
which is huge,

474
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,871
'cause if your origin's not
even on a public subnet,

475
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:51,330
it can't be accessed in the first place.

476
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,260
And then lastly,

477
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,210
for some of our managed
services delivery media,

478
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,586
a lot of you use S3 for live
and on-demand media delivery

479
00:18:56,586 --> 00:19:00,030
as well as elemental media package.

480
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,130
These can use origin access control.

481
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,750
So those are rule sets

482
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,610
that specifically allow only CloudFront

483
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,003
to access the content using signed URLs.

484
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,780
So I mentioned functions to take...

485
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,181
To basically expand upon security

486
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:18,259
above and beyond WAF and geo restrictions.

487
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,259
We see a lot of customers use
tokenization within functions

488
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,080
to further secure content.

489
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,043
So a token,

490
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,670
it's actually typically we see JWT used,

491
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,200
but there's quite a few formats out there.

492
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,550
And using functions, we're flexible.

493
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,600
You can basically implement

494
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,750
any sort of function
mechanism that you'd like,

495
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,460
whether it's JWT or some custom function

496
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,650
or some custom token that
you use across other CDNs.

497
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,853
So inside the token it
basically describes who you are,

498
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,920
what you're able to
watch, like a content ID,

499
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,390
and it would have a time limit.

500
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,190
So in case of JWT,

501
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,600
it's very easy to set a lifetime

502
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,620
that this token's only valid

503
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,320
for an hour, two hours, a full day.

504
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,270
And then it also provides,

505
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,570
you know, instructions on
where and what you can watch.

506
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,210
So ideally a user with a valid token,

507
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,890
they're sending all
this header information

508
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,840
and IP address information
in the CloudFront.

509
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,111
We're able to look up
their geo information

510
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,620
using geo headers,

511
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,402
they're configuring CloudFront.

512
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:17,070
And the token contains
all this information,

513
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,980
that they're able to watch
from a specific maybe US state,

514
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,240
that they're tied

515
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,820
to this particular IP
address or user agent.

516
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,650
And the function is
gonna validate all this

517
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,620
against the token and what
CloudFront knows about the user.

518
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,880
And if everything matches up,

519
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,901
the token wasn't modified
in transit from the user,

520
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,380
and the token hasn't expired,

521
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,233
then we just return a 200
OK within the function.

522
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,002
And then we have users
with invalid tokens.

523
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:42,270
Maybe they modify...

524
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,530
They tried to modify their token

525
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,490
and create their own token

526
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,220
and it's invalid 'cause
that wasn't signed correctly

527
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,130
or they're coming from
an invalid location.

528
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,702
You know, they may be
traveled with a valid token,

529
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,338
we signed it for their home use

530
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:57,030
on their cellular network

531
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,950
and they didn't receive a new token.

532
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,000
We'll actually return back

533
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,780
a manufacturer 401 unauthorized response

534
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,860
from the function itself

535
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,210
and immediately deny that user

536
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,960
before they even hit CloudFront
in their origin server.

537
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,780
And then lastly, we have a
user here with a share token.

538
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,180
Again, all these examples are using JWT,

539
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,470
which is really common,

540
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,840
which is easily implemented in functions.

541
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,160
This user has a shared token,

542
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,220
so they received the valid
token from the first user

543
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,870
and they're trying to reuse it,

544
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,940
and they might be living
in the same neighborhood

545
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,990
and using the same device,

546
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,660
so it happens to be valid for some reason.

547
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,143
But we noticed that this user...

548
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:34,992
This token is being used multiple
times and it's not valid.

549
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:37,590
We can actually add this token value

550
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,880
into the key value store.

551
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,440
So that's for us at a good use case

552
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,190
for key value stores and
functions is token revocation.

553
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,590
So you can insert this
token into a key value store

554
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,240
when you notice something wrong with it,

555
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,950
and it's just being used too many times.

556
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,500
And then you can have the
function return a 403 forbidden

557
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,080
if that token's in that key value store.

558
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,020
So again, this is a common
use case that we see

559
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,840
for tokenization JWT tokens.

560
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,420
But actually, we've recently
right before re:Invent

561
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,950
released CBO token support,

562
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,710
which is needed by the
common access tokens,

563
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,990
which again was created by CTA Wave.

564
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,410
So instead of having to
figure out how to write

565
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,640
a full token authentication
workflow in functions,

566
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,890
you can just tie directly into CBO,

567
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,740
which is supported as
a module in functions.

568
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,590
And the code is extremely minimal,

569
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,840
I was using it earlier and
it was just a few lines.

570
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,730
So that's natively supported now.

571
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,681
And against common access tokens

572
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,510
seems to be where the industry's headed

573
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,360
because it has been standardized now.

574
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,600
So we do have guidance

575
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
for security delivery at the edge on AWS.

576
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,060
So this takes all the work
we've done on functions

577
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,893
and does it for you.

578
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,430
So you can simply deploy this

579
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,440
onto your CloudFront distribution.

580
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,030
And we're going to
deploy all the functions

581
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,220
supporting JWT token support.

582
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,804
And we have a step function
available that's also deployed

583
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,057
that can automatically replicate tokens

584
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:00,755
that are being used incorrectly,

585
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,780
either multiple times
or from invalid users.

586
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,145
And we've even added a
full playback application,

587
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,500
sample application with video players

588
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,790
so you can try it out.

589
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,170
So you can just deploy this

590
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,099
using cloud formation
on your own distribution

591
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:17,880
and being open source,
you can modify it at will.

592
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,494
We even included SDKs

593
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:21,330
for your content management system

594
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,159
to create tokens and sign tokens

595
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,710
when you create playback URLs.

596
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,690
So check it out if you haven't.

597
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,460
And we're actually enabling support

598
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,241
for common access tokens
in this really soon.

599
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:33,193
That's coming shortly.

600
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:37,473
So yeah, just keep an eye
on it for the updates.

601
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,010
Okay, so I'm gonna hand it back to Jamie

602
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,383
for a talk on last mile capacity.

603
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,190
- So large scale...

604
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,023
Large scale events

605
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,831
can generate significant
internet traffic spikes

606
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:51,840
over a really short period of time,

607
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,370
with strained network links

608
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,503
that connect viewers to end content.

609
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,660
However, there might actually

610
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,010
only be a certain amount of capacity

611
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,950
between an internet exchange itself

612
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,470
and an ISP or a smaller city.

613
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,770
For example, ISPs continuously
optimize their networks,

614
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,510
but scaling capacity

615
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,760
for like those last minute big events

616
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,610
is understandably challenging, right?

617
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,570
Especially those events

618
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,010
that you know, you only need that capacity

619
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,510
for that short period of time.

620
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,467
When a network becomes
saturated or congested,

621
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:26,160
both packet loss and
increased latencies can occur.

622
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,750
And a result on the viewer experience

623
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,360
is things like quality drops, rebuffering,

624
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,013
or even those playback failures.

625
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,610
Remember, you can lean on
that monitoring approach

626
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,810
that John spoke about earlier

627
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,570
to try and help you identify
some of these issues.

628
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,310
But unless you own the network

629
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,040
or the underlying network
as an ATT provider,

630
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,873
this is something

631
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,850
that is really largely
out of your control.

632
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,350
Last year, however,

633
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,480
we introduced Embedded POPs.

634
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,740
And they overcome this challenge

635
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,170
by getting you closer
to those end viewers,

636
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,366
caching content directly
inside an ISP network,

637
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:03,630
and removing some of the
dependency on the network links

638
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,720
between the viewers and
the internet exchange.

639
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,700
If you didn't see it
on the POP map before,

640
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,240
we've got over 1,140 embedded POPs

641
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,440
across over a hundred ISPs
in more than 20 countries.

642
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,400
Because that distance to end
viewers is reduced further,

643
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,870
customers have already...

644
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,030
Customers that already
adopted in embedded POPs

645
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,193
have seen performance improvements too.

646
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,610
Because we're able to remove
some of the network dependency,

647
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,060
they're really great for
highly cachable content.

648
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,140
So we are very focused

649
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,330
on the media and entertainment
space today, obviously.

650
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,590
But you can also use them

651
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,630
for things like or
content like game delivery

652
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,223
and also software downloads.

653
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,510
So as part of the
onboarding of Embedded POPs,

654
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,870
we validate the workflow that
you want to use them for.

655
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,421
If it is a good fit,

656
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:57,150
the distribution is enabled
up by us in the backend.

657
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,300
However, there is some additional
work required on your side

658
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,890
to make sure your client application

659
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,110
can route to Embedded POPs.

660
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,520
The way that we recommend doing this

661
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,190
is integrating the client routing SDK

662
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,023
into your URL vending service.

663
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,980
So how does this work?

664
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,110
Well firstly, you need
to do that integration

665
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,950
of that client routing SDK
into your Euro vending service.

666
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,300
The QR code on the bottom right

667
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,540
is actually the link
to that SDK in GitHub,

668
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,480
if you're interested in
having a look at that.

669
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,010
So when the client application

670
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,680
requests a URL from that vending service,

671
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,760
the client in...

672
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,850
The client IP is encoded into the URL,

673
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,553
and it's annotated a CR
label in this diagram.

674
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,347
The client then performs a DNS lookup,

675
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:45,360
and Route53 and CloudFront

676
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,280
is able to decode that client
IP from that CR label itself.

677
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,530
Then CloudFront returns the best POP

678
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,300
based on that client IP.

679
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,550
Whether that's an embedded
POP if appropriate

680
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,843
or a traditional POP.

681
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,110
The client can then start
fetching content from CloudFront.

682
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,630
So in summary, embedded
POPs deliver cached content

683
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,520
directly from ISP networks,

684
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,570
improving performance

685
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,710
and overcoming

686
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,590
those potential last
mile capacity constraints

687
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,090
that you might have.

688
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,190
If you want to make use of embedded POPs,

689
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,680
I really urge you to
contact your account team

690
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,670
to help you validate...

691
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,043
Evaluate your workload
to see if it's suitable.

692
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,040
So typically, the next bottleneck
that we see is the origin.

693
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,873
Our aim really

694
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:33,180
is to offload as much traffic
as possible from the origin

695
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,140
so it has enough capacity
to serve requests at scale.

696
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,460
This is to prevent our origin

697
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,810
from becoming overwhelmed
and failing entirely.

698
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,160
Caching helps with this, of course.

699
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,602
And CloudFront uses tiered caching.

700
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:50,760
So we have edge locations,

701
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,770
we have regional edge caches,

702
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,780
but you can also use
something called Origin Shield

703
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,840
to further reduce that origin load.

704
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,083
Instead of regional edge caches
hitting the origin directly,

705
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,590
they go through Origin Shield,

706
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,290
and this provides a
better cache hit ratio,

707
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,510
reducing demand on your origin,

708
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,460
especially for those events,

709
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,210
you know, we've got a lot of scale.

710
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,190
So we've covered capacity,

711
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,870
we've covered reducing load

712
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,890
and ensuring viewers can
get a great experience.

713
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,540
It's time to really think about

714
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,400
how you design the rest of the platform

715
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,500
to provide just that, right?

716
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,647
To quote Werner Vogels,

717
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:35,310
"everything fails, all of the time."

718
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,420
Lots of customers approach us

719
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,990
by thinking about how many
nines you wanna design for.

720
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,810
But when you're thinking
about a media world,

721
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,460
this can also be very different

722
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,460
if you're designing a 24 by
seven channel for example,

723
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,023
and those event based channels.

724
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,420
And the other important part

725
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,510
is you've got the task of
really balancing the cost

726
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,960
and how much resilience
is really enough for you.

727
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,260
If your platform fails entirely,

728
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,490
users will be unable
to consume your content

729
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,150
and this might impact you in other ways

730
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,830
such as increased customer contact

731
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,453
or maybe even financially too.

732
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,240
For live events especially,

733
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,790
there's no real second
chance, we'll try again later,

734
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,740
that moment's just simply gone forever.

735
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,007
Like we discussed, things can go wrong.

736
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:24,840
So redundancy is really critical

737
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,610
to keep your stream up and running

738
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,573
so that you can deliver to your end users.

739
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:31,380
In this next example,

740
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,190
in particular we have two EC2s

741
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,920
and two availability zones
to try and help combat this.

742
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,790
We do see customers

743
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,970
deploy their own encoders
and origins in AWS,

744
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,970
but we do offer managed
services for media workflows.

745
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,560
They offload the challenges

746
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,920
of managing your own
customized infrastructure

747
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,570
and gives you capabilities and features

748
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,603
that we'll actually talk
about in a little bit.

749
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,780
These features are such as
like helping you provide

750
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,083
that best viewer experience
possible to end viewers.

751
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,480
So if you're not familiar with
AWS Elemental Media Services,

752
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,903
this is a typical workflow
for an ATT stream.

753
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,080
So we have AWS Elemental Media Connect,

754
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,550
which is our secure and reliable

755
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,413
transport service for live video.

756
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,310
That's then fed into AWS
Elemental Media Live,

757
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,470
which is our cloud-based, broadcast-grade

758
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,093
video processing service.

759
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,350
Then have AWS Elemental Media package,

760
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,000
and that is our just in time packaging

761
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,590
and origination service,

762
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,930
where you can implement
DVR-like functionality

763
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,643
and things like DRM.

764
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:38,340
And we've got Amazon CloudFront,

765
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,173
which is our CDM,

766
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,310
which we are predominantly
focusing on today.

767
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,553
And then viewers,

768
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:45,570
depending on what they wanna stream,

769
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,560
what manifests they need,

770
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,310
can pull different origin
endpoints from media package.

771
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,930
So with this,

772
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,430
we've kind of moved from ECT

773
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,220
and we've gone to AWS
Elemental Media Services.

774
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,600
So we no longer have to worry

775
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,330
about, you know, there's
underlying instances

776
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,650
and get all the benefits of
AWS Elemental Media Services.

777
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,540
For example, media live supports

778
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,002
across AZ synchronization and redundancy

779
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,863
for failover scenarios.

780
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,500
Customers running large events

781
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,123
tend to implement more redundancy
than just one regionally.

782
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,883
So we're gonna look at

783
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:22,403
what that multi-region
architecture might look like.

784
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,810
To help kind of speak this through,

785
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,497
I'm gonna look at a
typical failover scenario

786
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:31,440
that you might see,

787
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,370
but looking at where manual
intervention might be required.

788
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,740
So we have the same
architecture as what we had,

789
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,390
but obviously we've got
region one and region two

790
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,030
with Media Connect, Media
Live, and Media Package.

791
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,110
But we also have the addition

792
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,630
of Elemental Live or AWS Elemental Live,

793
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,750
which is our on-prem encoding appliance,

794
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,583
which in our case

795
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,603
is doing that venue contribution encoding.

796
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,380
So let's say something goes wrong

797
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,490
with one of the contribution
feeds going to region one

798
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,550
where the viewers are
currently streaming from.

799
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,760
Well, viewers connected to that

800
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,170
might start seeing black frames

801
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,783
instead of the actual video
content or real content.

802
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,289
But hopefully you've got a real...

803
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:14,760
An eyes on glass operations team

804
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,890
and they spot this issue early on

805
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,110
and decide that they
want to do that failover

806
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,940
to region two manually.

807
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,410
Remember, there's a time delay, right?

808
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,720
Between the issue occurring,

809
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,070
somebody spotting it,

810
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,693
and then also proactively
rectifying that situation.

811
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,910
So the failover occurs,

812
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,240
our viewers go to the URL vending service

813
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,430
and say I need a new URL,

814
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,323
and it returns one for region two.

815
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,110
However, there's a few challenges here

816
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,490
to kind of think about.

817
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,620
Number one, predominantly,
is the, you know,

818
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,770
it requires somebody
manually to do this, right?

819
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,910
And there's also a time delay

820
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,093
in detecting and then remediating it.

821
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,480
But not only that, when a viewer rejoins,

822
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,770
are they gonna have to go find

823
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,110
where they were viewing
in a stream, for example?

824
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,970
And then the timing might be misaligned

825
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,320
between the two anyway,

826
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,403
two regions anyway.

827
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,590
So how do you keep things in sync?

828
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,873
How do you do these things automatically?

829
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,880
So we're gonna explore this further,

830
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,920
but we're gonna start with time code.

831
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,210
Time code is time reference

832
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,860
that's embedded in each video frame.

833
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,000
Time code can be really important

834
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,033
in the media distribution world.

835
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,520
We want to use it for synchronization

836
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,170
in downstream components such
as the encoder and packager

837
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,050
to provide that frame accurate alignment.

838
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,060
So time code is part of the answer,

839
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,910
but how is it actually applied
to a failover scenario?

840
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,620
We have a feature that
can help manage this

841
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,350
and it's called seamless
cross region failover.

842
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,180
So we are gonna start with

843
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,580
the elemental live encoder on-prem.

844
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,710
And that's gonna use the
same time code source,

845
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,670
so both regions receive an
aligned contribution feed.

846
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,340
Media live is then
configured with Epoch locking

847
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,630
and uses the embedded timekeeper,

848
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,150
that timing source being that input lock.

849
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,327
And then CMAF ingests on the
output media package into...

850
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,340
Intermediate package, sorry.

851
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,160
And when you combine CMAF
ingest and Epoch locking,

852
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,560
it results in this regular
segmentation cadence

853
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,450
based on the Epoch time.

854
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,790
Media package can then use
stainless synchronization

855
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,553
to help predictably
package the output content.

856
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,230
So what happens if
something does go wrong,

857
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,420
such as slate input, incomplete manifesto,

858
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,650
and a missing DRM key?

859
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,150
Well, media package
actually has the ability

860
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,360
to 404 its endpoint.

861
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,120
And CloudFront is configured

862
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,530
with something called Origin Groups

863
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,470
where you specify a
primary and a secondary,

864
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,073
and also fail level criteria
based on HTTP status code.

865
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,370
When it picks up the media package

866
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,950
has indeed 404 to one
of its origin endpoints,

867
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,370
it'll automatically send that
traffic to the secondary.

868
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,295
But what if

869
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:47,010
it's not such a fundamental
problem, for example?

870
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,455
What if it's black frames,
frozen frames in the source

871
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,340
and it's only impacting one
of those contribution reads

872
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,900
going into one of the regions?

873
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,430
Well, building on the
previous architecture,

874
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,300
we have a capability

875
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,489
called Media Quality Aware
Resiliency to solve this,

876
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:00,903
or MQAR.

877
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,840
So Media Live actually has the ability

878
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,630
to also produce something
called an MQCS score

879
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,463
on each segment.

880
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:10,290
And MQCS stands for Media
Quality Confidence Score.

881
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,030
And that's based on those input parameters

882
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,278
of being black frame detection,
frozen frame detection,

883
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,830
or input source loss.

884
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,230
And that score is out of a hundred.

885
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,680
And each score is independently
based on its own input.

886
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,150
Media package actually has the ability

887
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,710
to use this in two locations.

888
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,030
It's able to use it on the input

889
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,043
to provide in-region failover,

890
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,830
and also on its output via CMSD

891
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,660
or Common Media Server Data.

892
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,340
John spoke about CMCD earlier,

893
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,823
CMSD is also part of that CTA spec.

894
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,300
And then finally,

895
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,380
continue to use origin
groups on CloudFront.

896
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,040
But instead of it being default,

897
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,150
we use Media Quality Score

898
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,880
being the origin selection
criteria, instead of the default.

899
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,713
The way it works

900
00:35:57,713 --> 00:36:00,330
is there's a getting ahead
request into both regions.

901
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,100
And it basically picks the segment

902
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,540
that's gonna ultimately provide

903
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,630
that better viewing experience
to interviewers or clients.

904
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,846
So in summary, you can leverage

905
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:12,537
AWS Media Services and
Amazon CloudFront with MQAR

906
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,970
or Media Quality Aware Resiliency.

907
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,290
So always make your eyes on glass

908
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,413
and minimize the duration
of disruption events.

909
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,920
- We haven't got long left.

910
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:28,863
- All right, thanks Jamie.

911
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,190
Can you hear me?

912
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,240
Okay, good.

913
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,073
All right.

914
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:35,850
So all these measures we've taken

915
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,890
to analyze our stream using logging

916
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,010
and to make sure our origin
and encoder are available

917
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,350
are useless if our contribution
stream into the cloud

918
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,210
is not stable.

919
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,240
So we need to make sure our
contribution stream is reliable

920
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,310
just as the rest of the
chain on the encoder,

921
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,633
the origin and CloudFront.

922
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,450
So how do we make sure our source

923
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,250
is just as reliable as our delivery?

924
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,550
Well, some of the things
that we require in our source

925
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,663
are consistency.

926
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,110
We need a reliable source.

927
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,640
We need coverage of that source

928
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,000
of wherever our event happens to be.

929
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,140
And we need it to be private

930
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,880
because usually the source
coming into the cloud

931
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,010
is our highest quality mezzanine feed.

932
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,900
So we don't want anybody
to be able to access that

933
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,520
as it's the...

934
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,470
You know, again, it's the
highest quality content

935
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,970
and we don't want that to
go into the wrong hands.

936
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,270
So we do have a solution for that

937
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,380
that a lot of customers use

938
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,430
and that is Direct Connect.

939
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,210
Direct Connect's used heavily
for stream contribution.

940
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,147
For consistency, it is a
dedicated connection into a region

941
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:37,260
offering up to a hundred
gigabits of connectivity.

942
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,410
So a lot of you all are probably
contributing content now

943
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,744
through some of the higher
quality lossless formats

944
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:46,350
like JPEG excess and
using 2022 dash seven.

945
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,700
And if you're doing things like that,

946
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,000
Direct Connect is extremely
helpful for things like that.

947
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,208
And also it is reliable.

948
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:55,392
You can have multiple
paths into the region

949
00:37:55,392 --> 00:37:56,853
using Direct Connect.

950
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,407
And coverage is in over a
hundred locations worldwide

951
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:02,850
in 30 plus countries.

952
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,430
So it's probably nearby

953
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,430
or at the facilities that
you're broadcasting from,

954
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,920
like stadiums and things
like that already.

955
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,390
And again, it is private.

956
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,650
It is a private network

957
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,120
and we are able to add things

958
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,687
like media encryption on top of it,

959
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:18,737
which we'll talk about in the next slide.

960
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,350
So this is where Jamie spoke a little bit

961
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,250
about Media Connect.

962
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,310
So this is one of the elemental
services for entry point

963
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,172
of live media into the cloud.

964
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,940
Whether you're using Direct Connect

965
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,332
or internet contribution,

966
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:35,010
you can use Media Connect
for both of those use cases.

967
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,810
So if you're using Direct Connect,

968
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,353
you're probably ingesting over a VPC.

969
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:41,970
If you're using internet connectivity,

970
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,770
you can certainly use a VPN endpoint

971
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,460
and also ingest through to Media
Connect over a VPC as well.

972
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,330
So utilizing VPC Origins and VPT Ingest,

973
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,550
the whole media workflow can be private

974
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,590
since the CloudFront
support's pulling from a VPC

975
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,543
and we can ingest to a VPC as well.

976
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,270
And we mentioned encryption earlier.

977
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,600
A lot of the protocols that
we support on Media Connect

978
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,049
offer encryption such as
SRT and Zixi and RIST.

979
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:09,900
SRT, USC, we use quite a bit.

980
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,820
And enabling encryption on that's trivial.

981
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,150
And pretty much every encoder
out there that publishes SRT

982
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,710
supports encryption.

983
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,890
So whether you're using
internet or Direct Connect,

984
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,243
encryption is an option.

985
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,380
And especially over internet contribution,

986
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,733
packet loss is a thing.

987
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,612
You know, drop packets are a thing.

988
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:31,950
Most of these protocols

989
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,210
like SRT and Zixi and RIST and RTP-FEC

990
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,120
support error correction for an ARQ,

991
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,070
automated repeat request.

992
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,127
So this is all adjustable on Media Connect

993
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:44,880
and on the encoder.

994
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,660
So if you're doing
contribution over the internet,

995
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,118
adding a little bit of latency

996
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:52,230
and in exchange for reliability

997
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,640
is available in Media Connect.

998
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,194
So you can just...

999
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:56,670
You can add a little bit
more error correction

1000
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,650
for known spotty connections.

1001
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,070
And both of these protocols,
Zixi and SRT, that I mentioned,

1002
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,590
allow for failover of the streams.

1003
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,600
So you can have multiple ISPs contributing

1004
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,950
over Media Connect.

1005
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,237
And if one of them has an
issue during the live event,

1006
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:12,737
it can automatically switch
over to the other one.

1007
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,750
And then I mentioned
earlier about metrics,

1008
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,108
they're super important.

1009
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,730
The dashboard that we
create before the event

1010
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,690
has CloudFront on there

1011
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,030
so we know if there's an
issue with CloudFront.

1012
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,580
Most likely it contains
metrics from the origin server

1013
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,930
to know how the origin's performing.

1014
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,110
And if we're using DRM or ad insertion,

1015
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,940
those metrics are also available.

1016
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,300
But we can also add ingest
metrics to the dashboard as well

1017
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,420
for ARQ recovery drop packets.

1018
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,680
So we have a quick view

1019
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,870
on whether our ingest is having issues,

1020
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,018
whether it's CloudFront or the origin.

1021
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:47,542
For SRT, which is one of
the most common protocols

1022
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:50,399
for ingest over the internet,

1023
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,830
these are the recommended metrics

1024
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,151
that we see being used for
dashboards for Media Connect.

1025
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:57,984
So these are the ones

1026
00:40:57,984 --> 00:40:59,850
that you know, for the largest live events

1027
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,330
that customers are actually
monitoring really closely

1028
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,020
for ingest quality.

1029
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,120
So next, Jes Palmer's going to come over.

1030
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,970
She's from New England Sports
Network home of the Red Sox.

1031
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,633
And she's gonna speak a
little bit about her platform.

1032
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,573
- Thank you.

1033
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,660
So NESN is not the largest RSN,

1034
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,660
but we are actually the first RSN

1035
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,660
to offer a direct to consumer
live streaming app in 2022.

1036
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:32,310
As a regional sports network,

1037
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,443
NESN has a small digital team,

1038
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,280
mostly me and my boss, (laughing)

1039
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,170
serving a growing user base.

1040
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,000
Armed with basic streaming knowledge,

1041
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,940
we were able to easily learn
and manage the stream flow

1042
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,313
through AWS Cloud Services.

1043
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,900
RSNs like NESN have unique
streaming challenges.

1044
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,300
They must deliver high
quality, low latency,

1045
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,490
live and on-demand sports content,

1046
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,560
and force regional broadcasting rights,

1047
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,920
and handle unpredictable traffic spikes,

1048
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,730
all while maintaining strong
security and compliance.

1049
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,760
Additionally, unlike many
national distributors

1050
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,810
who receive SRT feeds and
then retransmit those,

1051
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,470
at NESN, we control every
step of the broadcast.

1052
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,750
First, the game is captured by cameras,

1053
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,360
which are connected to our
mobile production unit,

1054
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,100
otherwise known as the truck.

1055
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,780
It's an actual truck

1056
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,700
with the production equipment inside it.

1057
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,570
We have 4K cameras and HD cameras

1058
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,580
at Fenway Park for the Red Sox

1059
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,310
and at TD Garden for the Bruins.

1060
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,143
For away games,

1061
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:39,870
we have our own HD cameras
that travel with the teams.

1062
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,110
The feed is then relayed over
the internet from the truck

1063
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,730
or from the opponent's stadiums

1064
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,340
to master control at our Boston office.

1065
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,090
These feeds are shared directly
with our linear distributors

1066
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,030
for fans still watching
sports the old fashioned way

1067
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,220
through their cable subscriptions.

1068
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,420
And additionally, the SRT
feed is routed directly to AWS

1069
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,213
through AWS hardware encoders.

1070
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:08,070
About 50% of the Red Sox
and Bruins seasons games

1071
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,480
are home games,

1072
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,098
which we offer in HD and 4K.

1073
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:15,120
AWS makes it easy for us

1074
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,330
to manage the availability
of our 4K stream

1075
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,450
using an AWS elemental encoder

1076
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,440
via Media Live for transcoding
and streaming management.

1077
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,790
We installed Media live

1078
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:31,680
anywhere on our AWS Elemental
encoder with John's help

1079
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,830
so that we could administer
the feed through Media live

1080
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,190
the same way we manage
our HD and UHD links

1081
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,680
in the media live dashboard.

1082
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,520
From the 4K source, we configured
a media live output group

1083
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,520
that contains 4K, 2K, 1080p,
and 720p video outputs,

1084
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,141
as well as stereo and
surround audio outputs

1085
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:56,190
and closed caption outputs.

1086
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,409
We kept the traffic...

1087
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:01,440
Sorry, we kept the audio
and video tracks separate

1088
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,480
because we found that maxing

1089
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,770
resulted in issues with
some of the OTT players.

1090
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,830
We used a media package V2 channel group

1091
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,280
to create Dash and HLS origin endpoints,

1092
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,240
again, for compatibility
on different systems.

1093
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,530
And those origins

1094
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,620
are then used for
CloudFront distributions.

1095
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,690
A major advantage to using CloudFront

1096
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,580
is that it automatically scales

1097
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,300
to accommodate traffic variations.

1098
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,760
So for example, if the Sox
are playing the Yankees,

1099
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,280
we don't have to worry
about edge capacity,

1100
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,413
CloudFront takes care of that for us.

1101
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,430
We also occasionally get third party feeds

1102
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,110
or one-off direct feeds

1103
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,470
like batting practice
directly from Fenway Park

1104
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,620
or morning skate from
Bruins Practice Arena

1105
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,440
that we offer as digital exclusives.

1106
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,330
And we have an HD link that we
use for those one-off events.

1107
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,390
We use the same basic
flow for those events.

1108
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,100
The live or third party feed

1109
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,290
is rolled out through the HD link,

1110
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,220
and the HD feed is transcoded
into lower output tiers

1111
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,060
to accommodate CTV and mobile devices.

1112
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,680
Then it's the same Media live

1113
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,933
to Media package to CloudFront Flow.

1114
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,580
Additionally, CloudFront
logs across all services

1115
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,410
provide metrics and alarms

1116
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,650
that help detect performance issues early,

1117
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,330
maintain stream quality,

1118
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,490
and ensure smooth delivery.

1119
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,870
Having these logs

1120
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,800
easily accessible and
queryable using Log Insights

1121
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,433
is essential to a lean
digital team like ours.

1122
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,320
In summary, CloudFront empowers NESN

1123
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,040
to deliver reliable high
quality streams for every fan,

1124
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,370
scale seamlessly during live sports peaks,

1125
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,120
protect media rights and
maintain regulatory compliance,

1126
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,890
and gain real time insights

1127
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,533
into audience behavior and performance.

1128
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,433
- All right.

1129
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:05,640
Thanks Jes.

1130
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,473
It's really cool.

1131
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:09,210
I always love everything
that you're doing over there.

1132
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,463
Jes spoke a little bit about MediaTailor,

1133
00:46:11,463 --> 00:46:13,920
or it was on her diagram earlier

1134
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,580
when she gave her demonstration.

1135
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,330
MediaTailor is a managed service

1136
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,740
under the Elemental umbrella

1137
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,420
that does ad replacement and
ad insertion for live streams

1138
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,043
or on-demand streams, actually.

1139
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,401
And this workflow here,
again, it uses MediaTailor,

1140
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:33,300
but a lot of the other
ad insertion platforms

1141
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,160
work in a similar manner.

1142
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,940
When you're trying to
monetize your streams,

1143
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,213
it adds a whole new set of challenges.

1144
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,100
In effect of...

1145
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,510
This is called dynamic ad insertion.

1146
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,250
And just by the name, you add
a dynamic element into it.

1147
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,010
Every single manifests for
end users are personalized

1148
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,350
because they have ads
destined for that end user.

1149
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,060
Whether you're using linear ads

1150
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,710
or whether you're using
some of the newer formats

1151
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,900
like Squeeze Back or Pause Ads.

1152
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,850
So before, we've always
talked about scaling

1153
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,860
and CloudFront scaling the origin.

1154
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,630
When we talk about ad insertion,

1155
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,520
the origin becomes that
much more important

1156
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,530
because every single
request from the end user,

1157
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,210
whether you have a thousand
or a million users,

1158
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,617
are going directly to the origin,

1159
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:16,830
and the origin's modifying
the manifest in real time.

1160
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:17,820
So it's really important

1161
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,409
that your origin can scale with
your viewers appropriately.

1162
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:25,050
When you configure a
CloudFront for advertising,

1163
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,960
you're gonna have a couple more
behaviors being configured.

1164
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,359
For your manifest, you're
no longer caching that,

1165
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,817
you're sending them directly
to the origin server,

1166
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:35,250
which is then modifying
every single manifest

1167
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,900
going to the end user.

1168
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,570
Then the MediaTailor in this case

1169
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,390
is going to make a call
to an advertiser upstream,

1170
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,340
whether it's Spring Surf, Freewill,

1171
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,650
any of those ad platforms.

1172
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,120
And those must scale as well

1173
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,260
because every single request

1174
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,543
is gonna be a unique
request to an ad server.

1175
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,229
So it's really important

1176
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:56,489
when we add dynamic ad
insertion into a platform

1177
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:59,250
that we look into that as an origin.

1178
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,560
As well as DRM platforms as well,

1179
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,471
you know, they're typically
not behind CloudFront.

1180
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:06,981
MediaTailor's actually
recently added some features

1181
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:09,870
to help with the ad platform,

1182
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,049
'cause if everybody's going to
an ad break at the same time

1183
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:13,652
and we're hitting a million viewers

1184
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:15,900
to an ad platform all at once,

1185
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,260
the ad platform, whoever it
might be, can't handle that.

1186
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,980
So MediaTailor actually has the ability

1187
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,340
to pre-fetch ads before an ad break

1188
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,740
and stack a request to an ad server.

1189
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,600
So these are some of the
really important considerations

1190
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,910
when you're adding monetization
to your live stream.

1191
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,880
Again, whether it's linear ad replacement,

1192
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,150
overlay, squeeze back,
any of the newer formats,

1193
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,800
there's a lot more considerations

1194
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,290
that you have to look over,

1195
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,910
specifically with the origin server,

1196
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,643
the origin server being
the ad insertion provider.

1197
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:52,770
So I wanna hand it back over
to Jamie for the summary.

1198
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,840
And yeah-
- Cheers.

1199
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,890
Thank you.
- Cheers.

1200
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,870
- So to wrap things up,

1201
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,764
we wanted to aim this talk
about, you know, thinking of ways

1202
00:49:04,764 --> 00:49:05,597
that you can...

1203
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:07,410
Or to help you deliver those events

1204
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,050
successfully and at scale.

1205
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,090
We want you to remember these key things

1206
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,303
when you start planning for
your next large scale event.

1207
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,590
So firstly, observability
is critical, right?

1208
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,754
Whether that's dashboards,
data collection,

1209
00:49:21,754 --> 00:49:24,630
and through real time logs and Kinesis,

1210
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,880
but think about how you
could use other data points

1211
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,403
such as CMCD and CMSD

1212
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:30,573
to also help you with your observability.

1213
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,680
Architecture actually...

1214
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,513
Oh, sorry.

1215
00:49:35,513 --> 00:49:36,346
Architecture design

1216
00:49:36,346 --> 00:49:37,650
can actually also go beyond

1217
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,590
just the encode and
the origination, right?

1218
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,110
We covered AWS Elemental Media Services,

1219
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,186
but also remember

1220
00:49:44,186 --> 00:49:46,689
like how to leverage other infrastructure

1221
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:49,470
to help you absorb some of that traffic,

1222
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,933
such as Embedded POPs and Origin Shield.

1223
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,680
Security is also a
really layered approach.

1224
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,670
There's not really one
mechanism that fits all.

1225
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,460
So think about your
end-to-end security strategy

1226
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,460
covering, you know, tokenization,
IP blocking, GA blocking,

1227
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,703
and using mechanisms like
CloudFront functions and AWS WAF.

1228
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,600
And then finally, monetization

1229
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,180
can be just more than a
subscription payment, right?

1230
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,850
You can use server side ad insertion

1231
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,250
to help you monetize your content

1232
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,743
using services such as MediaTailor.

1233
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,000
So if you want to learn about

1234
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,670
or continue reading on
some of these topics

1235
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,353
that we discussed today,

1236
00:50:37,353 --> 00:50:38,760
or want to deploy the samples,

1237
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,110
here are the links to them.

1238
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:43,248
(silence)

1239

And finally, if you're interested

1240
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,840
in leveling up your skills on
network and content delivery,

1241
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,143
I thoroughly recommend you
check out Skill Builder.

1242
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,410

Thanks for joining us.

1244
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,597
Hope you found it useful

1245
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,170
to kind of think about, you know,

1246
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,490
the next things you need to look out

1247
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,320
for those large scale events.

1248
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,760
