1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,240
- Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,670
Thank you for joining me

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,670
as I talk to you about
seamless network-based

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,630
fraud protection in FinTech
and digital business.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,950
I'm Oscar Rodriguez,

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,640
Senior Director, Global
Partner Solutions at Vonage,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,420
and today, we're gonna look
at how the mobile network

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,010
can help stop fraud before it
ever reaches your business.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,930
Now, FinTech and digital platforms

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,980
are under constant pressure
to balance security

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,390
with user experience,

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,200
and attackers are getting faster, cheaper,

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,180
and more automated.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,260
Now, I'll walk you through how
network-based intelligence,

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,470
Silent Authentication,
and branded communication,

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,110
can create a seamless layer of protection

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,500
that improves trust,
strengthens conversions,

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,970
and lowers cost.

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,413
So let's jump in.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,130
First of all, let me take
a moment to ground us

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,130
into who Vonage is today
as part of Ericsson.

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,490
So we are an end-to-end
communications provider

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,570
that serves more than
100,000 enterprise customers

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,720
across more than a hundred countries.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,230
Our platform supports

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,270
over 1.7 million registered developers

27
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,740
and is powered by a global
team of over 2,500 employees,

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,103
including over 900 in
product and technology.

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,910
On the left side, you
can see the full suite

30
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,980
that makes this possible.

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,960
We combined unified communications,

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,120
contact center capabilities,

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,810
and our full range of communication APIs

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,610
covering voice, video,
messaging, and social channels.

35
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,220
Then on the the right half of the wheel,

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,480
you'll see the next generation
of network-powered solutions.

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,230
This includes mobile
identity tools like Verify

38
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,593
with Silent Authentication
and Identity Insights,

39
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,170
Fraud Defender services,

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,970
and new capabilities for
location, network insights,

41
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,400
and connectivity experience.

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,640
Together, this creates
a complete ecosystem

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,970
that lets businesses engage, authenticate,

44
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,810
and protect their customers
using both traditional channels

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,183
and intelligence from the mobile network.

46
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,580
It is the foundation that enables

47
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,890
everything we are talking about today,

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,290
especially the next
wave of fraud prevention

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,213
powered by network APIs.

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,690
So one of the problems
that we're seeing now

51
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,690
is that fraud is no longer
a manual one-off effort.

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,133
It has become productized.

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,930
Entire attack chains are
packaged as easy to use services

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,330
that anyone can buy.

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,120
Criminals no longer need technical skills.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
They can subscribe to a
$5 voice cloning SaaS,

57
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,680
spin up a drag and drop phishing kit

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,320
with built-in support, by the way,

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,100
or even purchase SIM swap as a service.

60
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,720
Now these tools make it simple

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,110
to launch attacks at a massive scale.

62
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,830
And the cost to run these
attacks has collapsed as well.

63
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,670
What used to take time,
skill, and resources,

64
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,883
can now be executed for just cents.

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,810
AI and automation are
doing the heavy lifting,

66
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,673
which means more attacks launch
faster and by more people.

67
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,780
Now the barrier to entry
has never been lower.

68
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,840
What once required a sophisticated hacker,

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,113
can now be done by a script
kitty with a credit card.

70
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,890
This is why defenses need to evolve.

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,990
Fraud has become industrial,

72
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,010
and our protection strategy has
to match that level of scale

73
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,453
and automation.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,740
Now you should know that fraud

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,500
is exploding across every channel.

76
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,003
The average data breach
now costs $4.4 million,

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,020
and nearly one in four US adults

78
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,870
have experienced some
type of account takeover

79
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,540
or fraud just last year.

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,560
Anybody in the audience

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,160
experienced any type of
account fraud or takeover?

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,010
No? Maybe you know somebody that has?

83
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,740
There you go.

84
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,660
So, you're not alone.

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,530
Even the most secure of
organizations get hit.

86
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,560
In fact, in January 2024,

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,640
the SEC's official Twitter
account was hacked.

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,810
A single fake post about
Bitcoin ETF approval

89
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,950
sent market surging before
the breach was confirmed.

90
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,170
So what does that tell us?

91
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,413
If the SEC can be compromised, anyone can.

92
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,790
Now, the SEC hack wasn't
a technical exploit.

93
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,680
It was done through social engineering.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,863
And this is the same pattern
we see across industries.

95
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,910
That's where fraudsters
pretend to be customers

96
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,890
or employees.

97
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,460
They use SIM swaps to take over numbers,

98
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,930
phish for credentials,

99
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,140
and spam users with multifactor prompts

100
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,840
until somebody finally gives in.

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,930
All of these start with one weak link.

102
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,873
Anybody guess what that weak link is?

103
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,320
(audience faintly speaking)

104
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,181
What's that?

105
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:28,230
(audience faintly speaking)

106
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,313
You're getting close.

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,793
What's that?

108
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,013
It's the phone number.

109
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,050
Everybody has a mobile device

110
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,060
that has a phone number attached to it,

111
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,550
even a wearable, that has a
phone number attached to it.

112
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,253
We rely on it for many things.

113
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,690
So, let's imagine in a
contact center scenario,

114
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,430
an agent gets a call,

115
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,770
the phone number
presented in the caller ID

116
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,100
matches that of a customer record.

117
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,350
The name provided by the caller

118
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,663
also matches that customer record.

119
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,780
But in reality,

120
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,990
the caller is a hacker or fraudster

121
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,273
that took over that SIM an hour ago.

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Now, without trust signals,
which Vonage can provide,

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,860
the agent might help reset the account

124
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,860
or approve a large transfer
in a banking scenario

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,653
which could drain somebody's life savings,

126
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,870
ruining lives, and of
course, brand reputation.

127
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,850
Now every incident like this
erodes trust and brand loyalty.

128
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,850
And since 70% of breaches
start with social engineering,

129
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,383
prevention must happen in real-time.

130
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,950
Now on this slide, we're
introducing the idea

131
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,670
that next generation fraud
protection is now possible

132
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,470
because it taps directly
into the mobile network.

133
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,510
This gives businesses a way to stop fraud

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,970
before it ever reaches their systems,

135
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,790
and it does this without slowing down

136
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,763
or inconveniencing legitimate users.

137
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,150
The mobile network quietly verifies

138
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,970
who is on the other end of a phone number.

139
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,300
It confirms that the device is real,

140
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,820
that the subscriber is authentic,

141
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,853
and that nothing suspicious is
happening behind the scenes.

142
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,380
So during an account creation, login,

143
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,850
or high value actions,
like large transfers,

144
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,660
real customers move
through with no extra steps

145
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,870
because the checks are happening invisibly

146
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,923
in the background.

147
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,430
Now this same intelligence can block

148
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,043
a wide range of threats in real-time.

149
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,850
Fake accounts, account takeovers,

150
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,120
refund abuse, social engineering attempts,

151
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,860
phishing, and smishing,

152
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,450
even traffic pumping,

153
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,250
all become detectable

154
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,370
because the network can see signals

155
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,850
that apps and browsers
alone simply cannot.

156
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,520
If something looks off, it is flagged,

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,840
and before it even becomes a fraud

158
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,640
and if everything checks out,

159
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,703
well, the user continues
without any friction.

160
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,820
Now this creates a protection layer

161
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,210
that sits under your
business and your customers.

162
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,530
It is always on

163
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,363
and it'll always verifying.

164
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
Customers never notice it,

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,680
but it is constantly shielding them

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,230
from account and communications fraud.

167
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,620
It reinforces the entire
fraud prevention stack

168
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,033
while keeping every trusted
interaction smooth and seamless.

169
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,440
Now, when you look at the
full customer journey,

170
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,940
fraud is not isolated to just one stage.

171
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,010
It can show up anywhere.

172
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,820
From the moment the user first signs up,

173
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,590
to the interactions they have
months or even years later.

174
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,770
What is powerful about the
mobile network intelligence

175
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,830
is that it gives you
protection at every point

176
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,443
without changing the customer experience.

177
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,070
At the very beginning,
during account creation,

178
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,750
the mobile network can confirm

179
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,750
that the person actually
possesses the phone number

180
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,863
that they are using.

181
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,160
This happens instantly and invisibly

182
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,770
using silent authentication.

183
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,620
And it helps prevent fake or
automated account creation

184
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,493
without forcing the user through
extra verification steps.

185
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,270
Now, when the user logs in

186
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,120
or performs any sensitive action,

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,430
the network can silently verify

188
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,800
that the device and subscriber

189
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,990
match what you would expect.

190
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,030
If someone has hijacked an account

191
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,370
or is trying to break in,

192
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,330
well then, the access can
be blocked right away.

193
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,790
Now, during account recovery,

194
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,380
which is one of the biggest
points of vulnerability,

195
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,290
the network can detect SIM swap activity.

196
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,290
And since SIM swaps are often
used as a precursor to fraud,

197
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,130
catching that signal early,

198
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,580
protects both the user and the business

199
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,013
during the reset process.

200
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,580
Now, even in day-to-day interactions

201
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,630
like customer service
calls or outbound outreach,

202
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,210
the network adds trust.

203
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,860
Branded calls and messages

204
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,570
ensure that the customer knows

205
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,760
the communication is legitimate,

206
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,020
which helps eliminate spoofing
and impersonation attempts.

207
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,380
So across onboarding, authentication,

208
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,840
recovery, and engagement,

209
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,270
the mobile network acts as a continuous

210
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,280
and invisible shield.

211
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,230
It strengthens security at every step

212
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,390
while keeping the experience simple

213
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,433
and smooth for real customers.

214
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,880
The Vonage Protection Suite

215
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,930
is our umbrella set of a
capabilities for mobile identity

216
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,790
and fraud prevention,

217
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,960
all powered by the intelligence
of the mobile network.

218
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,080
Now the first piece is our Verify API

219
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,060
with Silent Authentication.

220
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,560
This is our network-powered

221
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,540
two-factor authentication solution.

222
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,300
It confirms possession of the phone number

223
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,520
directly with the mobile network,

224
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,640
which makes it harder to spoof

225
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,233
and far more reliable than
traditional SMS-based OTPs.

226
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,930
Next is our Identity
Insights API with SIM swap.

227
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,390
This brings network level intelligence

228
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,880
into your fraud and risk models.

229
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,470
It gives you real-time signals

230
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,710
about the status of the
device and subscriber,

231
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,010
helping you strengthen decisions
around onboarding, login,

232
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,110
and high-value actions.

233
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,550
Remember our earlier example

234
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,233
where the agent could have
approved a large transfer?

235
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,160
If he had known that the SIM was swapped,

236
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,410
he would've blocked that.

237
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,810
Then we have branded communication.

238
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,890
This allows businesses

239
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,360
to send trusted branded messages and calls

240
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,220
that are hard to spoof.

241
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,510
It helps customers know

242
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,800
that the message or
call they are receiving

243
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,520
is truly coming from you, the brand,

244
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,120
which reduces scams and
social engineering attempts.

245
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,760
Now together, these solutions form

246
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,630
a comprehensive protection layer
that helps secure accounts,

247
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,150
reduce fraud, and build trust

248
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,193
across every customer interaction.

249
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,903
So I'm gonna go ahead and
switch over to a quick demo.

250
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,440
So let me walk you
through this short demo.

251
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,030
So notice the...

252
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,340
For this particular request,

253
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,980
we're using our Identity Insights API.

254
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,490
Now, the payload in this case includes

255
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,490
insights for format, SIM
swap, subscriber match...

256
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,460
I'm sorry, SIM swap and
current and original carrier,

257
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,530
all of which are now generally available

258
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,650
for all US major carriers through Vonage.

259
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,140
Location verification, subscriber match,

260
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,850
roaming, and reachability insights

261
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,550
are planned in future releases.

262
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,170
So as you can see,

263
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,230
current carrier gives us the type of line.

264
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,000
In this case, it's a mobile line.

265
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,640
We're using this UK number
being a mobile line.

266
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,650
So it means that we can
get additional insights

267
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,440
on that phone number from the network.

268
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,050
Next is format.

269
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,880
The Format Insight tells us

270
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,680
the country the number belongs to

271
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,570
including the country code
and regional time zones,

272
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,710
and of course, country-specific
formatting as well.

273
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,690
As an example, in North America,

274
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,153
we use parentheses around the area code.

275
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,813
Next, we have original carrier.

276
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,510
Original carrier, it differs
from the current carrier.

277
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,363
From that, you can derive
that the number was ported.

278
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,330
And if it was ported and you combine that

279
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,980
with a SIM swap signal,

280
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,410
well, that can be some type of clue

281
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,910
that there might be some
type of account takeover.

282
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,180
SIM swap not only tells
us if the SIM was swapped,

283
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,790
but it will also give us a timestamp

284
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,400
of when it was swapped last.

285
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,320
And you can actually include
a parameter in the request

286
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,460
indicating a period that you wanna check.

287
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,430
So if you wanted to check the last hour

288
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,630
up to the last 100 days to
see if a SIM was swapped

289
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,043
within that period of time.

290
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,133
For subscriber match,

291
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,310
you basically provide us any
information that you have

292
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,640
on this particular user and phone number.

293
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,460
So if you have their name, for example,

294
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,070
a date of birth, and even an address,

295
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,360
we'll go ahead and check that

296
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,060
with the mobile network records,

297
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,240
and we'll provide you
with a match on that.

298
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,230
In this case, you could see

299
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,203
that the first name, last name match,

300
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,430
and then looks like
we've moved on past that.

301
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,660
Sorry about...

302
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,580
So, you might've noticed

303
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,860
that the first name and
last name matched exactly.

304
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,890
The date of birth, there
was a partial match.

305
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,330
For location verification,

306
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,590
this allows us to check

307
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,410
if the device associated
with the phone number

308
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,950
is within a certain radius of location,

309
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,410
such as where a transaction
or a login attempt

310
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,360
is expected to take place.

311
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,760
And then roaming will
return true or false,

312
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,550
just depending if the user is roaming,

313
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,720
and also return where the user
is running, which country.

314
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,950
And then reachability

315
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,160
will determine if the device
is connected to the network

316
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,523
through SMS or a data channel.

317
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,350
All right, so that was a very simple demo

318
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,840
of our Identity Insights API.

319
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,740
Very simple.

320
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,630
It's a quick API that takes
milliseconds to execute,

321
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,480
but really, it could save,

322
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,073
would I say $4.4 million,
the average data breach cost,

323
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,553
for an API call that cost just cents.

324
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,310
All right, so let me finish
with a real-world example

325
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,310
of silent authentication at scale.

326
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,630
So Lydia,

327
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,140
is one of Europe's
fastest growing neobanks,

328
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,440
serving more than 8 million users.

329
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,600
They were looking for a
way to strengthen security

330
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,790
without slowing anyone down.

331
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,900
So they moved to Vonage Verify
and Silent Authentication.

332
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,210
Now the impact was immediate.

333
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,050
Authentication times dropped by 50%,

334
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,980
giving users a faster and
smoother login experience.

335
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,640
Now, when Silent Authentication is used,

336
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,480
they also eliminated

337
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,880
SMS-based social
engineering attacks entirely

338
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,180
because Silent Auth removes
the need for one-time codes

339
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,913
that can be intercepted or phished.

340
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,220
And on top of that,

341
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,400
they were able to lower
their total cost of ownership

342
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,140
compared to their previous solution,

343
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,500
since Silent Auth reduces reliance on SMS

344
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,363
while improving conversion rates.

345
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,550
This is a great example

346
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,510
of how network-powered
authentication can protect users,

347
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,040
improve performance,

348
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,073
and optimize cost all at the same time.

349
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,550
That has been my presentation.

350
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,170
Thank you for your time.

351
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,020
If you wanna book a meeting
with me, scan the QR code,

352
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,640
connect with me on LinkedIn,

353
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,600
or reach me out on the show floor.

354
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,100
Thank you very much, everyone.
