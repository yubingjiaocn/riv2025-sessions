  "abstract": "Online fraud is no longer isolated — it’s industrialized, scalable, and relentless. From synthetic identities and account takeovers to payment scams and traffic pumping, today’s attacks are powered by crime-as-a-service tools that evolve faster than traditional defenses. FinTechs and Digital Businesses are under pressure to meet strict compliance requirements while delivering seamless, user-friendly experiences — yet every additional security check risks customer churn. The cost of failure is staggering: direct losses, missed revenue, and significant erosion of brand trust. This talk explores how mobile network intelligence adds an invisible, real-time layer of fraud protection, building brand trust while improving customer experiences This presentation is brought to you by Vonage, Part of Ericsson, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "在线欺诈不再是孤立的——它已经工业化、规模化且无情。从合成身份和账户接管到支付诈骗和流量欺诈，当今的攻击由犯罪即服务工具驱动，其演变速度超过了传统防御手段。金融科技公司和数字化企业面临着满足严格合规要求的压力，同时还要提供无缝、用户友好的体验——然而每增加一项安全检查都可能导致客户流失。失败的代价是惊人的：直接损失、收入损失以及品牌信任的严重侵蚀。本次演讲探讨移动网络智能如何添加一个不可见的实时欺诈保护层，在改善客户体验的同时建立品牌信任。本演示由 AWS 合作伙伴 Vonage（爱立信旗下）为您呈现。",
