1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,460
- [Brian] Cool, welcome to re:Invent.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,310
We're bright and early or
early enough on a Monday.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,130
So very glad that you all
showed up here with us

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,100
on this Monday morning, so thank you.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,090
- [Sean] Yeah, so I'm Sean Kendall.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,970
I am principal solution architect at AWS.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,430
I specialize in serverless
and generative AI.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,400
Been with AWS for just over six years,

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,563
working out of Calgary, Alberta in Canada.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,520
And I guess, Brian,
wanna introduce yourself?

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,130
- [Brian] Yeah, so my
name's Brian Zambrano.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,390
I've also been around for a bit.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,200
It's gonna be about
almost seven years at AWS.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,330
So I was a solutions architect like Sean

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,820
for many years, developer background.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,920
And I currently work in a group

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,290
called the Generative
AI Innovation Center.

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,850
Has anyone heard about us?

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,290
Gen AI Innovation Center?

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,123
No one?

21
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:47,956
Oh my, okay.

22
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:49,790
You need to, because what we do right now

23
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,100
is we are building generative AI,

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,740
call 'em proof of concepts,
more like MVPs, frankly,

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,510
for customers for free.

26
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,360
So if you have AWS account
team and have some idea

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,180
of how gen AI could help
you and your organization,

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,070
you should definitely
talk to your account team

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,903
because that's what we do.

30
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:07,710
Again, it's a pretty awesome deal

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,950
for all you in the
audience, the customers.

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,110
But yeah, so I'm building
gen AI solutions right now

33
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,270
in Innovation Center.

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,103
- [Sean] Awesome, thanks.

35
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,600
Alright, so today, we're
gonna be talking about

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,820
accelerating building your
serverless applications

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,943
with Kiro and MCP servers.

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,773
Now, show of hands here, who
has heard of Kiro in the room?

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Quite a few people.

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,590
Okay, no, that's pretty good.

41
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,763
Who has used Kiro?

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,823
Okay, less hands.

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,670
So yeah, we're gonna be
focusing on that technology.

44
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,880
Kiro is just our agentic
AI that enables you

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,563
to build a lot faster.

46
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,140
And then of course, we
are gonna be focusing

47
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,550
on serverless here today.

48
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,500
Another show of hands,
who's building serverless

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,900
apps here in the room today?

50
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,700
Cool, a a lot of show of hands.

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,170
So that's good, 'cause
we're not gonna be focusing

52
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,000
too much on the serverless side.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,590
We are gonna be building serverless apps

54
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,750
and showing you how to build
those a little bit better

55
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,823
using Kiro and faster using Kiro.

56
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,460
But yeah, we're not gonna
be focusing too much

57
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,563
on those serverless patterns and whatnot.

58
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,020
Now, what you're gonna
get out of here today

59
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,440
is we're gonna go over a
developer tool overview first,

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,350
and then a target architecture
on a TicTacToe game.

61
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,410
That's what we're gonna be
building here in this code talk.

62
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,770
We've already built the front
end of the TicTacToe game,

63
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,870
because we figured we don't
want Kiro to sit there

64
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,260
building too much stuff within
this short period of time.

65
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,580
So we've built that, we've deployed it,

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,373
there's an open API spec
that's available on the UI,

67
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,280
just so that, you know, to
kind of help the backend

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,260
and Kiro figure out how to build it

69
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,123
a little bit better faster.

70
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,210
I'm gonna show you some
prompt engineering.

71
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,490
So what's the prompt that I'm gonna use

72
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,070
to actually build the backend?

73
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,720
So that prompt's gonna be provided to Kiro

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,543
so it can go ahead and do
all the things with AI.

75
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,700
And then after I show you that,

76
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,990
then we're gonna get into the coding.

77
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,690
So you're gonna see myself, I'm
gonna be using the Kiro CLI,

78
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,940
which I'll tell you more
about here in a bit.

79
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,000
And within that Kiro CLI,
you'll see how I can build

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,280
that backend and then
I'll hand it over to Brian

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,950
who's gonna use the IDE version of Kiro.

82
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,413
And so you can kinda see
both flavors of Kiro.

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,250
So for the developer tool overview,

84
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,290
the first thing we're
gonna be using here today

85
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,210
is Amazon Kiro.

86
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,630
And within Amazon Kiro, we
have the Amazon Kiro CLI.

87
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,450
So now this is my preference,
what I'm building.

88
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,790
There's no real right or wrong here,

89
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,490
but the Kiro CLI allows
me to open up a terminal

90
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,613
and type in my prompt.

91
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:33,060
I can actually just chat,
if I really want to,

92
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,370
but it allows me to be
a extremely hands off.

93
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,940
I gave it a prompt, I hit
Enter, and I just let it go.

94
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,110
And it doesn't have to bother me at all.

95
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,880
I don't have to use a UI.

96
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,173
That's what I prefer.

97
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,350
But then the other way of
doing it is the Kiro IDE.

98
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,930
So if you prefer a nice IDE experience,

99
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,730
then this is another option for you.

100
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,110
We're also gonna be
talking about MCP servers.

101
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,073
Another show of hands,
who here has heard of MCP?

102
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,130
Most of the group, that's really good.

103
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,693
Who's using MCP today?

104
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,910
- [Brian] Wow, okay.

105
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,453
Who could explain what an MCP
server is to their friends?

106
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,240
Ooh, I got you on that one.

107
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,290
Okay, we got one.

108
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,850
Okay, that's great, that's great.

109
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,960
So we're gonna get into that.

110
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,793
- [Sean] Yeah.

111
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,920
- [Audience Member] I was just
gonna say like they're five.

112
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,030
- What's that?
- Like they're five.

113
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,453
- Like they're five, exactly.
- Like they're five.

114
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,360
- [Sean] That's good. (laughs)

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,740
And I'm gonna be showing you

116
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,760
some of the serverless MCP servers

117
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,680
that we have within AWS Labs today.

118
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,000
So after this session,

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,530
if you wanna go use these on your own,

120
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,500
there's a full library of MCP servers.

121
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,040
Basically, tools you can use
to help with your development.

122
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,470
So the first thing we're
gonna focus on here

123
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,460
is the Amazon Kiro CLI.

124
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,410
So what you're seeing up
on the screen right now,

125
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,870
that's basically what it looks
like if you're using the CLI,

126
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,130
you'll type in kiro-cli,
and this is how it opens.

127
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,930
So you get this nice little graphic.

128
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,860
Within here, you can basically
just start typing prompts,

129
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,383
and it'll respond within the terminal.

130
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,280
The other way of using it is the Kiro IDE

131
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,480
and also hands over to Brian here

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,610
so we can kind of talk
through how this one works.

133
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,510
- [Brian] Yeah, and
before I get into this,

134
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,490
just a couple things we forgot to mention.

135
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,230
One, this should be interactive.

136
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,870
So as we're coding, as
we're talking about this,

137
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,910
feel free to raise your
hand, shout out a question,

138
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,190
and we will do our best to answer it.

139
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,690
So we have our first one, yes.

140
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,737
- [Audience Member] So here's
something that (indistinct),

141
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,994
because when I reserved this session,

142
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:36,343
it was called Building
Serverless App with Amazon Q.

143
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,362
- Yes.
- And MCP server.

144
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:43,290
So Kiro has replaced
Amazon Q in this session.

145
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,561
Is the same going to
happen to the service?

146
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,100
- [Brian] So that was my second point.

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,050
So that was step one is ask me questions.

148
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,140
Two is you segued perfectly into it.

149
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,750
Who here has heard about Amazon Q?

150
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,340
Most people, okay.

151
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,320
So Q as a brand is moving to Kiro now.

152
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,030
So what Sean's gonna be talking about,

153
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,950
what I'm gonna be talking about,

154
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,420
the CLI went from Q CLI to Kiro CLI.

155
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,340
They're basically from
a functional standpoint.

156
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,453
It's the same thing.

157
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,300
Anything else to add on that one?

158
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,550
- [Sean] Well, actually, so
there's a progression here.

159
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,803
So has anyone here used Code Whisperer?

160
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,490
Okay, a few less people, all right.

161
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,890
So it actually started as Code Whisperer,

162
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,140
which was like the agentic AI

163
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,290
that then turned into Amazon Q developer.

164
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,910
And now that has turned into Kiro.

165
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,910
So we just keep renaming
things, that's all it is.

166
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,130
Whereas you were using Q yesterday

167
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,100
on the CLI, for example,
you would type Q at Enter,

168
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,540
which I loved by the way.

169
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,050
Now you type Kiro CLI, which
is a little more annoying,

170
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,640
but it is there.

171
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,110
You have a follow up question?

172
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,670
- [Audience Member]
Yeah, I have a follow up.

173
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,670
Since this session is
gonna have a Kiro IDE part,

174
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,360
so does all the features and practices

175
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,960
that you are gonna show
on Kiro IDE applicable

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,090
to the Amazon Q?

177
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,820
For instance, extension of visual code?

178
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,700
- [Brian] Those are different things.

179
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,950
So you're asking about the VS code plugin?

180
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,783
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

181
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,310
So they're gonna be di
they're gonna be different.

182
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,390
I'll try, as we get into this,

183
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,300
I think it should become
obvious or more obvious,

184
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,363
and I'll try to talk
through it a little bit.

185
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:28,680
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

186
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,989
- [Audience Member] So I
have a question regarding

187
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:34,910
how you pay for it,
'cause Kiro, sometime ago,

188
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:39,530
it had from regular payment option,

189
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,390
it was separate subscription,

190
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,190
and now that Q has been part of the Q CLI,

191
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,630
I wonder whether the same.

192
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,380
- [Brian] So I think,
yeah, let's hold that

193
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,280
for after the talk.

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,200
So we wanna get into the
technical parts of this,

195
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,910
and then for any
questions, we'll be outside

196
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,510
and we can do our best to
answer things like that.

197
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,710
But let me just go
through this real quick.

198
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,760
So Sean talked about Kiro
CLI, so this is the IDE.

199
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,460
So this is like, you know,

200
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,160
if you've used things like cursor,

201
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,320
it's a fork of VS code.

202
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,750
And so it's gonna look very
similar if you're using VS code.

203
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,580
So a couple things here to call out.

204
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,940
On the left, there's a
little ghost, the Kiro icon.

205
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,820
And when you click on that,
other things start showing up.

206
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,980
So the top, there's
something called specs.

207
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,690
I'm not gonna talk about that today

208
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,190
unless we have extra time.

209
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,740
But if you've heard about
spectrum development,

210
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,690
that is something that
is from my knowledge

211
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,310
is unique to Kiro.

212
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,330
It's pretty interesting.

213
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,020
And then there are the section
called agent steering docs.

214
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,430
I will talk about that.

215
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,960
And then finally, the MCP server

216
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,090
configuration down there at the bottom.

217
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,580
And on the right is where
you have your interface

218
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,940
to talk with your agent,
your coding assistant.

219
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,150
And again, this is unique to Kiro,

220
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,340
at least as far as aware.

221
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,140
You can do a what's called a vibe session,

222
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,670
which is just what you're used to.

223
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,000
Chat with your agent and
tell it to do something.

224
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,960
And then on the right,
there's spec-driven chat,

225
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,470
which is a little bit different,
which we won't get into.

226
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,550
So let's just get in at,

227
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,660
this is a very high level
about what is an MCP server.

228
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,020
So what it stands for -
Model Context Protocol.

229
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,050
And so if you think
about you as developers,

230
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,480
you're gonna go and interact with an agent

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
to go and do something, right?

232
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,340
Like build me a React UI,
go and update my serverless

233
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,840
application to do this, whatever.

234
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,090
So you're interacting with some agent,

235
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,390
and the agent has, there's
a model behind the scenes,

236
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,100
it's gonna have some internal knowledge

237
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,503
based on whenever it was trained, right?

238
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,290
New things pop up.

239
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,190
There are other pieces of data
that could be really useful

240
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,920
for your agent to know about,
which it doesn't know about.

241
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,390
Or you might want to enable it

242
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,460
to actually perform
actions on your behalf.

243
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,510
And so you do that by
integrating with other systems.

244
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,250
So here, as an example,
you could be integrating

245
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,320
with a third party API,

246
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,233
or your own company's internal API, right?

247
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,810
We were talking this morning,

248
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,770
Sean's customer was building a POC

249
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,350
to actually have an agent place an order

250
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,990
for their customer, for their customer,

251
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,190
his customer's customers.

252
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,430
And so there are all these
things and information

253
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,330
and features that you
would like your agent

254
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,300
to be aware of and
actually have access to.

255
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,380
And so how do you do that?

256
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,350
And the answer for that
is now these MCP servers.

257
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,240
And so think about MCP
servers as a common interface

258
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,870
to backend systems to
either get new knowledge

259
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,695
to perform actions, but
it's a standard interface.

260
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,823
It's a protocol.

261
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,510
And so you could literally
build an MCP server

262
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,880
like as shown on the screen
to do these things, right?

263
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,660
Interact with my third party
API, go and figure out,

264
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,020
go and read the business logic
of my internal application,

265
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,820
or reach into a database

266
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,890
and go read information
or write information.

267
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,690
So you could do that.

268
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,520
But I think what we're
seeing over and over now

269
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,600
is that there are
purpose built MTP servers

270
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,540
that have specific
duties that do one thing

271
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,530
or a set of things that are
all wrapped around a given job.

272
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,883
So for example, there might
be a database MTP server

273
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:23,280
that is going to be running
database queries for you,

274
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,590
and you can see on and on how this goes.

275
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,380
But the overall idea here is, you know,

276
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,740
as you leave, think
about this as MCP servers

277
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,933
are a way to, actually, next slide.

278
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,770
So MCP servers and connections

279
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,560
are a way to give the models access

280
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,870
to new up-to-date information.

281
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,670
And it's something that information

282
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,743
that they don't know about inherently.

283
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,293
So that's the big thing there.

284
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,730
Okay, you wanna take this one, Sean?

285
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,200
- Sure.
- Some examples?

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,840
- [Sean] Yeah, so some
examples of MCP servers

287
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,013
that you might see.

288
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,470
And one that we're gonna
be using here today

289
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,330
within the actual coding session

290
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,640
is up-to-date AWS documentation.

291
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,290
So of course, the models you're using

292
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,670
when you are vibe coding

293
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,800
and you're building these
solutions through AI,

294
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,860
they understand AWS, they
understand the documentation,

295
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,250
but only up to a specific date
of when that training ended.

296
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,640
So now, adding in the AWS
documentation MCP server,

297
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,330
it's gonna be able to reference
the latest documentation.

298
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,740
For example, all the new features

299
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,390
that are coming out this week.

300
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,760
You'll be able to build
those as they get released

301
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,040
and as they get published
out onto the documentation.

302
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,500
So that's one of the good use
cases for these MCP servers,

303
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,860
and a good example of what we use today.

304
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,750
Now, if you're developing production apps

305
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,360
that are now gonna connect
through MCP servers,

306
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,150
up-to-date stock prices would
be another good example.

307
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,980
Weather data, anything to do

308
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,020
with any API integrations, right?

309
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,270
So now, you can just have an MCP server

310
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,090
execute those integrations
for you through AI,

311
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,170
and then basically any of
your company's internal API

312
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,380
or internal documentation as well.

313
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,480
So really, any types of data lookup

314
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,250
that you need in real time without using

315
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,150
the models training data is a
really good way to see that.

316
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,350
Now, today within the coding session,

317
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,390
here's some of the MCP
servers we're gonna be using.

318
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,780
So the first one is the
AWS serverless MCP server.

319
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,930
This MCP server deals with SAM integration

320
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,400
so it understands SAM

321
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,980
and understands all the
commands of how to use SAM.

322
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,990
And it'll actually execute those for you

323
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,330
within your own environment.

324
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,470
It can do local testing,

325
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,760
and it gives you serverless guidance.

326
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,430
So for any serverless app,
this is a really good one

327
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,683
to add into your coding agent.

328
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,640
Then we have the AWS CDK MCP server,

329
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,130
which is a personal preference of mine,

330
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,580
and that's because I like to
build everything within CDK.

331
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,040
I like to write all my own code in Python.

332
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,280
And so this will allow it
to now write my applications

333
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,070
within that Python code in CDK.

334
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,630
One of the things I also get out of this

335
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,200
is when you're using
the AWS CDK MCP server,

336
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,340
it will actually add in
a library called CDK Nag.

337
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,260
And within CDK Nag, it makes sure

338
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,350
that whatever I'm building is secure.

339
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,800
It'll actually fail a
build if it's not secure.

340
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,490
And one thing that you
might find your agent doing

341
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,380
is it might say, well, all serverless apps

342
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,680
must have WAF enabled, right?

343
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,080
But then it might say, "Well,
I'm not going to add WAF,

344
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,460
you're just building a demo."

345
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,840
So it'll put an exception in there

346
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,250
and then you can view those exceptions.

347
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,660
And if you really want it to have WAF,

348
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,580
you can remove the exception manually

349
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,137
and then tell the the agent, say,

350
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,080
"Well no, please add WAF back into it

351
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,160
and it'll go and add that

352
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,180
to make sure it's not an exception."

353
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,210
So I really like that
about the CDK MCP server

354
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,040
'cause it does make it more secure.

355
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,390
But I have seen a lot of people build

356
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,430
very insecure things using AI.

357
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,283
So that's one thing to
really watch out for.

358
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,360
It will also integrate power tools.

359
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,400
So if any of you're building
things with lambda today

360
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,890
and you're using the power tools library,

361
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,200
it has all knowledgeable power tools,

362
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,640
so it'll be able to add
that in there as well

363
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,260
to make your things
like your observability

364
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,810
a little bit better and
all the different patterns

365
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,273
that come with the power tools.

366
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,290
Then we have the AWS Core MCP Server.

367
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,490
I would say this is a really good one

368
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,230
to have pretty much all the time.

369
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,270
It has prompt understanding inside of it.

370
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,420
So if you're not the best
at prompt engineering yet,

371
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,370
and I would say like when I first started,

372
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,620
you don't really know
how to create a prompt,

373
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,720
you just kinda talk to the
thing, and hopefully, it's good,

374
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,550
and over time, I got a lot better.

375
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,670
Well, the prompt understanding
will take your input

376
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,980
and it'll turn into something
that's a little bit better

377
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
for building software on AWS.

378
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,910
So it is tailored towards that.

379
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,270
So that's what comes with
the AWS Core MCP server.

380
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,020
But as well, it has a router
for other MCP servers.

381
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,340
I don't personally use it 'cause I like

382
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,220
to be very specific on
the MCP servers I use,

383
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,230
but there's an environment
variable you can pass in

384
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,740
to the AWS core MCP server for a persona.

385
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,560
So I can say I'm a developer
persona or an architect.

386
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,290
And for those personas, it'll add a set

387
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,970
of other MCP servers with it.

388
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,050
So if you don't know which ones to use,

389
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,000
that's another good way to get started.

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,290
The AWS Documentation MCP server,

391
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,700
that's one I was referring to before.

392
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,520
It has basically access to
all up-to-date information

393
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,330
on the AWS services,
best practices, limits,

394
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,433
APIs, all that kind of stuff.

395
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,120
And then finally, a non-AWS MCP server

396
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,410
I'm gonna be using today.

397
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,870
And this is the MCP server fetch,

398
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,450
which is an anthropic MCP server.

399
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,690
Basically, it just gives
you the ability to reach out

400
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,910
to the internet and load a page.

401
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,950
So within our TicTacToe application

402
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,540
where we'll be building today,

403
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,810
the front end has an open
API spec attached to it

404
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,450
that you can actually
visualize within the UI.

405
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,490
And so I'm going to tell my prompt

406
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,180
to basically go and
pull that Open API Spec

407
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,400
and make a backend that matches it.

408
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,820
So that's how I'm gonna be using
the fetch MCP server today.

409
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,610
Any questions before
we go forward on here?

410
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,870
Yeah?
- You might cover this

411
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,430
in a second.

412
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,100
When you're using Kiro
CLI, do these things

413
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,950
just already have them or you
have to opt into each one?

414
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,370
- [Sean] Yeah, so within
actually both experiences.

415
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,180
So Kiro CL or the Kiro IDE

416
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,120
I believe comes prepackaged
with fetch, is that correct?

417
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,953
I think fetch is in there.

418
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:20,340
You have to enable it.
- But it's disabled, yeah.

419
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,810
- [Sean] It's disabled,
so you have to enable it.

420
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,873
- [Brian] Yeah, if you create
a brand new project in Kiro,

421
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,260
that there'll be one MCP
server there that's disabled,

422
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,370
which is fetch.

423
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,860
And so you can go in and you
can remove it completely,

424
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,840
you can enable it globally,
you can do whatever you want.

425
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,673
- [Audience Member] So
you're gonna have to add

426
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:36,690
all these listed, it sound great.

427
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,400
- [Sean] Yeah, so yeah,
everything else basically,

428
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,900
you have to add, and so there's a website.

429
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm gonna show you what it looks like.

430
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,810
It's a GitHub page that we maintain

431
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,140
all of our MCP servers on,
which of course you can use

432
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,860
all the AWS ones, but you can
use any MCP from anywhere.

433
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,330
Like if you purchase some SaaS software,

434
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,860
a lot of SaaS solutions are now coming out

435
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,570
with their own MCP servers.

436
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,910
You just have to download
whatever definition they give you

437
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,143
and put it into the IDE.

438
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,980
Okay, so the target architecture
we're looking for today

439
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,813
is something like this, right?

440
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,310
And just full transparency,
we built the app.

441
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,320
I actually used Kiro to build the app.

442
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,690
And then I told it to generate a diagram,

443
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,180
'cause there is a diagram
MCP server as well,

444
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,070
which I can show you later if you want.

445
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,810
And this is the diagram you came up with.

446
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,247
So first, it built the
code, it deployed the code,

447
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,020
and then it built this diagram.

448
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,480
And so today, I mean,
like I'm not actually

449
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,270
gonna feed this diagram into the prompt.

450
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,440
I could, but I'm not going to.

451
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm gonna let it kind of figure out

452
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,260
whatever it wants to do by itself.

453
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,750
If I really want to stick
to something like this,

454
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,487
then I would actually
give this to the agent,

455
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,530
and I would say, "Follow this image.

456
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,940
See how I want the architecture

457
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,620
and build this exact architecture."

458
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,330
And it would just give
it a little more guidance

459
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,760
to follow exactly what this is.

460
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,070
Now, the one thing that you
won't see us building today

461
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,320
is the left hand side of this, right?

462
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,290
So the cloud front with
the origin access control,

463
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,570
with the S3 bucket, that's
just hosting the website.

464
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,310
So I wanted to show that on the diagram.

465
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,990
But everything on the right hand side

466
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,390
is what we'll be building here today.

467
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,757
- [Brian] And just one quick shout out

468
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,723
to the serverless part of this.

469
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,880
Good luck doing this with
Kubernetes in 45 minutes, right?

470
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,713
Honestly.

471
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:15,480
And so, you know, kind of our
pitch here is that serverless,

472
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,800
you can go really fast.

473
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,010
Serverless with AI,
tooling, and MCP servers,

474
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,510
you can go really, really, really fast.

475
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,050
So it's crazy how fast Sean
and I were able to do this.

476
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,270
So we were even talking before this

477
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,800
about what if we finish early?

478
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,633
What are we gonna do next?

479
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:31,380
'Cause we can go so fast with this.

480
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,770
So just, again, shout out
to the serverless parts

481
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,613
of this talk.

482
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,480
- Okay, prompt engineering.

483
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,520
So this is the prompt
I'm gonna be feeding in

484
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,790
to at least the Kiro CLI piece of this.

485
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,050
It's probably gonna be
different from the prompt

486
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,123
that Brian's gonna use on the Kiro IDE.

487
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,640
Now, again, this is from
me working for months.

488
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,370
It's almost a lifetime in ages of AI

489
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,510
in learning prompt engineering.

490
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,090
So the first thing I tell
it is build and deploy

491
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,630
a working serverless backend
for the TicTacToe game

492
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,640
hosted at, and then a URL.

493
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,860
So this is a deployed
URL that we already have

494
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,630
that I'm gonna be plugging in here.

495
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,330
Now, you'll notice I say build and deploy.

496
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,790
And I actually put that in here

497
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,110
because I want it to build all the code

498
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,940
and deploy it without coming back to me,

499
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,930
'cause usually what I do,

500
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,640
and I don't know if my
wife likes this or not,

501
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,500
but before bed, I think of an idea.

502
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,810
I write a prompt, I hit
go, and then I go to bed

503
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,700
and it goes and builds my thing overnight.

504
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,550
Then I wake up with a
fully built application.

505
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,940
So that's why I am always
saying "build and deploy."

506
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,190
The next piece of this is I'm
actually guiding it to use

507
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,160
that fetch MCP server to view the website

508
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,600
and then open the API Spec

509
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,700
and then I give it the direct URL

510
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,000
with the URI to the OpenAPI Spec, right?

511
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,770
So I'm giving it a little
more guidance here.

512
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,460
I'm even guiding it to use
the specific MCP server

513
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,510
so it doesn't have to guess that as well.

514
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,050
I'm now telling it to build the code,

515
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,410
deploy to my default AWS account.

516
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,430
Now I put this in there,

517
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,680
because I've learned that
if I don't tell it that,

518
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,150
it says, "Well, I don't
know where to deploy it."

519
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,450
And I do have a AWS account
pre-configured on my laptop.

520
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,473
So I wanna make sure that it understands

521
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:09,270
that it's allowed to use that.

522
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,290
And if I don't put that in there,

523
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,880
I find it just doesn't do it.

524
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,477
It'll build everything, it'll
come back to me and say,

525
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,840
"Okay, what do you wanna do?"

526
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,420
So this stops it from doing that.

527
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,590
I also tell it to test the API,

528
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,420
'cause of course when
this thing's building,

529
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,290
I'm probably sleeping.

530
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,330
So I want it to make sure it deploys

531
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,160
and it comes back and
it runs all the tests

532
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,310
to make sure whatever
it did deploy is working

533
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,783
and it's working as expected.

534
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,500
On this next section that you see here,

535
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm just gonna call it a few things.

536
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,180
Handle the CORS headers.

537
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,670
Now I find, with this AI stuff,

538
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,020
it never handles CORS headers.

539
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,250
It's probably the biggest issue

540
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,810
I always see coming back,

541
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,210
where it can't actually
communicate with my backend

542
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,150
'cause the headers were
not added correctly.

543
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,180
And in fact, I tested this
a few times this morning,

544
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,950
and even though I put this in there,

545
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,450
every once in a while,
it still doesn't do it.

546
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,910
So that is some guidance
that I do give it.

547
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,700
And I also always tell
it to handle taking.

548
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,163
So I take all of my projects
with a project name.

549
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
So you see there, I see project equals,

550
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,910
and then it's gonna come
up with a project name.

551
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,590
I'm not even gonna give it a project name.

552
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,790
It'll figure that out by itself.

553
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,860
And then auto-delete=false.

554
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,650
And this is just kind
of a internal AWS thing

555
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,470
on all of our internal
AWS accounts as employees.

556
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,670
We have a script that runs every night

557
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,960
and deletes all of our resources

558
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,510
if we don't take it with this value.

559
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,603
So I do that so everything
doesn't get deleted overnight.

560
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,030
And then this final paragraph,

561
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,250
this is something I don't
actually usually include

562
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,540
in a lot of my prompts.

563
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,490
However, I built this thing so many times.

564
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,440
I've identified certain places

565
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,580
where it could potentially fail,

566
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,170
and I wanna make sure it doesn't fail.

567
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,990
So I add these few items
in here just to make sure

568
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,330
that it really understands a few things

569
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,730
that it continuously fails on.

570
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,830
And so you'll find, as
you're building in the future

571
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,360
your applications, if
there's certain things

572
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,310
that the AI is just not able to do,

573
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,110
you'll probably come up with
some of these items yourself.

574
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,150
And as you're building apps,
you'll just kind of natively

575
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,343
put those in at the bottom of your prompt.

576
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,533
Any questions?

577
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,573
Okay.

578
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,600
So let's get to coding.

579
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,390
So let me switch over to this one here.

580
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,210
And of course it didn't
load the right screen,

581
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,043
but that's okay.

582
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,053
I can fix that.

583
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,680
Okay, so what you're seeing here,

584
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,200
this is the TicTacToe
game that we built, right?

585
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,730
So very simple, right
now, you can't really see

586
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,563
anything on the screen.

587
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:36,230
There's no TicTacToe board
'cause nothing's configured.

588
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,733
But I actually do have a
previously configured game,

589
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,430
a backend that I have not yet deleted.

590
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,558
So let me push this in here to show you

591
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:48,750
what should work, right?

592
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,210
So this one, if I put this URL in here,

593
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,960
this is the URL to the backend
deployed to API gateway,

594
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,700
driven by Lambda functions.

595
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,423
So when I add that in here,
I can register player.

596
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:03,600
And there you go, so it works.

597
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,680
There's no errors on here.

598
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,153
I can start a new game,

599
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,270
and then I can start playing,

600
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,100
and I'll let the computer win this time.

601
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,933
There you go.

602
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,590
So that's basically the
entire thing that it does.

603
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,020
Now that backend was built through AI.

604
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,413
Now, I'm gonna show you how
I built that through AI.

605
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,230
And let's clear this so that
when we get our new game,

606
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,053
it's just nice and empty in here.

607
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,623
Okay, so here is my,

608
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,950
basically, the CLI.

609
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,000
And the first thing I'm gonna do

610
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,860
is I wanna add some agents into here.

611
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,260
So those MCP servers, I
already have a prebuilt agent.

612
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,150
I'll show you kind of how I built that.

613
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,420
Once you install Kiro, you're
gonna find what you have

614
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,540
is you have your file located inside of,

615
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,680
so let's open this up in Kiro.

616
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,820
So Kiro, it's in your .kiro.

617
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,740
So within your home directory, .kiro,

618
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,900
there's a directory that'll
be placed inside of there.

619
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,513
And then there's an agent's subdirectory.

620
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:03,030
And then within that subdirectory,

621
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,950
they're gonna give you a sample JSON file.

622
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,490
And that's like a default agent
that you can build yourself.

623
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,190
I've created one here called re:Invent.

624
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,170
So I'm gonna open that one here,

625
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,270
just so you can kind
of see how I built it.

626
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,070
A lot of this stuff will
come out of the box.

627
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,310
So the schema, for example,
that'll already be there.

628
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,530
You're gonna wanna give
it a name of something.

629
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,590
So whatever you wanna call
this agent, this coding agent,

630
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,090
that's how you're gonna refer to it by.

631
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,210
So right now, whenever
I start my Kiro CLI,

632
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,900
I'll always say that
minus-minus agent is re:Invent.

633
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,920
I give it a description.

634
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,180
This is really just for me.

635
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,160
So this is basically
saying that this agent

636
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,850
is able to build AWS serverless backends

637
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,870
using best practices.

638
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,430
And then I give it a prompt.

639
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,020
And the prompt is a system prompt.

640
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,660
So just imagine, every time
you wanna build something,

641
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,570
this system prompt is
gonna be there to guide

642
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,760
the AI to build in a certain way.

643
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,020
- [Brian] Sean, maybe make
it like one font bigger.

644
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,130
- [Sean] One font bigger, here.

645
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,383
Let me blow that up there.
- Thank you.

646
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,684
- Is that better?
- I'll get rid of this.

647
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:00,934
- [Brian] Yeah.

648
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,530
- [Sean] Yeah, that's probably better.

649
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,430
- [Audience Member] Just one question.

650
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,929
- Yeah?
- So is there a repo

651
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:11,429
that you guys have in with all the config?

652
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,730
- [Sean] So for most of this config,

653
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,900
as soon as you install Kiro,

654
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,370
you're gonna get that template file.

655
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,290
So I would say just like
take that template file,

656
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,720
just keep copying and pasting
it for every agent you want.

657
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,400
I think right now, I have
about like 10 agents,

658
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,520
like I have one that uses
the AWS Canvas MCP Server

659
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,920
for like generating images
for me and stuff like that.

660
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,870
I split my agents like that.

661
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,790
So I would just say, yeah,
once you install a Kiro,

662
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,980
just copy that example multiple times

663
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,130
and then just keep making
new agents based off of that.

664
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,010
There is also, I don't know
this off the top of my head,

665
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,190
but there is a Kiro CLI command that is,

666
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,690
it can generate the agent for you

667
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,970
and then it'll generate this whole spec.

668
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,850
So once you're in, sorry,
once you're in Kiro CLI,

669
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,483
you can also run that, the
generate agent command.

670
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,630
And I will show you, so
there is a repo here.

671
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,170
So you can see here, like I
do have different MCP servers.

672
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,960
So I have the core MCP
server that we talked about.

673
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,300
I have the fetch MCP server,

674
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,330
the AWS Documentation MCP
server, and so far that's it.

675
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,890
And now, you already know that I wanna add

676
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,710
a few more in here based on
that list I was showing you.

677
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,780
So I'm gonna add those in.

678
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,160
There's a few other things in here.

679
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,400
So like there's things
like allowed tools, right?

680
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,470
This allowed tools list.

681
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,670
One thing that Kiro is gonna do

682
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,830
is it's always gonna come back
if it wants to run a command

683
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,010
and it's gonna say, "Do you
want to run this command?"

684
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,510
And I would say if you're doing anything

685
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,730
in a sensitive environment, keep that on

686
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,740
so that every time
something comes back to you

687
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,840
to make sure it's not
doing like an RM minus RF

688
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,760
on a directory you wanna keep.

689
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,563
You'll have to actually allow that.

690
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,730
Everything I work on is
kind of demo purposes.

691
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,980
So I always start Kiro
CLI with a minus-a flag,

692
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,370
which means just like allow
everything and never ask me.

693
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,710
I would just say be a
little wary on that one.

694
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,300
If you're doing anything
that could potentially

695
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,610
damage your AWS account or your machine,

696
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,110
you probably want that
permission placed in there.

697
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,610
And then there's tool settings.

698
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,520
So when you start adding
MCP servers and tools,

699
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,950
when you read the documentation
for those MCP servers,

700
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,630
a lot of times, it'll come back and say,

701
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,077
like within documentation, it'll say,

702
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:12,840
"Well, you can have timeout."

703
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,600
So there's a bash timeout, for example,

704
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,160
on execute_bash, which is a tool.

705
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,230
I can say you have a
timeout of 300 seconds.

706
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,090
So that's one thing that
I've added into mind.

707
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,790
So that's where you
would put it within here.

708
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,460
Now, I'll show you how to
add a different MCP server.

709
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,020
So now of course this
is more of the CLI way,

710
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,650
which I think is actually
similar anyways to the IDE way.

711
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,580
But there's a GitHub, AWS Labs GitHub.

712
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,130
I'm gonna show you guys
a QR code at the end

713
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,810
where you can link to this.

714
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,587
But basically, this has
all of the AWS MCP servers,

715
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:48,390
and of course there are thousands

716
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,650
of MCP servers out on the internet.

717
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,900
These are just the ones
that AWS has curated.

718
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,863
So in here, I'm gonna
search for serverless,

719
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,063
and I have this AWS serverless MCP server.

720
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,550
Once I come in here, I can
quickly click these buttons.

721
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,740
So if I wanna add it to cursor or VS code,

722
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,850
I can do that from here.

723
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,040
Now, because I'm doing it on the CLI way,

724
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,060
I'm simply gonna copy
the JSON from in here,

725
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,980
come back into my IDE,

726
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,523
scroll up to my MCP
server list, and paste it.

727
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:24,990
And because I use a
default configured profile,

728
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,460
I'm just gonna delete
this environment stuff,

729
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,410
'cause that's where I can
add a specific profile

730
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,057
or region if I need that.

731
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:33,933
And if I get rid of that,
it'll use my default one.

732
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,473
So the next thing I'm
gonna do is come in here.

733
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,010
So right now, I'm sitting
within a directory on my machine

734
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,060
that has nothing inside of it.

735
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,930
So if I show you here, all
I have is a prompt.text

736
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,250
and that's just so I can easily access

737
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,480
that prompt I showed you.

738
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,550
So there's nothing else in
here, and this is the directory

739
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,560
where I'm gonna start building everything.

740
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,933
So I'm gonna start with Kiro CLI.

741
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,430
Now, I use a command "chat,"

742
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,840
which means I can use additional flag.

743
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
So this is giving me the ability
to use this minus-a flag,

744
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,370
which says just do anything,
never ask me for permissions.

745
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,570
And that's because I'm eventually

746
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,240
gonna hand this off to Brian
so my computer can keep working

747
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,350
and then his can start building on the IDE

748
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,700
and then for the-
- Is that bigger?

749
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,000
- [Sean] Oh, bigger, yeah.

750
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,170
- Thank you.
- Thanks for that.

751
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,360
All right, and then minus, minus agent.

752
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
And then I type in "reinvent."

753
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,450
That is that name of that agent

754
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,433
that I created within that JSON file.

755
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,100
Now, as soon as I open this here,

756
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,970
you're gonna see it's gonna load

757
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,770
my different MCP servers and validate.

758
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,240
I did have four in there.

759
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,240
So the core MCP serverless
fetch and documentation.

760
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,233
So yeah, that is correct.

761
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,340
Now, within here, there are a whole bunch

762
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,803
of commands you can run,
so if you type slash,

763
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,280
you can see there's all
these different commands.

764
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,770
So for one, if you wanna
manage your agents,

765
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,820
if you do have multiple agents,

766
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,200
you can do the /agent command,

767
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,800
which then has that generation
feature inside of it.

768
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,570
But the other thing you can do

769
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,190
is just start typing your prompt, right?

770
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,130
So if I open up my prompt here,

771
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,210
which I have saved over here,

772
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,000
and you can see I've pre-filled
in the website address

773
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,163
to our TicTacToe game,

774
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm simply just gonna push this in here.

775
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,973
And that's really it.

776
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:27,870
Now, I am using some experimental features

777
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,220
within the Kiro CLI.

778
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,350
So if you ever type /experiment,

779
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,330
you'll see there's about six
different features in there.

780
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,740
One of them is a to-do list.

781
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,870
And you're gonna notice,
after it starts loading,

782
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,970
like right now, it's actually
fetching out to the internet,

783
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,417
loading that website, saying,

784
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,420
"Now I understand the requirements."

785
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,890
And now I created that to-do list.

786
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,270
So that's actually an
experimental feature.

787
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,220
So if you wanna use that,
I find it's really good

788
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,860
'cause it gives it more of
that chain of thought process

789
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,450
to build an application.

790
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,390
And I actually personally enable
all experimental features.

791
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,770
There's things like checkpoints in there,

792
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,600
so it's kinda like almost a git commit,

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,043
but it's local to Kiro.

794
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,070
Anyway, so we're gonna let this build.

795
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,200
It's gonna go off and do
everything that it needs to do.

796
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,940
Now we'll switch over here to Brian

797
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,700
so he can show you how to
build it within the IDE.

798
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,533
Is there any questions

799
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,463
while we're just switching laptops here?

800
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,213
(speaking indistinctly)

801
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:26,595
Okay.

802
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,669
So the question, is it persistent?

803
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,400
So it's actually using a Git
repository behind the scenes.

804
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,900
That's what the tool's actually doing.

805
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,770
So it is persistent.

806
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,650
So if you were to exit out of
Kiro and then come back in,

807
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,570
now, whenever you come into the Kiro CLI

808
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,070
a second time after leaving,

809
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,750
you use a minus minus resume flag,

810
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,820
and then that resumes
back from where it ended,

811
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,520
and then it'll pick up
on those checkpoints.

812
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,120
And also, the conversations
are stored in a directory

813
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,865
within that .kiro in your home directory.

814
00:32:57,865 --> 00:32:59,670
So your conversation history
is all stored within there.

815
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,680
So every time you type minus-minus resume

816
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,660
in a folder that you're currently in,

817
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,360
it loads your conversation from there.

818
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,070
So everything is persistent in there.

819
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,870
Now, I'll pass it over to Brian here.

820
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,240
- [Brian] Okay, so here we go.

821
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,800
So this is the Kiro IDE.

822
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,483
So real, real quick tour.

823
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,100
Just like VS code or any other IDE stuff,

824
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,420
navigations on the left here
are my files, my file system.

825
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,420
And then in the upper
right, click on that,

826
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,130
and that is our chat
interface to our agent.

827
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,250
And like I said, the beginning
over here on the left,

828
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,937
there's this Kiro icon,
and if you click on that

829
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,030
and is that large enough?

830
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,770
Can you guys see this okay?

831
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,360
Yeah, okay.

832
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,860
So there's these spec things on top,

833
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,560
which we will get into if we have time.

834
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,270
Agent Hooks, we also won't cover this,

835
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,860
but I can talk to that.

836
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,690
And then Agent Steering docs,

837
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,965
which I'll show you how
to create something there.

838
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,040
And then the MCP servers
down here on the left.

839
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,180
So you can see I already have
four of these that are set up.

840
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,130
And so if I click on this icon
that it says open MTP config,

841
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,300
there are two parts to this.

842
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,130
One is the user config.

843
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,880
So this is laptop-wide.

844
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,677
So like Sean said, the documentation,

845
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,710
the MCP server enabled that one globally.

846
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,760
I mean, there's no really no reason

847
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,810
to have that per project.

848
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,600
So you can see in here the second one,

849
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,920
well, the first, there's two of them.

850
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,640
There's Knowledge MCP and the
AWS Documentation MTP Server.

851
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,380
So that's under my user configuration.

852
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,510
So whenever I'm logged into my laptop,

853
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,230
those two things are gonna
be enabled all the time.

854
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,940
And then the Workplace Config.

855
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,190
And actually, I changed
directory so that one's empty.

856
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,090
So there's nothing.

857
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,470
So the things that you see on the left now

858
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,923
are on my laptop no matter
what project I'm working on.

859
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:50,047
So to enable, and I'll just
do it real quick, AWS MCP.

860
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,330
So I'll do just what Sean did.

861
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,283
I'll make this bigger, serverless.

862
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,723
That guy.

863
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,303
And then we're gonna copy this,

864
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,490
and then all I'm doing
is I'm pacing it in here.

865
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,820
Again, this is the
workspace-specific configuration.

866
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,370
So this will only be enabled
for this one workspace.

867
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,095
Question?
- So for the workspace,

868
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:22,050
is this gonna live within the repo?

869
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,840
So my team of developers, I'll get this,

870
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,780
or is this a per machine configuration

871
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,850
that they have to do for their workspace?

872
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,160
- [Sean] Yeah, so you
can see right in here.

873
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
So this is in a directory,

874
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,328
a .kiro directory in this project.

875
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:39,161
- Okay.
- Yeah.

876
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:39,994
So as long as you commit that

877
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:42,000
and as long as everyone's using Kiro.

878
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,373
- [Brian] Yeah.

879
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:46,080
And now here I need to put in this,

880
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:51,670
and this is just the name of my profile.

881
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,410
I'm gonna save that, and as I save that,

882
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,660
now you'll see it's spinning
over here on the left.

883
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,460
And assuming I got the typing correct,

884
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,083
that should be enabled next.

885
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,590
Okay, so while that's going,

886
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,270
I'm gonna talk about, yeah,
so that one's working now.

887
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,430
So I'm gonna talk real
quick about Steering Docs.

888
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,430
So Sean has his setup for the Kiro CLI.

889
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,020
So a Steering doc is something

890
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
that the agent will reference back to

891
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,650
whenever it's given a task.

892
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,630
And you can tell it to
look at these Steering docs

893
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,190
based on file extension.

894
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,750
And frankly, I don't know
all the different ways

895
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,520
to configure it in terms of

896
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,050
telling the agent when to look at it.

897
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,090
But I'm gonna create a
couple of Steering docs

898
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,820
that informs the agent how
to build this application.

899
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,130
So these are really tips and tricks

900
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,670
to help guide the agent
when it's doing some work.

901
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,260
And I'm gonna do that by clicking this.

902
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,120
This literally changed I think last week.

903
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,820
So this is a little bit new to me.

904
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,270
I'm gonna create a Steering
document from scratch,

905
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,980
and it says here, "It only applies

906
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,510
within this specific workspace."

907
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,070
So that's what I want.

908
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,550
And I'm just gonna call this AWS SAM.

909
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,147
And so you can see here, it says,

910
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:09,540
"Okay, I'm gonna include this always."

911
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,310
And there's a link which I haven't read,

912
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,530
but you guys should definitely read this.

913
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,113
But these are some rules about what to do,

914
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,810
again, while the agent is working.

915
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,810
So I'm gonna delete this stuff real quick,

916
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,840
and I have something on my clipboard,

917
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,780
which is this one.

918
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,613
Not that-
- See your credit card

919
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,780
number on there?
- That's definitely.

920
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,580
That's the one where you hit like star on.

921
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,570
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Allow all.

922
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,280
That was the credit card.

923
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Let me go and find it real quick, sorry.

924
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,803
AWS SAM, that's what I want.

925
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,323
We copy, whoops.

926
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:48,954
Okay.

927
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,080
Okay, so if you look at,

928
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,530
this is pretty terse.

929
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,760
There's not much here.

930
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,080
So it just says, "Hey, this is a project

931
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,423
built with Python 313 and AWS SAM.

932
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,783
Here's some instructions:

933
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,140
"To test the build, run this.

934
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,730
To deploy it, run this.

935
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,100
If there are any code changes,
you can run SAM sync."

936
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,150
So it's really sparse.

937
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,443
There's not a lot here.

938
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:16,980
The code here is literally,

939
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,190
all I did was I ran AWS SAM in it.

940
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,500
So I said in it, it's a
HelloWorld application.

941
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,660
It does nothing other
than print out HelloWorld.

942
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,613
But it does deploy, but that's all I did.

943
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:27,783
I mean, it took me two minutes.

944
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,030
So what I'm gonna do now,

945
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,090
and this is I think a nice
feature of the IDE is,

946
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,420
you'll notice there's this
refine button in the upper right.

947
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,650
So I'm gonna click that,

948
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,010
and what that's gonna do is
it's gonna ask the agent,

949
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,460
take this prompt here,
the steering document.

950
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,030
It's also gonna look at the
code that I have in the project,

951
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:52,890
and it's going to refine or
improve my steering document.

952
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,420
And so that's what it's going through now.

953
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,253
So there we go.

954
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,703
So now, we're done.

955
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,180
But if you look at it now,
it's much more verbose.

956
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,180
It's a little bit more thorough,
and it's more complete.

957
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,500
So again, I mean, I'll just
pick some random stuff.

958
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,690
So here, it's saying like
what to do with sync.

959
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,020
The project structure, so it
looked at the file system.

960
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,570
So it realizes the template is
the template for the SAM app.

961
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,143
The source directory contains
all the function code, great.

962
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,720
And there's some other things in here.

963
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,070
Oftentimes, I mean, what
I have found is that,

964
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,320
oftentimes, with a
small project like this,

965
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,430
a lot of the work involved
is telling it what not to do.

966
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,810
So if you don't tell
it, skip the unit test,

967
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,210
skip the integration test,
don't worry about that,

968
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,080
oftentimes, these agents will
start creating a lot of things

969
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,700
that you don't want or need.

970
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,970
So that's just one thing
that I've noticed over time.

971
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,143
So be aware of that.

972
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,150
So I created one.

973
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,640
So now, in the Steering
documents, we have one,

974
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,690
which is AWS SAM.

975
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,060
I'm gonna copy another one,

976
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,493
which is the product.

977
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,503
Copy.

978
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,750
Alright, so I'm gonna add another one.

979
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,453
I'm gonna call, say this product.

980
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,373
And it's that.

981
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,210
Okay, so same thing.

982
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,390
There's not a lot here, but
these are just some tips.

983
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,407
Sean mentioned CORs, right?

984
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:29,040
We saw that the agents
didn't get that, right?

985
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,190
So there's a specific instruction
on there to handle it.

986
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,620
I've got something specific
for Lambda power tools,

987
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,110
and I say I want you to
use Lambda power tools

988
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,730
but install it as a layer.

989
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,913
So I will hit Refine and
then answer your question.

990
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:45,150
Yeah?
- Do these feature

991
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,150
be a good way to prompt the
agent to not, for instance,

992
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:58,890
read environment variables
like from secret credentials,

993
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:03,727
or is it a better way
on Kiro to prevent that?

994
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,120
- [Brian] So the question is,

995
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,850
are Steering documents a good way

996
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:13,320
to have the agent not read
environment variables or not?

997
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,310
Yeah, I would say yes.

998
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,330
I mean, the Steering documents
are a way to guide the agent

999
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,760
to behave how you want it to behave.

1000
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,710
So if you don't want it to do something,

1001
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,860
that's absolutely what I would
recommend putting in here.

1002
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,970
- [Audience Member]
And I would assume that

1003
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,620
all these instructions,
well, they go on each request

1004
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,620
that we make to the underlying model

1005
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,650
and hence they consume-

1006
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,760
- [Brian] Tokens.

1007
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,560
- Tokens.
- Yep.

1008
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,520
Yeah, and if you look here,

1009
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,830
here it says inclusion always, right?

1010
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,270
So in this case, yeah.

1011
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,110
And you'll see.

1012
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,760
Let me start this and then

1013
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,200
I'll move on to the next question.

1014
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,503
So just to bring us back,

1015
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,110
I have got my MCP service configured,

1016
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:00,110
I've got two agent steering
documents, so that's great.

1017
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,263
I'm gonna close these, and
now I'm gonna get my prompt,

1018
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,457
which is gonna be 'pbcopy.'

1019
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,820
It's fair also fairly short.

1020
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,830
So I'm gonna create a new session here.

1021
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,810
I could create, go on
on with a new session.

1022
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,150
But I think it's easier just to do this.

1023
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,690
So this is not a spec-driven prompt.

1024
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,590
This is gonna be a vibe,

1025
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,440
which is just a regular
prompt, like what Sean's doing.

1026
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,790
So I'm gonna paste this in here.

1027
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,030
So I need help to implement a
serverless TicTacToe backend

1028
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,780
that abides by the OpenAPI
Spec, which is hosted here,

1029
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,375
build this backend for me
using the AWS SAM application

1030
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,920
in this repository.

1031
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,010
Make sure to keep the
implementation simple.

1032
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,320
I do not need unit tests
or integration tests.

1033
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,450
So that's all I'm gonna say.

1034
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,693
So I'm gonna hit Enter,

1035
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,750
and then I'm gonna switch over here

1036
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,870
so we can see the files that's creating,

1037
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,053
and then I will answer the next question.

1038
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,056
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1039
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:01,389
(speaking indistinctly)

1040
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,783
- [Audience Member]
Basically what I'm trying say

1041
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:08,700
is that I saw the plan option,
which maybe it's available

1042
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,260
as part of Kiro CLI, so whatever
you can do with Kiro CLI

1043
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,880
and the IDE, uses the same
underlying infrastructure,

1044
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,380
whatever, so I can actually
do everything either.

1045
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,970
- [Sean] Yeah, so the question is,

1046
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,463
are the CLI and the IDE at parity?

1047
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,380
The short answer to that
is right now they're not.

1048
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,480
So there are features that
are starting to come to both.

1049
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,070
The intent is in the future,

1050
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,450
and I don't have a timeline for this,

1051
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,190
but they will be at parity,

1052
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,990
but one thing we noticed this morning

1053
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,710
is within my experimental
features on the CLI, right?

1054
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,910
So there was,

1055
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,260
which feature was it that
just came to the IDE?

1056
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,493
- [Brian] The checkpoints.

1057
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,400
- [Sean] Checkpoints, right.

1058
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,250
So checkpoints just came
to the IDE recently,

1059
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,937
that's been in the CLI for a little bit,

1060
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:57,780
and it is actually still
experimental in the CLI.

1061
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,700
So they are coming to parity.

1062
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,520
The underlying service is
the same, however, right?

1063
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,780
Like you are using the same models,

1064
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,530
they're using the anthropic models.

1065
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,070
By default, they all use a
router to get to the best model

1066
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,350
for whatever you're trying to do,

1067
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,230
or you can actually
specify an exact model.

1068
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,110
The models do have different
tokens that they take.

1069
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,310
So if you're gonna use the
anthropic Claude 4.5 Sonnet,

1070
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,860
I think that's like a 1.3 multiplier.

1071
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,850
Don't quote me on that exactly,

1072
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,270
but it's something like 1.3,
whereas if you use sonnet four,

1073
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:34,250
it's only times multiplier, right?

1074
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,300
So you use more tokens on the higher ones,

1075
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,090
and of course, tokens
then cost money, right?

1076
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,933
So when you purchase Kiro,

1077
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:42,150
this is me comes back
to the other question

1078
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,970
from before on like the pricing, right?

1079
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,500
You can use Kiro for free, right?

1080
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,140
You can use a builder
ID to sign up for free.

1081
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,270
You can use an enterprise license,

1082
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,280
and they all have different token limits.

1083
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,600
And of course on enterprise license,

1084
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,650
actually, I think on any license,

1085
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,820
you can continuously buy
more tokens or more credits.

1086
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,460
I may have that kind of
nomenclature messed up a little bit.

1087
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,440
All this stuff is quite new. (chuckles)

1088
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,480
But anyways, short answer is yes.

1089
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,650
They will eventually come to parity.

1090
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,263
Not today, but-
- So in the future,

1091
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,460
a new feature is introduced
to the CLI first,

1092
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,950
or do you see that in the-

1093
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,500
- [Sean] So far, it's been kind of,

1094
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,180
there's been no one place where it starts.

1095
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,500
I think there's different
teams working on them.

1096
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,480
So whoever kind of gets
to the features first

1097
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,040
I guess release first.

1098
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,510
Yeah, like the steering docs right now

1099
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,673
is only within the IDE.

1100
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,310
However, some of those
other experimental features

1101
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,093
were only available on the
CLI up until just recently.

1102
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,880
Question?
- Refine feature,

1103
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,440
which may not be available on CLI maybe.

1104
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
- [Brian] Yeah, and if you think so, yeah,

1105
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,010
the comment was the
refined feature in the IDE

1106
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,717
is really nice, 100%.

1107
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:51,300
And I think it really
depends on what you prefer

1108
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,370
in terms of your, I mean, I'm old,

1109
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:58,320
I like using Vim and and a
terminal, but I like that.

1110
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,670
I like just clicking a button.

1111
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,180
You can do the same thing in the CLI.

1112
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,680
I mean, 'cause at the end of the day,

1113
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,750
all it's doing is it's giving it a prompt.

1114
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,280
It's giving the model some information,

1115
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,080
and saying, "Go and do this for me."

1116
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:16,130
But then including it whenever
you're running a task,

1117
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,053
there's just some niceties.

1118
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:19,650
It's more of like a quality of life thing.

1119
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,960
It just depends on what your experience

1120
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,700
you want to look like.

1121
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,350
- [Audience Member] So it
seems like the MCP servers

1122
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,570
that you're using are local MCP servers.

1123
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,300
Are there remote?
- Yep.

1124
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,220
These are all remote, yep, yep.

1125
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,740
Yeah, so in there,
there are different ways

1126
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,770
to interact with an MCP server.

1127
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,930
Most of these are using
a command called UVX,

1128
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,943
which runs the UV tool,
which is a Python thing.

1129
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:45,161
I don't know if you know that,

1130
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:48,947
but the folks who make rough in UV,

1131
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:50,310
UVX is just a way to exit.

1132
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,930
It's kind of like NPX.

1133
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,430
It's a way to run a command locally

1134
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,200
without having to install the package.

1135
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,510
But yeah, it's just running a command,

1136
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,030
and then it connects to the remote system.

1137
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,390
- [Sean] It does support
remote and local MCP servers.

1138
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,850
So like I do a lot of MCP development

1139
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,320
and I always run it just locally,

1140
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,300
'cause I have the code local
and I register it locally

1141
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,300
and then it just all stays on my laptop.

1142
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,920
Yeah, it does support both.

1143
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,290
So pretty much anything that's
just an MCP, it'll support.

1144
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,560
Now, I did notice, so
about five minutes after

1145
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,320
I think I typed my prompt
here, it finished, right?

1146
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,330
So I'm gonna show you kind
of what it ended up doing,

1147
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,250
and then we'll test it just to
make sure it actually works.

1148
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,090
- [Brian] Mine finished too.

1149
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,290
Just saying, just saying.

1150
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,123
- [Sean] There we go.

1151
00:47:29,123 --> 00:47:31,020
Does yours tell you how long it took?

1152
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,520
- No.
- Oh, I think mine does.

1153
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,590
Okay.
(both laughing)

1154
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,900
So you'll see here, like
it's very chatty, right?

1155
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,230
So like here's basically all
the output it's given me,

1156
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,130
that to-do list.

1157
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,520
It was showing me a lot
of the code it's writing,

1158
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,890
and I'm just gonna keep
scrolling through this here.

1159
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,630
It did actually finish the deployment

1160
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,640
and then it ran tests itself.

1161
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,830
So you can see here it's actually running

1162
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,810
git commands using curl.

1163
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,160
So it decided that on its own.

1164
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,320
I didn't tell it what to do with testing.

1165
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,280
It's running its own tests

1166
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,380
without actually writing a unit test.

1167
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,910
I could have also told
it to write a unit test,

1168
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,460
if I really wanted to replay
that a bunch of times.

1169
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,070
And here, see its even testing,

1170
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,180
make sure I get different
errors when I need them

1171
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,760
or when I expect them
out of the application.

1172
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,670
And then finally, let's
scroll all the way down.

1173
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,780
There we go, my to-do list.

1174
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,640
It shows it's completely done.

1175
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,620
It gives me an endpoint.

1176
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,570
You are also, I'm gonna copy that,

1177
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,540
and then it tells me it took
5 minutes and 11 seconds.

1178
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,390
So I don't think we're
gonna be able to get

1179
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:31,560
that out of yours, but hey, that's fine.

1180
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,970
- [Brian] Mine was five
minutes and 10 seconds.

1181
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,620
- [Sean] Yeah, I don't know
about that, all right. (laughs)

1182
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,720
So I'll go back to the app here.

1183
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,450
I'm gonna configure it, and this may fail.

1184
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,283
We'll see.

1185
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,983
Register player.

1186
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,283
Hey, it worked.

1187
00:48:46,283 --> 00:48:47,970
- There we go.
- Here we go.

1188
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,950
I've done this a few times
this morning, by the way.

1189
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,750
And this is the first time
it worked on the first try.

1190
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,040
It's been giving me those corsairs

1191
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,080
every other time for some reason.

1192
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,020
So there we go, so I just came
up with a validation error.

1193
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,850
And I actually liked that
it failed on something.

1194
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,410
If it didn't, then you
probably would've thought

1195
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,660
that I was faking it somehow.

1196
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,740
So I'm just gonna take that error,

1197
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:08,790
I'm gonna post it into my
CLI, and then literally,

1198
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,710
I didn't even get any context here, right?

1199
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,645
So all I'm doing is I'm just
giving it the error message.

1200
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,850
It's gonna know that's an error message.

1201
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:15,787
And you can see already it says,

1202
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,640
"Oh, there's a validation error."

1203
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,130
It knows the issue, it
found the issue that fast.

1204
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,603
It's now rewriting the code,

1205
00:49:22,624 --> 00:49:23,457
and it looks like, yeah,

1206
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:24,630
it's gonna write that code down to a file,

1207
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,560
it's gonna deploy it,

1208
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,630
it's using SAM build and SAM deploy.

1209
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,200
So it did build it using AWS SAM.

1210
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,690
And then once this is done,

1211
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,340
it may or may not rerun these tests.

1212
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,380
This is the one thing,
this is all deterministic,

1213
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,240
so it does whatever it wants,

1214
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,520
which again is why you gotta
be safe with that minus-a flag

1215
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,110
because when it does whatever it wants,

1216
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,960
it might do something you don't want.

1217
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:47,730
And then once it is done,
we'll test it again.

1218
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,950
In the meantime, I guess we
can answer another question.

1219
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,330
- [Brian] I can try mine too, but yeah.

1220
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,230
Answer a question while I switch over.

1221
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:55,890
- [Audience Member] The
SAM, when you mentioned SAM,

1222
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:58,860
automatically takes care
of the gateway as well,

1223
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,803
or gateway, we have to
mention it separately.

1224
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,453
Should be configured in the pool,

1225
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,037
the gateway and routing it to the-

1226
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,273
- [Sean] You mean, like API gateway or-

1227
00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:14,730
- Yeah, API.
- Yeah.

1228
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,130
So it's building it in SAM, right?

1229
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,360
So it's using the SAM specs

1230
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,130
to build all the infrastructures code.

1231
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,350
Then it's using the SAM
CLI to actually build

1232
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,450
and deploy the application as well.

1233
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,950
So it's selected-

1234
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,650
- [Audience Member] Take
care of building the gateway?

1235
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,380
- [Sean] Oh, yeah, it
did everything, yeah.

1236
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,690
It built the gateway, it built
all the lambda functions.

1237
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,130
It wrote all the code
for the lambda functions,

1238
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,450
and it deployed it.

1239
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,193
It did the whole thing, right?

1240
00:50:39,234 --> 00:50:40,140
And usually, I would guide it to you CDK.

1241
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,810
I didn't wanna do that this time,

1242
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,840
'cause usually with CDK, it
takes a little bit longer.

1243
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,880
There's just a lot more
code that it'll write,

1244
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,757
but, oh look, yours failed too.

1245
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,020
- [Brian] Mine failed too.

1246
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,270
This worked in five minutes
yesterday, honestly.

1247
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,693
- [Sean] Well, here, I'm
gonna switch back and see if,

1248
00:50:58,434 --> 00:50:59,340
okay, you do your error thing.

1249
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,440
So see it might not always be single shot.

1250
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,120
A lot of times, I can do
things in a single shot,

1251
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,400
but not 100% of the time.

1252
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,350
So there we go, I'm back on mine here.

1253
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,940
It fixed the error.

1254
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,530
It gave me the same endpoint name.

1255
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,700
So I'm just gonna-

1256
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,380
- [Audience Member] I
noticed one thing though.

1257
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,310
- Yeah?
- I see a lot

1258
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,650
where it's tracking a percentage.

1259
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,892
So I see 22, now it's at 23.

1260
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:20,100
What is that percentage?

1261
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,650
- [Sean] That is my context window.

1262
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,150
So that's another experimental feature.

1263
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,170
So the question was,

1264
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,300
there's a percentage
being tracked on the CLI.

1265
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,410
That is my context window.

1266
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,690
- [Audience Member] Is
it managing that window?

1267
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,760
So as it increases above the threshold,

1268
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,593
is that something that's gonna-

1269
00:51:33,593 --> 00:51:35,280
- [Sean] It will, yeah.

1270
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,930
So as the context window reaches 100,

1271
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,903
it will auto compact it and then I can-

1272
00:51:41,463 --> 00:51:43,440
- [Audience Member] Summarization or it's-

1273
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,880
- [Brian] Yeah, it summarizes it.

1274
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,890
- [Sean] Yeah, and so the
problem with summarization

1275
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,380
is sometimes I lose some of
the context I wanna give.

1276
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,510
So I do notice that if
I'm doing a lot of coding

1277
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,370
and it summarizes, I do have to go back

1278
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,810
and give it a little more information

1279
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,283
that it may have lost, right?

1280
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,000
Okay, let's just quickly
test this and see if-

1281
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,290
- [Brian] Yes, mine was CORs,

1282
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,487
even though I was very clear,

1283
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,953
"Hey, this is how you
should handle a CORs."

1284
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:06,630
It was a CORs issue.

1285
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,593
- Was it?
- Yep.

1286
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,771
- [Sean] Oh, there we go, so it's working.

1287
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:13,380
Is it that smart?

1288
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,000
No, it's not that smart.

1289
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,480
So right now, it's pretty
much just, I think,

1290
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,103
randomly placing.

1291
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,380
Yeah, it's not that smart.

1292
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,917
So I would now probably go back and say,

1293
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:25,290
"Okay, I keep winning the game.

1294
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,890
You're not placing your
turns where they should be.

1295
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,730
Improve your algorithm."

1296
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,770
That would be almost my next step here.

1297
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,847
In fact, here, let me
just quickly do that.

1298
00:52:33,847 --> 00:52:36,213
"Improve the computer.

1299
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,747
It's impossible for me to win."

1300
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,654
There was a question over here.

1301
00:52:46,654 --> 00:52:47,550
- [Audience Member] Does it store

1302
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,293
the infrastructure code somewhere?

1303
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,930
- [Sean] Yeah, so the
question is does it store

1304
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,075
the infrastructures code somewhere?

1305
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:59,433
The answer to that is I hope so.

1306
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:04,923
So I don't think I actually
told it to do that.

1307
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:09,210
No, yeah, it did.

1308
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,040
Well, let's see, did it
write everything in here?

1309
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,420
There's just the SAM stuff template.

1310
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,060
Oh yeah, 'cause it's using
SAM just a template.yaml.

1311
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,510
So in here, you're gonna see
I have my DynamoDB table,

1312
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,920
I have my serverless function.

1313
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,050
So that's gonna be a Lambda function.

1314
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,450
So yeah, everything in here
is infrastructure as code.

1315
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,220
Now, again, like usually with
the apps I like to build,

1316
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,890
I'll tell it to you CDK, then
it'll do a whole CDK and knit,

1317
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,410
and it'll write all the
Python files and all that.

1318
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,770
It just takes a bit longer for that,

1319
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,353
but that is all in there.

1320
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,660
Does yours work now?

1321
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,610
- It's deploying right now.
- Okay, his is deploying.

1322
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,443
- [Brian] Yep.

1323
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,203
- [Audience Member] For your steering,

1324
00:53:42,203 --> 00:53:46,560
like one of the things that
I've seen practiced work

1325
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,010
really good is having
some more generic snippets

1326
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,720
that go along with the architecture.

1327
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,030
Are you guys seeing the same
for your steering files,

1328
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,640
or is it really just kind
of giving the high level

1329
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,200
of just like directory structure

1330
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,142
where the button and kind of get that way?

1331
00:54:00,142 --> 00:54:01,543
- [Sean] And are you saying that like

1332
00:54:01,543 --> 00:54:03,150
you like to give it code snippets of-

1333
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:03,983
- [Audience Member] Yeah, right.

1334
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:06,930
Like maybe not so much
from the serverless angle,

1335
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,007
but like, here's how we write fast API,

1336
00:54:11,007 --> 00:54:12,970
the documentation that goes along with it.

1337
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,139
Here's an example of-

1338
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:16,809
- Okay.
- And like

1339
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:19,740
if it needs to drill into
it more, then giving it

1340
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,570
the link to the additional documents

1341
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,900
so it can then go to that.

1342
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,470
Are you guys seeing like-

1343
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,960
- Yeah, so the question is,

1344
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,890
within the steering docs,

1345
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,330
do you give it a little bit more context?

1346
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,310
Maybe it's code examples
or links to a website

1347
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,540
that has better code examples.

1348
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,090
Maybe a GitHub repository,
something like that.

1349
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,640
That is something I do
with more complex projects.

1350
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,420
So I write a lot of code to build myself

1351
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,213
Agent COR Services.

1352
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,790
Does everyone know what Agent COR is?

1353
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,293
Who knows what Agent COR is?

1354
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,803
Not that many hands.

1355
00:54:51,803 --> 00:54:55,440
Okay, Agent COR very
quickly is a new AWS service

1356
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,870
that was released months ago,

1357
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,270
and it is a service you can use to build

1358
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,770
and host your agents.

1359
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,270
Well, the problem with
it is there's not a lot

1360
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,790
of documentation today
within these models.

1361
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,050
They don't really understand it.

1362
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,920
So a lot of times, I will
create some steering docs

1363
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,920
and you can actually add
steering docs within the CLI.

1364
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,480
You put them in as Read Me
files within your project,

1365
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,910
or you can put them
within the agent config.

1366
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,547
But yeah, a lot of times, I
will put code examples in there,

1367
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:24,870
'cause I know it doesn't
know about this service yet.

1368
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:25,710
It's too new, right?

1369
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,360
I almost have to wait for
like the next set of models

1370
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,210
to come out so it
understands it a bit more.

1371
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,370
There's even no great
MCP service for it today.

1372
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,710
So I do sometimes give it
some code examples like here.

1373
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,200
This is how you do this,
so you can continue doing

1374
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,053
all the stuff that you know how to do.

1375
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,410
And then I'll give a little
bit of guidance with that.

1376
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,420
And I usually only do
that after I find out

1377
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,130
that the agent cannot build something.

1378
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,983
So I always let it try the first time.

1379
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:54,371
- [Audience Member] You added four MCPs.

1380
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:57,143
Is it like necessary that
all four (indistinct),

1381
00:55:57,143 --> 00:56:00,889
only COR is necessary and
remaining are optional?

1382
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:02,693
- [Sean] Yeah, so the question is,

1383
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,770
I added four MCP servers.

1384
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,830
Do I need all of those
or are they all optional?

1385
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,680
I mean, really, all MCP
servers are optional, right?

1386
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,450
But if you're building something

1387
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:15,240
and you need reference to, let's say,

1388
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,580
if you were building this in CDK-

1389
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,560
Yeah, so for this
example, like the CDK one,

1390
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,610
I probably could have removed.

1391
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,620
In fact, I don't even know
if I included it, actually.

1392
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,820
I know I had it in my slide,

1393
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,990
but I don't know if I
actually included that

1394
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,030
because I'm not building CDK.

1395
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,620
But if I was gonna now build this in CDK,

1396
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,930
I would add that back in to
make sure it can do that.

1397
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,110
So be very prescriptive over
the MCP servers you're using.

1398
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,390
Every MCP server you
add with all the tools

1399
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,800
that come with that MCP server,

1400
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,780
it does add tokens to your context.

1401
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,180
So it becomes a little
more expensive to build.

1402
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,670
And the more MCP servers you have,

1403
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,200
the dumber it gets, right?

1404
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,060
Because it has too many things to look at

1405
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,470
and too many things to decide.

1406
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,843
So curate it for kind of what you need.

1407
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,059
Yeah, question over here.

1408
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:58,113
- [Audience Member] This
is a specific to Kiro IDE.

1409
00:57:00,943 --> 00:57:05,103
You showed early JSON
definition of an agent.

1410
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,460
Is there a way in the Kiro IDE,

1411
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,980
if I'm working on a project to select,

1412
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,730
like I want to use this
agent, and therefore,

1413
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,820
I configure all the MCP servers

1414
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,773
that I will need for that use case?

1415
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,560
- [Brian] So your question is,

1416
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,773
so these things over here
were the MCP configs.

1417
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:34,427
- [Audience Member] Yeah,
but that's a configuration

1418
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:37,170
of the IDE that can be done for the user

1419
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,071
and for the workspace.

1420
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,565
Now.
- Yep.

1421
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:43,080
- [Audience Member] Is
there a way that we can have

1422
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,760
something outside, like the
agent file that you show early,

1423
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,103
where when I can have, for instance,

1424
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,170
an agent for Python applications,

1425
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,420
an agent for Node.js application,

1426
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,590
and whenever I work on a Node.js project,

1427
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:06,590
I can somehow use that
agent instead of having to-

1428
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,730
- [Brian] I see, adding
it one by one, yeah.

1429
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,260
So your question is, yeah, is there a way

1430
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:15,090
to have specific MCP servers
using specific situations,

1431
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,590
like a frontend application,

1432
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,630
a Python backend application?

1433
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,400
I don't know of a way of doing that

1434
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,980
like for your entire system,

1435
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,430
where it's really specific
like that for the MCP servers.

1436
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,470
The resolution that I know about here

1437
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,860
is either it's for your user
or it's for a workspace.

1438
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,450
Those are the two that I know about.

1439
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,393
- [Audience Member] But
since I think the CLI

1440
00:58:36,393 --> 00:58:41,393
has a special command
agent that you can use

1441
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,460
to manage all the agents
that you have created,

1442
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,754
I was wondering if something like that

1443
00:58:48,754 --> 00:58:51,330
also exists for the IDE.

1444
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:54,870
- [Brian] Yeah, I'm not aware
of anything like that, yep.

1445
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,460
- [Sean] Maybe one day if
it's not there already,

1446
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,420
'cause I'm not aware either.

1447
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,790
- Yeah.
- Alright, coming up

1448
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,470
to the last minute here,
these are the QR codes

1449
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,318
to get to all that documentation
I was talking about.

1450
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,640
So you have the Kiro CLI, the Kiro IDE,

1451
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,913
and that MCP server repository.

1452
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,990
One other thing I will
say is that I just tested

1453
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,030
the change I made, and
now I'm not able to win

1454
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,140
my TicTacToe game.

1455
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,670
So it did fix the algorithm.

1456
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,677
- [Brian] And mine worked too.

1457
00:59:18,677 --> 00:59:21,450
It was something, silly but yeah.

1458
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,040
And mine is really dumb.

1459
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,780
Like I can beat it.

1460
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,040
I did this one time,

1461
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,130
and it used what's called
the MinMax algorithm,

1462
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,270
and it was unbeatable.

1463
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,550
So you just, again, non-deterministic,

1464
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,650
you get different things
depending on the day.

1465
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,600
- [Sean] Yeah, one last quick question.

1466
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:41,030
- [Audience Member] If you have time show

1467
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,663
about the diagram MCP
server, can you the link it?

1468
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:46,050
- [Brian] Diagram MCP server?

1469
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,450
- [Sean] Well, so if you
go to that link of the MCP,

1470
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,040
I won't be able to show
it because it does,

1471
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,570
it probably takes a few minutes here.

1472
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,020
But what I would do is go to that site.

1473
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,820
There is a diagram MCP server on there.

1474
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:59,220
It's just the same JSON definition.

1475
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,657
You would put that in, and then
you literally just tell it,

1476
01:00:01,657 --> 01:00:03,750
"Generated diagram,"

1477
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:08,750
and it'll generate an AWS nice
format of diagram for you.

1478
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:09,930
- [Brian] And then last reminder,

1479
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,120
please fill out the session survey.

1480
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,460
It really, really, really helps us

1481
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,590
if you like this or even if you think

1482
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,480
something could be better,
please give us feedback.

1483
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,580
We really appreciate it.

1484
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,020
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, thanks, everyone.

1485
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,120
Have a good re:Invent.
