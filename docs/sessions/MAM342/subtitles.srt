1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,110
- Good afternoon.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,190
Welcome to this session

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,440
on how to automate code modernization

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,006
at Enterprise Scale with Agentic AI.

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,850
My name is Elio Damaggio.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm a senior manager of a product

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,560
in AWS Transform Custom.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,830
Here with me is Morgan, Morgan Lunt.

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,240
He's the senior product manager

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,060
and main partner in crime for this product

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,650
that we're gonna talk about today.

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,000
Unfortunately, Shriram wasn't able,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,675
is not able to be with us today.

14
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:29,853
He's our director. He has a
press event that could not move.

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,800
Before we get started,
how many people here

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,593
have a problem with tech
debt or modernization?

17
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,290
Okay, okay.

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,810
Well, what we're gonna talk about

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,675
is that we're gonna talk
about technical debt

20
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:50,520
in this presentation.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,410
And the challenge that we have
is actually very pervasive.

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,917
Everybody that we talk to has this issue.

23
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:01,080
Morgan is gonna talk a little bit

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,990
about how to get started
with AWS transform

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,690
and how to perform
transformations at scale,

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,870
because transforming and
modernizing a single repo

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,940
is more kind of a proof of concept

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,360
instead of actually addressing
your tech debt challenge,

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,150
which usually spans hundreds

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,583
if not thousands of repos.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,780
And after that, we're also
gonna talk about customization

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,432
because what every
customer that we talk to

33
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:34,980
has organization-specific challenges.

34
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,420
Even things that are common,
such as job upgrades,

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,770
or Python upgrades or dependency upgrades.

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,700
They tend to have specific challenges

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,870
that are unique to each organization.

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,183
Then we're gonna talk
about value and pricing.

39
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:01,560
So let's talk about technical debt.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,580
20% of IT budget is currently spent trying

41
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,060
to address technical debt.

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,780
There is a lot of resources

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,960
that would actually be
spent in innovation,

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,960
and that's actually probably
like a lower estimate.

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,090
23% of developer time is lost
because there is tech debt.

46
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,730
That is not the time that is
spent to address tech debt,

47
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,680
that is lost because you have tech debt,

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,140
dealing with all their
frameworks, dependencies,

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,848
trying to figure out what to do.

50
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,848
Accenture estimates $2.4 trillion

51
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,743
of tech debt costs per
year in the US alone.

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,343
Of course, tech debt comes in many forms.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,190
There is security and compliance risk.

54
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,020
Your end of life run times.

55
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,070
Many, many, many customers
have Lambda running

56
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,480
on end of life run times

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,736
that are gonna be
deprecated this coming year.

58
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,650
But even without Lambda,

59
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,576
you probably are still running
applications on Java 8.

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,920
There's lots of stats that many,

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,750
many customers are in that situation.

62
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,760
Similar thing for Python and nodes,

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,230
you may have vulnerable libraries,

64
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,440
things for which
vulnerabilities are are known

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,080
and they're hard to migrate from.

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,640
These are usually things that are harder

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,493
than just going in a config
file and bump up version.

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,870
There's maintenance burden.

69
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,360
You have unsupported framework

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,280
that you have to start
supporting yourself.

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,950
You may have legacy patterns
that you have to support,

72
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,670
and skill your developers
in these patterns

73
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,920
that you don't really want to use anymore.

74
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,600
There are performance limitations.

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,840
You may leave performance

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,530
and spend higher operational costs

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,180
because you're using older
versions of older libraries

78
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,670
and frameworks and things like that.

79
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,200
You may also miss out on modern features.

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,900
Finally, there's strategic misalignment.

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,327
Usually what happens is that,

82
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:09,060
as a result of merger and
acquisitions or just organically,

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,190
your different business units and teams

84
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,860
end up using different
versions of tech stacks.

85
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,833
And that is a drag on your innovation.

86
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,670
Now of course, many
companies address tech debt

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,170
in a manual way.

88
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,340
Fundamentally, they just treat it as

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,300
any other software development.

90
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,920
Their specs, their development,

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,500
you track them in your issue tracker

92
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,526
and you just go at it.

93
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:43,620
There are ways to make things better

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,360
and to try to automate.

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,270
The existing approaches
are rule-based automation.

96
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,300
Think about ASD grab
open AI tools like that.

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,600
They usually require
specialized expertise to run.

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,042
They tend to be brittle and inflexible.

99
00:04:57,042 --> 00:05:02,042
You have a rule-based code
modification recipe or rule,

100
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,700
and that works for that specific case.

101
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,440
And if things are different,

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,790
there's usually a lot of cleanup

103
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,200
that has to happen after that.

104
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,044
There's usually a lot of startup cost

105
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:15,450
and it's really hard to
customize them for your case.

106
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,550
They also have a much more limited scope.

107
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,230
There's only so much thing that you can do

108
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,610
with deterministic rules.

109
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,040
In the end, you're
basically writing a program

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,510
that modifies a program in
abstract, really, really hard.

111
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,970
There are general purpose coding AI

112
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,070
and there's many of them.

113
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,970
These are usually focused
on an interactive execution.

114
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,650
There's a developer that's using them.

115
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,990
It's an assistant, great acceleration.

116
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,700
They're great products.

117
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,060
They're however less suited
for autonomous execution.

118
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,394
And in the end, we do not want
your developers spending time

119
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:50,370
to do this kind of modernization.

120
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,813
You want to automate it.

121
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,640
There's also no easy way to
organize reusable knowledge.

122
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,470
Usually what happens
with this modernization,

123
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,203
they affect multiple
teams in a similar way

124
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:05,010
and with the general purpose coding agent,

125
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,587
every team has to organize the knowledge

126
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,810
to do the modernization by themselves,

127
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,780
and there's no way to share the learnings

128
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,610
across these teams.

129
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,140
Now what we really want is

130
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,820
that we want a low barrier to entry.

131
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,130
We want a tool that's
designed for automation.

132
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,514
We want to be able to learn once

133
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:28,140
and use in every situation
where that transformation

134
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,810
or modernization challenge happens.

135
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,560
And we want the tool to be
able to improve continually.

136
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,730
So let's look a little

137
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,300
at some of the transformation challenges

138
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,500
that our customer had.

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,784
We've had our product in beta
since April of this year,

140
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:48,336
and we work with many customers internally

141
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:51,690
and externally to tweak our product

142
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,214
and make sure that we could provide value.

143
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:59,214
Air Canada here had a
problem with Lambda upgrades.

144
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,434
Node.js 16 was basically
coming end of life

145
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:07,320
and they had very tight
security deadlines,

146
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,940
to make sure that they got off of that.

147
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,750
They also wanted to migrate
to Graviton instead of X 86.

148
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,544
Internally, our friends at Twitch,

149
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:21,544
they were still running on
a AWS SDK v1 on their repos.

150
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,680
They had more than 900
repos running on it.

151
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,260
There was an enormous task

152
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,344
to basically upgrade
across all of these repos.

153
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:34,214
QAD is a manufacturing company.

154
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:37,786
They wanted to migrate
all of their customers

155
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,440
with each own, with their custom plugin

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,980
with their previous platform
to their new platform.

157
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,205
So they wanted to translate

158
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:50,205
their very specific progress
plugin into their new DSL.

159
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,710
This is a very complex
modernization project

160
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,620
and definitely very organization-specific.

161
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,140
We also work with MongoDB
that is working on how

162
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,230
to help their customers
migrate off of older versions

163
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,953
of the MongoDB SDK and
adopt new functionalities.

164
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,950
Let's take a step back.

165
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,800
In May, we GA'd AWS transform

166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,160
and supporting modernization
workloads specifically

167
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,170
for VMware migrations,

168
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,870
full stack Windows
modernization and mainframe.

169
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,193
Yesterday we launched
AWS Transform Custom.

170
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,595
This is a product that allows you

171
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,890
to transform any code pattern.

172
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,370
It has built-in transformations
or you can create your own.

173
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,100
It supports diverse scenarios
like version upgrades

174
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,000
and runtime up to
language transformations.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,730
It does have continual
learning and improves,

176
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,730
and it scales transformations
to enterprise wide scale.

177
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:56,160
What are the main components
of AWS Transform Custom?

178
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
You can define transformations
with natural language.

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,206
You do not need specialized expertise.

180
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,220
You have natural language prompts.

181
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,260
You can provide code samples
of what you want to do,

182
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,830
migration guides, documentations,
whatever you have.

183
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,780
Then you can execute them at scale,

184
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,980
either through a command line,

185
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,980
interactive or integrated
in your CI/CD pipelines.

186
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,100
We support multiple ways

187
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,860
to integrate it into your own flows,

188
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,540
using your own environments.

189
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,250
And of course it enables
campaigns across multiple repos.

190
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,260
Finally, and very importantly,

191
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,600
it learns from developer feedback.

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,187
So when your developers
are modernizing your repos

193
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,130
and they provide feedback to the agent,

194
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,410
that feedback is captured and reused

195
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,600
for the different executions.

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,660
Not only that, also the agent learns

197
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,550
by applying the same transformation over

198
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,260
and over on your repos.

199
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,680
So if it tries an avenue of transformation

200
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,635
and finds out that test doesn't work

201
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:07,500
and doesn't work out, it will
not try that again later.

202
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,230
Of course, all of this
learning can be controlled

203
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,270
and access controlled

204
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,743
and the idea is that you can
define a transformation once

205
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:18,750
and reuse it across many, many teams

206
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,910
and many repos.

207
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,910
That is different than just
reusing a migration guide,

208
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,403
or every team interactively
using coding agents.

209
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,050
We also provide
AWS-managed transformations

210
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,090
for very common scenarios.

211
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,910
Java runtime upgrade,
Python runtime upgrade,

212
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,750
node runtime upgrades, AWS-SDK upgrades.

213
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,970
And we also have a few
of early access ones,

214
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,690
tech debt analysis and
x86 to Graviton for Java.

215
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,760
These transformations are zero set up.

216
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,232
We validate them on very,
very wide benchmark suites

217
00:10:57,232 --> 00:11:00,933
and we're continuously growing
the number of transformations

218
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,493
that we provide natively.

219
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,312
We also, and importantly,
allow you to build your own

220
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,660
the common use cases where
we see this being very,

221
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
very useful are API and service migration,

222
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,013
of course, language upgrades for things

223
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:17,130
that we don't support, framework upgrades,

224
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,580
code refactoring, custom
patterns and things like that.

225
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,515
The idea here is that you can create,

226
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:27,600
you can instruct the agent
to execute the patterns

227
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,450
that are unique to your organization.

228
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,950
At the end of the beta,

229
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,805
Air Canada was able to
achieve 90% efficacy rate

230
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:42,805
for the conversion of
thousands of Lambda code bases

231
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:47,190
and 80% reduction in
expected time and cost.

232
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,190
And they're basically
are making this product

233
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,524
part of their operational,

234
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:54,933
part of their internal standard.

235
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,410
QAD was able to enable projects

236
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,120
that would take two week into projects

237
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,650
that took just three days,

238
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,590
achieving 60% to 70% production gains,

239
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,590
and saving an estimated 7,500
developer hours annually.

240
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,730
This is to convert all of their customers

241
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,830
to their new platform.

242
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,540
Twitch achieved the 70% acceleration

243
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,608
on each application migration.

244
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:30,390
For 913 repos they're projecting savings

245
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,823
of nearly 11 developer years.

246
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,910
Finally, MongoDB was able
to demonstrate a big impact

247
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,850
in modernizing and
migrating Java applications,

248
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,000
specifically for the MongoDB APIs.

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,550
Now, I'm gonna give it to Morgan

250
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,410
to tell you how you can get started

251
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,800
with AWS Transform custom right away.

252
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,633
- Thanks Elio.

253
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,670
So the team that built Transform Custom

254
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,810
was very deeply involved

255
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,580
in the initial AWS transform release

256
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,900
and in the release of Q developer.

257
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,720
And we learned some lessons along the way.

258
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,890
One thing we learned was

259
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,690
that onboarding on those services

260
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,220
was harder than it had to be.

261
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,650
So some of them required
Identity Center set up

262
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,888
in connection of your federated
identity provider to AWS,

263
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:16,410
which had all sorts of security approvals

264
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,060
that would need to go through.

265
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,580
You can get started with
builder ID for Q developer,

266
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,570
but then there wasn't a good way

267
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,052
to graduate up to an
enterprise subscription.

268
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,810
So we tried to do away with all of that

269
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,910
as much as we could with Transform custom

270
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,140
and really cut to the bone,

271
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,510
the bare minimum needed
to set this thing up.

272
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,640
So there is no human identity.

273
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
It's all I am permissions,

274
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,640
just like any other AWS service,

275
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,170
meant to be machine-driven.

276
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,820
Of course humans can use it as well.

277
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,270
And I'll show you how to
set that up in a moment.

278
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,420
Standard AWS infrastructure,
security, access control,

279
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,680
stuff that you already know how to use.

280
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,050
We're not trying to
reinvent the wheel here.

281
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,340
The setup is quick and easy

282
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,420
and I'll show it to you in a sec.

283
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,640
It's like literally a
one-line batch script

284
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,250
to pull down our installation
script and execute it.

285
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,080
And then you configure your permissions

286
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,196
just like you do with the AWS CLI

287
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:06,180
It's worked with your build system,

288
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,680
with your existing tools.

289
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,000
The transformation execution

290
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,710
is happening locally on your device.

291
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,790
So you don't have to like try

292
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,680
and recreate your
complex build environment

293
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,300
in the cloud if, like,

294
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,381
some other services would have you do.

295
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:20,220
And it's super easy to compose this

296
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,680
as a part of your broader
modernization workflow.

297
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,630
So you can write a script

298
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,430
to pull down your code
from wherever it is,

299
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,600
execute transformation,

300
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,670
push it wherever it needs
to go, wherever you want.

301
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,590
It's meant to be composable, flexible,

302
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,470
an engine that you can stake

303
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,820
and put in the car that
you're trying to drive.

304
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,751
So I said it's easy to install.

305
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:42,270
That's it, that's the command.

306
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,830
You can go find it on our docs page

307
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,100
that pulls down the package,
executes it, installs it.

308
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,180
We have two dependencies.

309
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,591
You need to have no JS installed

310
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,000
and you need to have get installed,

311
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,833
and that's about it.

312
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:56,490
And it works on Linux, Mac OS
and on Windows through WSL.

313
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,110
No native Windows supported this time,

314
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,110
we're working on it.

315
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:05,100
So this command line has
human interactive mode

316
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
as well as a machine drivable mode.

317
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,870
So in human mode you have a
friendly conversational agent

318
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,220
that asks you, "Hey, what is it that

319
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,930
that you want to transform?"

320
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,010
It'll query our registry

321
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,630
to find is there an
existing transformation

322
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,190
that does this or am I gonna help the user

323
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,817
to build a new one?

324
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,260
And it has all of our best
practices encoded in it.

325
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,150
So when you're trying to
create a new transformation,

326
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,430
you don't really know what
you need to provide the agent.

327
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,320
Like you wanna go from API A to API B,

328
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,700
the agent's gonna extract from you.

329
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,530
Like, well, if you have documentation

330
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,030
for those APIs, that would be helpful.

331
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,530
Or if you have a migration guide,

332
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,444
maybe you wrote for human users,
that would be helpful too.

333
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:40,200
Based on our, our several
months of beta we've run here,

334
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,023
we've come to some really
crystallized best practices

335
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:45,933
and we put that right to
guide you the right way.

336
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,957
As I mentioned, the command line

337
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,790
can be also driven machine mode

338
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,440
with a totally deterministic syntax.

339
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,990
So you put all the arguments
up front and you hit go,

340
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,850
and it's gonna execute
your transformation.

341
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,600
No human involvement needed at all.

342
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,950
The benefits to this
is it's quick to start,

343
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,480
it's quick to start getting feedback.

344
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,538
It's quick to figure out if
this is gonna work for you.

345
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:07,534
And ideally, if it doesn't right away,

346
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,780
transform custom, right?

347
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,100
It's meant for you to tweak it,

348
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,570
for you to add your own customizations.

349
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,880
If you've got
organization-specific requirements

350
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,140
or libraries or dependencies

351
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,630
or coding conventions, you
can teach it to this thing

352
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,630
and it'll remember it and use
it as it transforms your code.

353
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,270
So as Elio mentioned,

354
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,100
we have some out of
the box transformations

355
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,690
that we give you.

356
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,817
Java, python, node runtime upgrades,

357
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:33,360
AWS SD upgrades for
those languages as well.

358
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,370
Tech debt analysis, which
I think is super cool,

359
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,890
that's something we got
squeezed in at the last minute.

360
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,880
Basically it does like

361
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,880
a complete thorough
documentation of your code.

362
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,170
All of the relationships

363
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,550
between the various functions in there,

364
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,920
data flow diagrams, entity relationships.

365
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,830
Think of it like the most
comprehensive code documentation

366
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,170
you could imagine is what
we try to generate there.

367
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,186
And then we use that
information to distill out

368
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:56,790
an analysis of tech debt and suggestions

369
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,650
for things you may want to modernize.

370
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,610
There may be libraries in there

371
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,230
that you didn't know how to (indistinct),

372
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,120
or you didn't know were deprecated

373
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,890
and we try to surface that to you.

374
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,840
Now that's early access.
It's not perfect yet.

375
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,490
We're still working on it,
but we're comfortable enough

376
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,390
to give it to y'all to try
out Java x86 to Traviton.

377
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,040
We're seeing really good success

378
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,930
on our benchmarks internally on that.

379
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,890
That one's hopefully gonna

380
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,270
leave early access relatively soon

381
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,428
once we have a little more data.

382
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:23,400
And of course if you have
to do something beyond this

383
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,461
or in conjunction with
these transformations,

384
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,870
you can build your own,
you can upgrade your Java

385
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,090
and you can replace
library A with library B

386
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,250
or you know, you can stick
these things together

387
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,170
and mix and match to solve the problem

388
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,920
that you're really trying to solve.

389
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:40,890
- [Attendee] Is there a setup
for providing transformations?

390
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,380
- So there is not an official
community thing set up yet.

391
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,762
It's something we've really talked about.

392
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,240
And when we talk about
transformation definition portability

393
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,110
in a minute we'll come to that.

394
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,780
But one of our tenets
is you spend the time

395
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,850
and effort to build a
custom transformation.

396
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,028
And as far as I'm concerned, that's yours.

397
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,650
You can keep it secret, you
can share it with the world,

398
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,000
you can, that's up to you.

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,965
And we try to make these things import

400
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,543
and exportable as we can.

401
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,123
So, let's see how easy
it is to get started.

402
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,503
Oh, do I?

403
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:13,920
- [Staff] Just press.

404
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,030
- Ah, look at that.

405
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,250
So what you see here is
I put that command in.

406
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,357
I run it, it's installed. That's it.

407
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,370
And now I hit, type ATX,

408
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,810
which is the three-letter
command to kick this thing off.

409
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,840
There's the help menu and
there's our cool askie

410
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,140
art that, that I designed.

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,833
So I'm telling the agent,

412
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,910
"Hey, I want to create
a new transformation."

413
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,970
I wanna upgrade my, what am
I doing here, Python repos?

414
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,335
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

415
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,480
And it's gonna search through our registry

416
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,950
and it's gonna say, Hey,
it looks like there's

417
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,960
an existing transformation built by AWS

418
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,180
out of the box already to do this.

419
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,980
You want to, you wanna use that one?

420
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,110
And I'll say, sure. 'Cause
it's a totally agentic chat.

421
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,253
You just talk to it.

422
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,210
So it's doing some
prerequisite checking here,

423
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,860
making sure GET is initialized on the repo

424
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,840
that I pointed it to.

425
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,070
And finally it's gonna ask me

426
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,350
if I have any special requests.

427
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,183
Like you're at a restaurant

428
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,660
and they're like, Hey, you
know you want the burger,

429
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,920
but do you want onions?

430
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,300
Do you want, you can give it

431
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,920
your extra little special request here,

432
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,210
which it's going to incorporate

433
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,300
during this particular
transformation execution.

434
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,120
And it's off, it's running,
it's doing its thing.

435
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,730
It'll take, you know, 10, 20 minutes

436
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,660
depends on the size of the code,

437
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,460
size of the code base and stuff.

438
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,050
But that's how easy it is to get started,

439
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,540
to install the CLI, to
point it to an existing repo

440
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,940
you have on disc and just
start transforming it.

441
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,630
Scaling up.

442
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,010
So, okay, pretty cool.

443
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,090
I can transform one repo,

444
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,190
but I've got 500 repos
I need to transform.

445
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,243
How do I do that?

446
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,700
So based on our beta experiences
with our customers so far,

447
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,300
we found certain patterns
that seem to work well,

448
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,540
that kind of map to different people

449
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,210
with different jobs within
a large organization.

450
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,220
So first thing you want to do is plan,

451
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,590
figure out, what do you want to transform?

452
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,090
Do you want to upgrade your Java runtime?

453
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,790
Do you wanna migrate from Dropbox to box,

454
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,320
'cause your company signed a new deal?

455
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,150
Did you acquire another business?

456
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,540
And they use, you know, some API provider

457
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,550
and you have a different one
that you use as a standard

458
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,380
and you wanna migrate
their code to use that?

459
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,260
Figure out what it is that
you're trying to transform.

460
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,520
And then you're gonna identify

461
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,560
some representative targets to start with.

462
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,410
So a code base that's not
too simple, not too complex,

463
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,660
something that you feel
like kind of hits the mark

464
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,032
of a good representation of all

465
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,718
of the other code bases
you're gonna have to transform

466
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,603
that are facing the same problem.

467
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,270
And then you try it, you sit down

468
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,070
with our agent like I just showed you.

469
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,840
It tells, it asks you, "What
do you want to transform?"

470
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,370
You tell 'em, "I wanna
go from blah to blah,"

471
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,230
here's some documentation,
here's a how to guide

472
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,589
I wrote for human users,
here's a blog post,

473
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,850
here's the, you know, you
can really feed it any text

474
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,106
that should be helpful.

475
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:57,467
Code diffs, if you've done
it before in a few repos,

476
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,940
those are really helpful to actually show,

477
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,460
not tell the agent what
you're trying to do.

478
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,160
So you do this, you create
your initial transformation.

479
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,993
And you'll notice here,

480
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:07,890
this is done by a centralized team.

481
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,600
So one pattern that we found works well,

482
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,920
especially at large companies,

483
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,250
is when there is a kind
of a core central team

484
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,840
in the organization who's responsible

485
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,910
for coding standards and conventions

486
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,270
and practices, they tend to be the ones

487
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,250
who go about creating
these transformations

488
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,660
so they can disseminate them out

489
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,100
to the application owner teams

490
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,260
who are actually going to run them.

491
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,180
So after you've created
your initial transformation,

492
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,635
start a pilot, do it with tens of apps

493
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,740
and you'll start to
collect some data on like,

494
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,810
okay, how long does this take to run?

495
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,833
How good is it? Does it
hit, you know, 70% efficacy?

496
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,214
Does it hit 95% efficacy?

497
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:42,930
Just depending on the complexity

498
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,724
of what you're trying to do with it.

499
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:46,680
And you can also get a really good idea of

500
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,060
what it's going to cost here.

501
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,520
So Elio is gonna talk about
pricing in a little bit,

502
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,560
but it's purely pay as you go.

503
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,750
Totally usage-based, no
subscription stuff at all.

504
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,150
So, and it's based on how
much the agent is working.

505
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,580
So a more complex
transformation agent works more,

506
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,080
it's gonna cost a little more.

507
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,320
So through the pilot pays,
you'll collect data on that

508
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,420
and you'll be able to budget,
okay, to do this campaign,

509
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,970
it's it's gonna cost us
roughly this much money.

510
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,740
And then you can start to scale it out.

511
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,840
So I'll talk in a minute
about the push modality

512
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,079
and the pull modality, which
are the two different ways

513
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,579
of doing these sorts of
campaigns that we've seen.

514
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,270
You integrate it with your source control

515
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,110
if you would like to,

516
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,690
and you can monitor and
make sure the progress

517
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,160
is going as you would like.

518
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,650
And then the most exciting
part about all this,

519
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,450
in my opinion, is the learning.

520
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,157
So every time a transformation executes,

521
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,460
our agent goes and checks all of its work,

522
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,440
looks at everything that it did,

523
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,760
and identifies knowledge items,

524
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,380
things that it wishes
it knew at the beginning

525
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,780
of the transformation
that'll make it faster,

526
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,650
better, do what the human
actually intended for it to do.

527
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,330
And it's gonna incorporate
that information

528
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,413
next time it runs.

529
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,880
The benefits of doing this
in a centralized approach,

530
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,290
like we're talking about here,

531
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,390
is that you only have to put in the effort

532
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,205
of defining this transformation one time.

533
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,172
The quality is gonna be consistent.

534
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,870
Everyone across your organization

535
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,020
is gonna have the same
thing done in the same way.

536
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,740
Like, if I were to write a
wiki page telling everyone

537
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,210
in my company, Hey, we're migrating off

538
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,380
this old ticketing API,

539
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,999
you need to use this new ticketing API,

540
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:17,527
and I send that to a bunch
of application owner teams.

541
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:21,210
A, getting them to do it,
it's gonna be hard unless,

542
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,770
you know there's a top- down mandate.

543
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,020
But B, there's a decent chance

544
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,179
just because humans are humans,

545
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,780
everyone's gonna interpret the words

546
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,980
in that wiki a little differently,

547
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,780
even if I try to be
really explicit with it.

548
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,370
And they may follow different conventions

549
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,690
and do things differently.

550
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,520
With a centralized transformation approach

551
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,770
where you define once
and you run many times,

552
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,630
you can be confident it's
gonna be done roughly

553
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,863
the same way each time.

554
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,340
And finally, we break down
those knowledge silos.

555
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,320
So if you have a bunch
of individual developers

556
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,970
and a bunch of individual
application teams

557
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,990
that live in different cities

558
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,150
and don't talk to each other a whole lot

559
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,663
as they make discoveries about,

560
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:54,990
hey, you know, if I use this function,

561
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,130
I could save a lot of work.

562
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,750
And if I use this one, you know,

563
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,612
there's a bunch of
problems and it's annoying

564
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,400
that information today is
gonna be kind of siloed.

565
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,260
But if you do this centralized approach

566
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,820
with the centralized
transformation definition,

567
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,290
these learnings are upstreamed

568
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,610
and they're shared with everyone

569
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,310
and it saves everyone some effort.

570
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,940
So push campaigns versus pull campaigns.

571
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,620
The way I think of a push campaign

572
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,090
is you have this centralized team,

573
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,470
they defined the transformation,

574
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,580
maybe they got to a really good efficacy,

575
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,754
you know, 80-90%.

576
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,307
They're very confident that
this thing works rather well.

577
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:29,100
They can directly pull down code

578
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,040
that needs to be
transformed, transform it,

579
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,460
and then push a PR to the
application owning-team to review.

580
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,750
This way you're putting less work

581
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,920
on the application-owning team.

582
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,940
They don't actually even have

583
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,190
to install the CLI or or do anything.

584
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,290
They just have a poll request
that they need to go review

585
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,934
and make sure it does
what needs to be done.

586
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,820
This is especially useful for things

587
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,530
with high efficacy.

588
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,960
For things that are a little
more complex or trickier

589
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,850
or you just wanna give the
application-owning team

590
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,510
a little more ownership over,
you can do a poll campaign

591
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,860
where you have a centralized team

592
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,226
still create that consistent
transformation definition

593
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:04,614
and instruct the individual
application-owning teams,

594
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:06,186
"Hey, we're running a campaign

595
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:08,880
to go from blah to
blah, you have to do it.

596
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,960
The deadline is this."

597
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,474
So and so important person
says you gotta do it,

598
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:14,332
but instead of doing it manually,

599
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:17,010
here's a command you can just
plug into your command line

600
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,674
after you install the ATX CLI

601
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:20,280
and run in on your code base.

602
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,870
And it should get you
most of the way there.

603
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,790
It should take most of
this work off of you.

604
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,980
In our experience internally in Amazon,

605
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,270
this has really helped accelerate

606
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,620
internal migration projects

607
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,600
because there's something to be said

608
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,300
for the human nature of,
hey, do something for me,

609
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,691
versus, hey, do something for me

610
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,180
and here's something I made,

611
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,330
I put time and effort
in to help you do it.

612
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,595
So best practice number
one: pilots, pilots, pilots.

613
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:44,730
You're not gonna know

614
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,400
how well your transformation
works unless you test it.

615
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,779
You're not gonna know
how much it's gonna cost

616
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,160
unless you test it.

617
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,840
You're not gonna find the edge cases

618
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,330
and weird little bugs
and strange behaviors

619
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,621
that your users may run
into unless you attest it.

620
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,910
So highly recommend taking some time,

621
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,290
you know, maybe a couple of days

622
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,570
to create your initial
transformation definition.

623
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,675
Find some really good
immediate representative repos

624
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:08,231
and run it on those first.

625
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:11,610
Then refine it, tweak
it, fix those edge cases.

626
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,128
Add, you know, exceptions when needed.

627
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:16,770
You may need to decompose a
really complex transformation

628
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,030
into multiple steps.

629
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,231
That's perfectly okay.

630
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:21,570
We have, I've seen customers use a pattern

631
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,330
where they use our CLI syntax

632
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,619
to invoke one transformation

633
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,854
and then immediately invoke
another one right after,

634
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:31,500
kind of just as easy as one
transformation for a user,

635
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,756
but for the agent, sometimes
it makes things better

636
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,300
if you give it smaller chunks of problem

637
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,503
to focus on at a time.

638
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,070
Learning items, knowledge
items which are discovered

639
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,250
during execution are not
automatically enabled by default.

640
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,470
That's to prevent any sort
of malicious knowledge item

641
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,520
being discovered and
applied to code unwittingly.

642
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,720
So the centralized team
that owns the transformation

643
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,280
is always gonna be able
to take a look at those

644
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,050
and say, okay, the agent thinks

645
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,640
it discovered something smart here

646
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,660
and it's actually not smart.

647
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,210
Let me not not enable that one.

648
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,820
Yeah, and you can measure time and cost

649
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,030
and you can put together
your automation mechanisms

650
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,100
for using this within your organization.

651
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,200
However, you all store
code and do code reviews

652
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,640
and it can slot into that.

653
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,173
It's a really bare bones,
easily build-on-top-of-able CLI.

654
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,850
Script and automation integration.

655
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,290
I touched on most of this already,

656
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,720
but here's an example of how
simple the syntax can be.

657
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,595
I mean, get clone the repo, ATX exec.

658
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:29,940
N, N is the name of the transformation

659
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,181
that's stored in your registry.

660
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:33,039
That's been shared across your company.

661
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,782
C is the build command,
which is optional sometimes

662
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:37,290
for like Python and stuff,

663
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,330
people use like a linter
or something for that.

664
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,387
It's just a way to tell the agent,

665
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:41,670
"Hey, here's how you check your work."

666
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,576
Like if you run this,

667
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,460
make sure you don't get a thousand errors.

668
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,031
If you did, you probably
did something wrong.

669
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:48,883
X is non-interactive mode.

670
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,150
So saying don't wait for human input.

671
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,210
Just, you know, go,
sometimes I call it YOLO mode

672
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,070
'cause it means the agent is
not gonna ask for any help.

673
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,630
It's not gonna ask for any approval,

674
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,872
it's just gonna go do the thing.

675
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:01,020
T is to trust all tools.

676
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,550
You can also configure tool permissions

677
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,510
if there's certain tools you do

678
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,230
or don't want your agent to use

679
00:28:06,212 --> 00:28:09,390
and then it'll run and then you tell it,

680
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,140
okay, push the PR somewhere
and someone will review it.

681
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,060
You can stick this in a container,

682
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,500
you can stick this in a pipeline,

683
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,680
you can stick this in an AWS batch job.

684
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,810
You can stick this on a
laptop in the basement.

685
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,370
I don't particularly care.

686
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,250
However you want to run your,
your modernization campaign

687
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,204
on whatever infrastructure
you wanna run it on,

688
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:31,290
as long as it's got,
you know, node and GET

689
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,870
and you can get your code
onto it and it's Linux-based

690
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,244
or Mac OS or WSL, you can put it there.

691
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:40,230
So we, this is intentionally
making it really flexible

692
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,680
for however you like to work.

693
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,273
What else?

694
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:46,470
Yeah, GitHub actions, GitLab, CLI,

695
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,870
all sorts of places that,
that you can put it.

696
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,510
Obviously first class
integrations would be nice

697
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,980
if we could say, Hey, this already exists

698
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,170
in the GitHub action

699
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,160
or if we had a pre-built
container we can give you

700
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,668
and say go, you know, just use this.

701
00:28:58,668 --> 00:28:59,793
We're getting there.

702
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,990
And then I just also wanted to note

703
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,880
the AWS transform web application.

704
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,970
So if you've used AWS
transform at all in the past,

705
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,400
you may be familiar with
this web application.

706
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,620
This is where our mainframe modernization,

707
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,790
our VMware migration

708
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,490
and our .net modernization
experiences live.

709
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,345
The parts of AWS transform
that shipped a few months ago,

710
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:23,700
ATX custom is mostly CLI-based,

711
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,170
but it does have some connections

712
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,620
into the web app, namely
campaign management.

713
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,980
So if you are a program
manager or a campaign manager

714
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,577
or just someone whose boss is like,

715
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:35,280
"Hey, you said you were
running this campaign,

716
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,585
like I want pretty charts
and graphs, how's it going?"

717
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,090
This is the place for that.

718
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,680
So you can set up your campaign,

719
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,970
you can see all the repos
that have been executed

720
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,477
and I think we got a
video for this one, right?

721
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:47,913
Yeah, look at that.

722
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,420
So I'm a campaign manager,
I'm a program manager.

723
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,767
I go into the web app and I tell it,

724
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:57,249
"Hey, I need to upgrade
all of my Python Lambdas."

725
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:00,093
What do I do, huh, is it playing?

726
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,973
Nope.

727
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,463
Ah, yeah, there it goes.

728
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:14,130
I wanna upgrade all my Python Lambdas.

729
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,960
The web app has full knowledge

730
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,880
of every transformation
that's in the registry.

731
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,616
So the AWS provided ones as well as ones

732
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:22,410
that people in your
organization may have created.

733
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,103
It's gonna pull down the
relevant transformation.

734
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,720
Whatever. It'll create a campaign.

735
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,790
They'll give a command
that you copy/paste,

736
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,027
you send to your developers, tell them,

737
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:36,057
"Hey, go put this in
your CLI, execute it."

738
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:37,754
And as they execute it on their repo,

739
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,830
it's going to save the
results of that execution.

740
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,590
Like did it validate, did
it succeed, did it fail?

741
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,170
And give you that
beautiful UI in the web app

742
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,480
to see all this collective
aggregated data.

743
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,936
And because it is AWS transform,

744
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:52,380
you've got the agentic chat interface.

745
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,730
You can chat with it about that data.

746
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,250
You can say, "Hey, how many
of these over the last month

747
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,050
validated how many did not?"

748
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,690
Any sort of way you wanna
slice and dice the information,

749
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,343
the agent can help you with that.

750
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,653
Customization.

751
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,480
- Thank you, Morgan.

752
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,480
So we looked at how you can
transform a single repo.

753
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,130
We looked at how you can
scale it to multiple repos.

754
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,443
What ends up happening
is that every customer

755
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:24,090
that we talk to

756
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,180
really has organization-specific
customizations

757
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,890
that have to done there.

758
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,297
This is why we called the product,

759
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:32,490
"AWS Transform Custom,"

760
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,260
even for things such as job upgrades.

761
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,510
You have your own target
versions, your own framework,

762
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,730
your own ways that you wanna do things.

763
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,730
So when you have an
AWS-managed transformation,

764
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,210
such as the ones that
come right out of the box,

765
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,840
you actually also still probably need

766
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,390
to add some additional customization,

767
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,520
things about your
organization's specific pattern,

768
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,950
internal libraries, output style.

769
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,650
You may want to have your
own validation criteria,

770
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,960
like a special integration test

771
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,090
or commands that you want the agent to run

772
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,130
to make sure that things
are working properly.

773
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,415
As an example there,

774
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:12,750
when you're doing like
a Python 3.8 - 3.11,

775
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,880
you may want to add an
internal logging framework

776
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,870
that you want to use.

777
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,720
You may want to have
specific error handling

778
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,172
that how things you want
done in your organizations.

779
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:24,766
So this customization happens once,

780
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:28,042
but then the agents
still continues to learn

781
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:30,720
your organization-specific things

782
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
every time that is executed.

783
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,780
So developers that run it interactively

784
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,250
and provide feedback,

785
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,250
or ways that basically the agent finds

786
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,210
that don't work or that do work,

787
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,160
the agent will still continue to learn.

788
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,150
Sometimes though, you
actually do need fully custom,

789
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,920
and we talked about these things.

790
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,360
There's organization frameworks.

791
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,400
Maybe you want to have
your own custom libraries

792
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,840
or proprietary patterns.

793
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,684
You have strategic migrations,

794
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:03,072
you may want to change your
authentication service,

795
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:06,270
migrating from Auth0 to
Cognito or vice versa,

796
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,860
going from Splunk to CloudWatch

797
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,740
or vice versa and doing vendor changes.

798
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,861
You may harmonize the
tech stack across merger

799
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:18,600
and acquisitions or do
architecture changes.

800
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,240
There are multiple ways we,

801
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,008
you can create custom
transformations using AWS transform.

802
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:27,960
These are like some of the
ways that we usually propose.

803
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,390
One is the prompt and refine.

804
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,130
You can start with a simple prompt.

805
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,220
The agent will ask some questions
about what you want to do.

806
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,630
And basically after you have

807
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,955
a first transformation
definition document,

808
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:42,420
you can iterate on it
depending on some samples

809
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,150
and your examples.

810
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,800
You can also start with guidelines.

811
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,290
You may have a migration
guide that's already existing.

812
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,730
If you have an internal framework,

813
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,718
you may want to provide API specifications

814
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:55,155
of the different versions

815
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:58,513
or very important,

816
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:02,730
before and after code samples
of how you want things to do.

817
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,160
Finally, you also have a way to have it,

818
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,416
like do it with me,

819
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,510
which is like a way in which you have

820
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,640
like a very simple
transformation definition

821
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,110
and you basically stop the agent

822
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,430
while it's doing it, providing feedback.

823
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,660
Very, very important is references,

824
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,097
before and after examples
and after you're done,

825
00:34:21,097 --> 00:34:22,678
the idea is that you publish

826
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:24,438
this new transformation definition

827
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,209
on your organization registry

828
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:29,850
that is associated to your AWS account.

829
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,683
That is kind of,

830
00:34:30,683 --> 00:34:33,783
it can of course be access
controlled through IM.

831
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,953
Let's look at the demo for this.

832
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,720
Okay, there we go.

833
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,720
So here, as Morgan said,
we can start ATX here.

834
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,380
It's already installed.

835
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,570
And let's say that I want
to do something custom

836
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,287
that is not available there.

837
00:34:56,287 --> 00:35:00,840
"I want to add opentelemetry tracing

838
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,840
to my node backend apps."

839
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,310
I mean, this seems to be like

840
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,800
a pretty common modernization thing.

841
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,040
You could, you may also wanna
change between those things.

842
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,480
What the system is gonna do now

843
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,180
is gonna go and look at
all the transformations

844
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,580
that are existing in my registry.

845
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,000
We have a ton, because this
is our own internal account.

846
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,306
But one of the things that I wanna show

847
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:29,700
is at the beginning is the
list of the AWS-managed ones

848
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
with the description and what they are.

849
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,810
So after that, the agent is
basically gonna say, okay,

850
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,970
there's no existing transformation

851
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,323
for adding opentelemetry.

852
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,380
It will help us create a new one.

853
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,790
And it starts asking some question

854
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,890
and say, okay, what kind
of backend do you have?

855
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,700
Are you, are you planning
to use a specific backend

856
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,740
and do you have some existing logging?

857
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,210
What I wanna say, I wanna say, okay,

858
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,389
these are like mostly express

859
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,700
and I want to use AWS X-ray

860
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,967
and do I have any existing,

861
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:09,900
if I do, I want to remove it.

862
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,403
Okay, this is also the moment
where it will basically ask,

863
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,850
do you have migration guide documentation?

864
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,930
A whole bunch

865
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,870
and an example for doing
like, before and after.

866
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,550
How do I want to do that thing?

867
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,437
For opentelemetry, what I can imagine

868
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:27,330
is that you probably want to have,

869
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,100
you may have your own specific attributes

870
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,933
that you want to put,

871
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,650
the kind of traces that you want to have,

872
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,090
and probably you want those things

873
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,670
to be consistent across all of the repos.

874
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,480
That would be the moment to
add all of those informations.

875
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,677
Now it's gonna go here

876
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:42,140
and it's gonna kind of...

877
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,950
Think for a little bit
and, okay, I talked enough

878
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,170
to give it enough time to do something.

879
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,010
This is great.

880
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,180
And he basically said, okay,

881
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,670
this is the first draft
that it came up with.

882
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,220
Add opentelemetry
tracing to such and such.

883
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,870
It has some entry criteria,

884
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,670
it has some implementation steps.

885
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,010
The idea is that this is a TD file.

886
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,470
I you usually run this inside of an ID

887
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,030
so you can basically say, okay,

888
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,250
this is my transformation definition.

889
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,380
You can open it, you
can edit the MD directly

890
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,240
and say, hey, I edited it.

891
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,070
Or you can ask to change something.

892
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,390
There's implementation steps.

893
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,190
And one of the things
that is really important

894
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,210
are the validations and exit criteria.

895
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,616
It says, okay, package.json
has all of these things.

896
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:29,040
Some of those things may require for you

897
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,500
to customize exactly
what you wanted to test.

898
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,900
You may have some integration tests.

899
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,340
You may have to provide your own way

900
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,920
to actually test x-ray

901
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,783
and integration, for instance.

902
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,980
Or maybe you want to run some
specific integration tests

903
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,480
that are specific to your org.

904
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,870
The idea is that you can look at it

905
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,210
and you can now apply
it and see what happens.

906
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,300
You can review or modify, you
can do anything like that.

907
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,920
One of the things that I already did

908
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,990
is that I used one of this,

909
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,290
one of these transformations earlier

910
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,210
to actually create,

911
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,817
to add telemetry to this node rest API

912
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,910
and I created a diff in this file here.

913
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,530
So what I'm gonna do now,

914
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,702
I'm gonna go and say, okay,

915
00:38:12,702 --> 00:38:17,702
"I want to modify the transformation

916
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,930
to use these samples as references."

917
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,850
Okay? And if the demo are with us,

918
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,980
they're basically going to say, okay,

919
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,690
this is a file.

920
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,780
I'm gonna take it, I'm
gonna add to the demo.

921
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,039
And, and basically what this is doing

922
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,000
is looking at these files
that can be multiple files,

923
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,290
could be APIs

924
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,240
and what it's doing is analyzing,

925
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,690
is creating it and ingesting
it into its own knowledge base.

926
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,490
And it's also going and updating

927
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,260
the transformation definition document

928
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,320
to include the learnings from those files.

929
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,840
Now this is, if you have
things already available,

930
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,260
you can of course run it in interactively

931
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,597
and basically saying,
"Okay, I would like to do...

932
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,770
To basically give feedback directly

933
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,940
when it's running on
a specific code base."

934
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,360
Now this is gonna create a TD,

935
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,130
I'm not gonna wait for it to finish.

936
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,140
After it's finished, you can publish it

937
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,698
and you can run it like
Morgan showed it before.

938
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,320
This can be, here is still like working,

939
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,000
it's adding summaries

940
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,890
and it's doing like a lot of other things.

941
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,193
Now let's say that I have this
thing and we wanna run it.

942
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,550
Let me (indistinct)
this thing a little bit

943
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,727
because this is gonna take some time.

944
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:49,000
Let's say that I run it on
this specific application

945
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,890
and what we see here, we see
the transformation definition.

946
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,660
It has the entry criteria

947
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,490
and it has a set of validations.

948
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,070
After I run it, what it does,

949
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,040
the system provides a validation summary

950
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,740
given all the validation
criteria that I provided.

951
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,510
So it tells me, okay, this is what I did,

952
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,860
this is what happened.

953
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,900
And the overall status was partial.

954
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,730
It wasn't able to validate everything,

955
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,427
but it tells me why.

956
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:16,440
Eight out of the ten fully passed,

957
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,240
two criteria were partially met

958
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,640
because I did not give it any information

959
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,350
on how to actually test x-ray.

960
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,840
I wanted to go and see
that things were in X-ray

961
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,170
and of course I didn't give
it any information to do it.

962
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,490
This is really important

963
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,980
if you want to automate
these things at scale

964
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,350
because one of the things
you don't want to do

965
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,270
is for agents to fail silently,

966
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,430
to basically say, okay, I did it.

967
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,830
And then you have stuff
that's not working.

968
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,650
Because then that basically
means that all of the ones

969
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,610
where it tells you

970
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,900
that are completed, you have
to go and recheck everything.

971
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,460
You want to make sure that
that validation is specified

972
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,230
as precisely as you can.

973
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,810
And that will make sure
that you can automate things

974
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,324
and really have the
savings that you can have.

975
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,460
This is the validation summary.

976
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,280
After it's done, a really nice thing,

977
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,480
we do require git in for all
of these transformations.

978
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,460
And if you go here, you see

979
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,750
that it create a different
commits in its own branch.

980
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,340
So you can have every step

981
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,450
that is in your transformation definition,

982
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,910
that is a specific plan
that is being created

983
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,430
to apply the transformation to this thing.

984
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,540
You have a different step
that is committed here

985
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,330
and you can see and review
exactly what happened.

986
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,506
So the the first thing that it does,

987
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:39,090
which by the way was in the
transformation definition,

988
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,510
was to add all the
packages, as you imagine.

989
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,790
And it created a new JavaScript file

990
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:49,790
with a tracing
configuration for AWS X-ray.

991
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,320
And this is the common file that is used

992
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,620
by all the applications.

993
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,490
Usually you probably
want to provide something

994
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,050
that is very organization-specific.

995
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,180
You wanna say what it did.

996
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,470
Then it went and said, okay,

997
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,840
these are my route handlers, data access.

998
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,550
Let's look at like data access.

999
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,581
You see here, there's a lot
of things that were added,

1000
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:10,770
from like orders create,

1001
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,220
all this green is basically
all the open telemetry spans

1002
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,770
that add the various attributes

1003
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,710
or order the user ID or the category.

1004
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,050
And all of these things
are probably things

1005
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,650
that you may take like a
first stab as it proposes,

1006
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,750
but you probably want to provide something

1007
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,150
that aligns to your own patterns

1008
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,890
and organization specific things.

1009
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,489
These are the usual
things that are specified

1010
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:37,710
in how do we want to
integrate open telemetry

1011
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,030
in our code bases?

1012
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,230
You give that to the agent,

1013
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,720
you're gonna make sure
that all of the things,

1014
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,403
all of the code bases in your organization

1015
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,910
follow the same patterns.

1016
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,853
You can also instruct it
to detect divergences.

1017
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,383
A nice thing here is that you can also,

1018
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,260
when we talk about this, okay,

1019
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,650
this added, I have my
updated transformation,

1020
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,483
I can publish it.

1021
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:11,070
One thing that is really interesting here,

1022
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:15,813
and let me actually start
a different conversation.

1023
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,690
The agent knows what are the
things that it's good at.

1024
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,673
So if I say something,

1025
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:29,757
"can you transform .NET
applications into Java?"

1026
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:32,950
This is a hard thing

1027
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,650
and the thing is that you
want the agent to know

1028
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,930
the thing that it knows how to do.

1029
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,373
It will basically tell
you that, well, okay,

1030
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,920
this is a very high
complexity transformation

1031
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,690
due to the significant differences.

1032
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,610
So you can still try to do it

1033
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,610
and it will basically tell you
what kind of things you can,

1034
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:01,680
you should think about when
you want to do those things.

1035
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,060
If you wanna separate it

1036
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,460
between extracting specifications

1037
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,110
if you want to use strangler fig,

1038
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,160
but basically it knows the
things that are easier or not.

1039
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,920
Now let's go back here

1040
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,143
and let me go back here to my PowerPoint.

1041
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:17,843
Here we go.

1042
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,750
So what we have here,

1043
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,930
that was, the opentelemetry
is a code refactoring,

1044
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,370
is one of the transformations

1045
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,760
that is one of the sweet
spots that we have.

1046
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,430
Code refactoring, library
upgrades, runtime upgrades.

1047
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,590
We've been dealing with
those kind of transformations

1048
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,880
for the last couple of
years in AWS transform.

1049
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,790
And we know that the tool
is designed to do it,

1050
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,220
but you will come up with new things.

1051
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,010
We've had customers come with us

1052
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,757
with very, very strange
things and sometimes

1053
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:52,020
they were able to to be
done very, very quickly

1054
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,670
and sometimes they data required

1055
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,153
a little bit more complex setups.

1056
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,780
How do you improve the
transformation quality?

1057
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,520
How should you think about it?

1058
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,970
The quality of the result
depends on two things.

1059
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,490
One is the complexity
of the transformation,

1060
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,710
like .NET to Java are really hard.

1061
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,177
The two different languages,
it can be even harder like,

1062
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,090
you know, a see to rust,

1063
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,070
like it can be really, really hard.

1064
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,590
The other thing is the input code base.

1065
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,690
You may have a .NET to Java app

1066
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,060
that is 800 lines of code,

1067
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,890
may be able to do it right away.

1068
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,110
But even an easy transformation,

1069
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:32,370
even a Java upgrade applied
to a 5 million lines of code

1070
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,363
code base with multiple modules
and tons of dependencies,

1071
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:37,560
it may still struggle.

1072
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,813
So we continue to validate

1073
00:45:40,813 --> 00:45:44,340
the transformations in our sweet spots.

1074
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,730
We have ton of internal
evals on internal code bases

1075
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,260
open source, and we always make sure

1076
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,510
that we improve that quality.

1077
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,710
But you still need to have
some improvement strategies

1078
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,543
and there are some of these things

1079
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:58,890
that you can do at definition time.

1080
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,980
Providing high quality
documentation and code samples.

1081
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,380
Running pilots, super important.

1082
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,503
After the pilot you'll
usually tend to have

1083
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:09,900
a lot of before and after
examples of things that you want.

1084
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,620
So the agent can really learn
a ton about those things.

1085
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,453
You also

1086
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,263
test it, continue learning in order

1087
00:46:20,263 --> 00:46:22,448
to make it work better.

1088
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:24,933
You can decompose the transformation,

1089
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:27,210
like Morgan was talking about before.

1090
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,730
For instance, if you want to
translate across languages,

1091
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,400
you can first extract specifications,

1092
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,170
then do code generation.

1093
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,790
You may decide to decompose
based on functional layers.

1094
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,230
Some of our customers said, okay,

1095
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,910
let me first migrate the data layer,

1096
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,213
then I want to migrate another layer.

1097
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:47,161
So on and so forth.

1098
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:50,070
During refinement, we talked about,

1099
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,570
we talked about the pilots.

1100
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,380
You want to understand what
kind of results you can have.

1101
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,570
And if you're seeing
that you're not getting

1102
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,590
the quality that you want,

1103
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,880
then is the moment where you
have to reevaluate and say,

1104
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,220
okay, this is a really complex transform

1105
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,433
let me decompose either the
transform or the targets.

1106
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,890
Let's talk about value and pricing.

1107
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,450
The customers that we work with

1108
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,810
in the last six months
reported three things

1109
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,430
that they were really happy about.

1110
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,240
On one hand, they were of
course the direct time savings.

1111
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
It was faster than doing things manually.

1112
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,000
It was faster than just

1113
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,430
using a general purpose coding agent.

1114
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,800
They were able to run it at scale.

1115
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,361
The other thing was, it enabled
things that they thought

1116
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:36,240
that they were deprioritizing

1117
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,430
because they were too expensive.

1118
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,830
The Twitch team was
deprioritizing doing the,

1119
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,230
doing the AWS SDK migration for this year

1120
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,540
'cause they did not want
to spend 11 dev years.

1121
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,670
It seems a lot, but fundamentally
what it says is that,

1122
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,320
okay, we're gonna work on a year

1123
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,850
for a team with the 11 people.

1124
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,760
It's possible, but it's not something

1125
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,156
they really want to do.

1126
00:47:55,156 --> 00:47:58,860
The other thing that was there
was quality and consistency.

1127
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,070
Having consistency across
all those 900 repos

1128
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,630
or in case of like Air Canada,

1129
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,180
like thousands of lambdas
was really critical.

1130
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,120
Most of these things are
driven from centralized teams

1131
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,890
and consistency is really important.

1132
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,050
They're usually in charge
to make sure that things

1133
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,810
are consistent across the code base.

1134
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,579
And of course they really
saw continual learning

1135
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:23,579
improve the quality and compounding value.

1136
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,320
How do they measure it?
There's of course efficiency.

1137
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,110
How fast you did you go,

1138
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,060
quality metrics was also important,

1139
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,490
how many things had to be reworked.

1140
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,559
When we talked about a efficacy rating,

1141
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,225
90 plus percent of code bases

1142
00:48:42,225 --> 00:48:46,380
for Air Canada did not have
to be touched by anybody.

1143
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,783
That code was reviewed
and sent to production.

1144
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,293
10% still had to be, you know, tweaked.

1145
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,704
But that is like, there's
a very big difference

1146
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:59,850
just taking a PR, testing it

1147
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,390
and just flying through your validation,

1148
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,700
versus having to tweak and understand

1149
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,140
and like figure things out.

1150
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,730
And then there's business impact.

1151
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,000
There's cost reduction, thinking
these are operating costs.

1152
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,210
You may have going to like
more modern frameworks

1153
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,470
may actually save you money.

1154
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,128
Less resource utilized, better advantages.

1155
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:24,180
Risk reduction you may have,
you are on the latest versions,

1156
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,760
more reliability, less security risks,

1157
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,770
and of course, strategic enablement.

1158
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,630
You want it to be on certain frameworks.

1159
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,893
So it's usually a reason.

1160
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,130
This is generally available,

1161
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,460
it's available in US-East 1 today

1162
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,850
and we're gonna add all the
other AWS transform regions.

1163
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,190
In Q1, we're in eight regions.

1164
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,900
We do have cross-region inference,
but they are geo related.

1165
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,084
So North America, North America, Europe

1166
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:53,370
and like things like that.

1167
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,230
The pricing is pay as you go,

1168
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,370
as Morgans was talking about,
is $0.035 per agent minute.

1169
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,203
What's an agent minute?

1170
00:50:00,203 --> 00:50:02,700
It is basically how mo...

1171
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,120
It's a notion of the amount
of work that the agent takes.

1172
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,280
You only pay for active agent work.

1173
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,090
So if the agent is
waiting for your code base

1174
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,600
to compile on your thing,
you're not paying for anything.

1175
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,370
If you're waiting idle

1176
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,050
because the user is like
waiting for something,

1177
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,668
of course you're not paying anything.

1178
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:23,520
However, multiple agents
may be collaborate

1179
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,140
to do your transformation.

1180
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:30,140
So 15 minutes of world clock time

1181
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,580
on the service side may actually result

1182
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,293
in the charge of 20.

1183
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,890
We have some examples there

1184
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,950
and that's why we suggest to run pilots

1185
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,610
on your own specific
transformations to have an idea.

1186
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,221
However, the cost is small enough

1187
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:48,480
that it should not be hard

1188
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,630
or prohibitive to try these things.

1189
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,096
You can always interrupt.

1190
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:55,593
You're in full control
of how much you spend.

1191
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,260
What we suggest you to do

1192
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,320
and what I incite you to do, guys,

1193
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,120
is that to build confidence
through progressive learning.

1194
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,520
This, it's hard to use AI

1195
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,110
to do these things autonomously.

1196
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:18,110
It's kind of a step level from
using an agent interactively.

1197
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,677
What we suggest to do and
where we seem successful

1198
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:25,200
is basically to start with
things that are simple

1199
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,070
and already provided by WS.

1200
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,860
One lower risk and high value way

1201
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,810
is to start with documentation,

1202
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,250
you can learn the workflow.

1203
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,750
You have no code changes,

1204
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,090
so there's no risk of
like messing anything up.

1205
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,310
And you can build
familiarity with the tools.

1206
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,370
You can then go on
AWS-managed transformations.

1207
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,680
Every customer we talk to have
problems with runtime upgrade

1208
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,944
and end of life, and SDK upgrades.

1209
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:56,040
This allows you to learn
the end-to-end workflow,

1210
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,410
to experience continual
learning in actions.

1211
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,300
Customize this thing, tweaking them

1212
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,961
for your own specific organization

1213
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:05,520
and you can start measuring savings

1214
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,790
and see what you can get
with this technology.

1215
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,700
You can then move on to
simple custom transformations.

1216
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,400
Think about logging,
adding open telemetry,

1217
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,880
trying to modernize things
from that perspective.

1218
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,490
In my experience, every
company that I talk to

1219
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,140
has one of those backlogs

1220
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:26,130
hidden in their issue trackers.

1221
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,080
And finally, you, you can move on

1222
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,820
to more complex custom transformations

1223
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,961
in the context of larger modernization,

1224
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:35,225
architectural changes, language changes

1225
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:36,513
and things like that.

1226
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,196
So there are some resources here you can

1227
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:47,130
learn about AWS transfer
custom on our website,

1228
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,330
there's a hands-on demo.

1229
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,847
It's super easy to get
started with the CLI.

1230
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:54,630
No complex setup needed. Runs
on your laptop, basically.

1231
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,103
Well, it ran on mine.

1232
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,540
I am really happy that you guys chose

1233
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,760
to spend your time here with us today.

1234
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,680
I'm really looking forward to see

1235
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,470
what you guys can build
with this technology

1236
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,360
and what kind of
transformations you can do.

1237
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,843
Thank you.
