1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
- Good morning, good morning everybody.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,220
Thank you for attending this session.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,810
My name's Russell Yates.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm one of the principal sales specialists

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,700
for Amazon Connect based in the UK.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,590
And it's my pleasure today to talk about

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,100
how we can transform
customer contact centers

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,580
in financial services with Amazon Connect.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,430
Today's gonna be about
split into three sections.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,870
I'm gonna give a bit of an introduction

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,360
about the financial services industry.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,010
And then I'm gonna be joined on stage

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
by Maggie Beddow, who is the
VP of operations for Zepz.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,240
And Maggie's gonna explain the journey

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,243
that Zepz have been on
for the last few years.

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,870
But let's start with a thought.

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,690
You can't do today's job
with yesterday's methods

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,970
and be in business tomorrow.

19
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,460
And I think we could
probably all think about

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,990
organizations that we do business
with in our personal life

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,660
or even in the contact center industry

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,640
who just maintain the status quo.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,250
They stay doing what they've always done.

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,120
And then competitors change
the way they did things

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,900
and they were either overtaken

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,710
or maybe some of these
businesses went out of business.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,950
So it's really important, very Amazonian,

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,450
that we always try and think
about tomorrow, innovate,

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,650
and we're gonna be
talking about that today.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,850
So let's talk about the
competitive battleground.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,870
So what's changing?

32
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,170
Historically, organizations would compete

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,100
on all the basic things, price, service.

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,830
In the financial sector,
things like the rates.

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,500
But these are just commodity items now.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,630
Everybody can pretty
much do the same rates.

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,430
Everybody can deliver the next day.

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,260
Everybody can do that.

39
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,770
So the new reality is
that customer experience

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,840
is the only sustainable advantage

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
that you can have
against your competitors.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,820
And when you think of the businesses

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,710
that you deal with on a day-to-day basis,

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,840
I think of the businesses
that I deal with.

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,000
Of course, I'm gonna say this, Amazon.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,820
Amazing customer experience,
deal with everything,

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,180
know who I am, and shape
the journeys based on that.

48
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,160
And really, that puts us in a position

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,010
where the customer experience

50
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,040
provides the competitive advantage

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,463
that we have in a very congested market.

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,250
The other thing to think of is,

53
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,260
so while your competitors are worrying

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,800
about the price or the rates,

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,640
people are expecting
digital-first experiences.

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
Historically, you had
tech-savvy millennials

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,700
who wanted everything like that.

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,440
But we've seen the reports now.

59
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,570
Across all demographics, ages,

60
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,460
everybody is looking for simple

61
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,090
and easy-to-use digital experiences.

62
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,523
And that's really where
the new battleground is.

63
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,330
Let's look at the fintech paradox.

64
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,820
So this is for, I'm talking about this

65
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,250
for financial services businesses,

66
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,930
but I know some of my other customers

67
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,450
and people from different
industries are in this room.

68
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,780
But I think all of these
are relevant as well

69
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,710
for any business in a market.

70
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,200
So scale versus quality.

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,300
So the more customers we have,

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,060
the more complexity we have to deal with.

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,730
For cost versus experience.

74
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,330
All of the management teams
are telling us to reduce cost,

75
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,800
but we've gotta give a better CSAT,

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,753
we've gotta get a better experience.

77
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,020
The innovation and the stability.

78
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,610
So let's deliver new things,

79
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,680
but don't break anything
that's already working

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,990
'cause we don't wanna upset our customers.

81
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,060
And then the global to personal.

82
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,880
We wanna speak to people
all over the world,

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,410
we want to do everything,

84
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,110
but we've gotta maintain that human touch.

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,400
So it's really difficult.

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,830
We've got all these
things pulling against us,

87
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,870
which makes it really difficult.

88
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,520
And what makes that even more difficult

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,643
is if you've got old legacy technology.

90
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,513
So let's look at the AI revolution.

91
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,490
But what we have today is
generally traditional systems.

92
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,540
We have got customers,

93
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,030
and hopefully we've got some
Amazon Connect customers

94
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,860
in this room, but I
know we will have people

95
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,620
who are using legacy on-premise systems

96
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,160
where in the IVR we
use rules-based routing

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,620
or routing for our US colleagues.

98
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,960
We've got long wait times.

99
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,820
So when you go into the system,

100
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,720
there's no personalization,
there's no prioritization.

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,310
So customers sit in long
queues waiting for agents.

102
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,960
And when the call gets to the agents,

103
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,610
these agents are probably burnt out

104
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,010
'cause they're using multiple systems,

105
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,540
they're trying to find information,

106
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,573
it's really difficult for them to do that.

107
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,200
So let's look at the AI-powered world now.

108
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,840
So what is in the AI-powered world?

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
Intelligent deflection.

110
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,250
Maybe that ability to
deflect the conversations

111
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,190
before they even reach a human agent.

112
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,040
Predictive routing or routing again.

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,030
The ability to make
decisions based on who I am

114
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,800
and create true personal journeys.

115
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,810
Think of that Amazon experience.

116
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,910
They know why I'm contacting them,

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,530
they know why I'm doing this,

118
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,800
and then routing it to the
most appropriate agent.

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,870
And then real-time insights.

120
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,470
We can't improve if each
and every interaction

121
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,570
that we deal with doesn't allow us

122
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,550
to improve on the last one.

123
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,000
So these are the things
that are in the AI world.

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,870
But here are the things
that are a bit challenging.

125
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,400
This is the promise.

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,410
Everybody's been promised,
we've heard about AI for years.

127
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,950
30 to 50% saving,

128
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,980
and I'm gonna increase
my customer satisfaction.

129
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,080
But we all know that's not the reality.

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,410
We know that people have
come and made these promises.

131
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,170
Consultants, vendors, industry experts,

132
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,370
we're just hearing about it,

133
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,160
but it's very difficult
to actually deliver.

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,040
And why is that difficult to deliver?

135
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,750
The reason why it's difficult to deliver

136
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,220
is most people are still
delivering AI projects

137
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,600
as like technology projects.

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,720
They're not thinking about the
end-to-end customer journey.

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,300
And that's really what you have to do

140
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,220
to make sure you're delivering
an exceptional experience,

141
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,010
because just dropping in a chatbot,

142
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,320
adding a bit of automation,

143
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,750
doesn't mean that the journey's
gonna be good end-to-end.

144
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,820
And that's why it makes
it really difficult.

145
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,640
We want our customers to
have a simple journey,

146
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,590
not feel like they're going through a maze

147
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,663
to get to the right person.

148
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,813
This is a sobering statistic as well.

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,390
It's all a bit doom and
gloom at the moment,

150
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,860
but it's gonna get better, don't worry.

151
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,860
70% of digital transformation
doesn't meet its goals.

152
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,880
And these are the common
features that we see.

153
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,470
Over-engineering, as I said,

154
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,240
just dropping in all
these different things,

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,550
different languages, different everything,

156
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,420
makes it really difficult
to have a seamless journey.

157
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,380
The next one being the vendor lock-in.

158
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,090
We may have agreed that we're dealing

159
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,660
with a particular bot
provider or a chat provider,

160
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,960
but without bringing that
into a single journey,

161
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,940
it's really difficult.

162
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,790
Then you've got the change
management resistance.

163
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,980
Most businesses have been operating

164
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,530
in the same way they've
always operated for years.

165
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,660
And this is probably
the most important thing

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,540
that I would ask everybody to think about.

167
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,820
You have to get top-down buy-in

168
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,800
for any significant change like this

169
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
for customer transformation.

170
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,227
Because if you don't,
there'll be people saying,

171
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:25,980
"We can't do this," or "We've
always done it like this."

172
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,140
And these are the things that
make that transformation.

173
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,260
Even though everybody's got
their best interest at heart,

174
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,783
it can be difficult to
overcome these changes.

175
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,710
But let's look at the success factors.

176
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,510
A clear vision.

177
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,370
So this is true Amazonian,

178
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,560
working backwards from our customers,

179
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,780
identifying what is gonna change

180
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,000
our overall customer experience,

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,840
and having a clear vision
and delivering against it.

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,300
Then having the right partnerships.

183
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,510
So of course we're gonna
say AWS and Amazon Connect,

184
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,800
but this is really important,

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
the ability to deliver on this vision

186
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,620
and having that across everything.

187
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,820
And then the final one
is a phased approach.

188
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,050
It's really difficult in
a business, as I said,

189
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,910
operating in multiple countries,

190
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,360
to deliver absolutely
everything all in one go.

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,780
So we talk about thinking
big, so we have that vision.

192
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,090
We start small, maybe
in a particular country

193
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,470
or particular channel,

194
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,900
and then we move fast and we accelerate.

195
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,310
And this is the way that we see

196
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,913
the most successful projects
run within our business.

197
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,920
But what does success actually look like?

198
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,740
Now I'm gonna be handing over to Maggie,

199
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,210
who's gonna talk about the journey

200
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,520
that Zepz have been on
using Amazon Connect,

201
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,400
and then we'll go back through

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,990
some of the new releases after that.

203
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,823
So Maggie.

204
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,080
- Thank you, Russell.
(audience applauds)

205
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,253
All right.

206
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,640
Hey everybody, my name is Maggie Beddow,

207
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,100
and I run operations at Zepz.

208
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,530
That includes a lot of things,

209
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,910
but fin crime operations,
payment operations,

210
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,980
customer care operations, of course,

211
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,100
and finance operations, to name a few.

212
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,010
And what is Zepz?

213
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,010
So Zepz is a fintech made up
of two mobile money brands,

214
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,710
Sendwave and WorldRemit,

215
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,260
and both of our brands have a mission

216
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,380
of empowering cross-border communities

217
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,560
through finance and technology.

218
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,560
So our apps primarily provide peer-to-peer

219
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,800
mobile money transfers at low cost

220
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,040
that are delivered quickly
and are easy to do.

221
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,870
So I was actually the first employee

222
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,880
at Sendwave over 11 years ago,

223
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,070
and in those early days,
if you guys can believe it,

224
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,440
I took all of our customer care calls

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,520
on my personal cell phone,
which got a little distracting

226
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,240
if I was at a grocery
store or in a restaurant,

227
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,170
but those were some of
the best times I've had

228
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,440
at this company because
I was able to connect

229
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,800
with our customers and learn firsthand

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,210
about the problems that they were

231
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,070
encountering with our apps.

232
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,490
So in those days, we were
making product iterations

233
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,120
pretty much daily, right,
based on these contacts

234
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,310
from our customers, and at that time,

235
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,700
we really had to treat every customer

236
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,860
like they were our only customer,

237
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,380
and that's how we were
able to get off the ground

238
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,900
in the East African communities
that we first launched in.

239
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,120
But then luckily, that
launch was successful,

240
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,930
and we began to see exponential growth.

241
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,100
That made it really challenging
to treat every customer

242
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,053
as though they were our only
customer, as you can imagine.

243
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,550
And so the remittance space at that time

244
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,430
was becoming increasingly competitive.

245
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,030
With the COVID time, we
had more digital players

246
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,890
coming into the market.

247
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,900
There's a race to the bottom with prices,

248
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,540
and so we were really
needing to figure out

249
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,840
how are we gonna differentiate
ourselves competitively,

250
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,240
right, and it became clear
to us that customer care

251
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,380
was going to be a strong
competitive differentiator for us

252
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,020
in the remittances space.

253
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,020
In 2021, Sendwave was acquired
by a UK competitor of ours

254
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,660
named WorldRemit, and then Zepz was born.

255
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,590
But as you guys can probably
guess with this merger,

256
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,280
a lot of complexity came,
and it became even harder

257
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,670
to deliver exceptional service
for all of our customers

258
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,130
across both of our brands.

259
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,290
So today, I wanna talk to you all

260
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,300
about how we face those challenges head on

261
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,230
in partnership with AWS.

262
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,260
But first, I wanna just give
you a little bit of a flavor

263
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,613
of why our business matters
with a quick intro video.

264
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,020
- [Narrator] Fair,
fast, flexible payments.

265
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,123
It's what we do and who we are, Zepz.

266
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,460
Powering two global
digital payments brands,

267
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,100
WorldRemit and Sendwave.

268
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,350
For over a decade, we've
been helping customers

269
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,460
save time and money when
sending payments across borders.

270
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,730
And in 2020, WorldRemit and Sendwave

271
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,240
jointly enabled 50 million
customer transactions,

272
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,970
sending $10 billion in payments.

273
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,360
Now, in 2021, we've become Zepz,

274
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,080
supporting fair, fast,
flexible digital payments.

275
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,900
Zepz brands, WorldRemit and Sendwave

276
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,960
offer market-leading
speed and accessibility

277
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,400
and it's our goal to provide

278
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,860
a world-class customer experience,

279
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,480
building innovative solutions

280
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,200
that offer choices to
solve customer problems.

281
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,200
By 2026, global remittances
could hit $930 billion

282
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,570
as they play an
increasingly important role

283
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,520
in the global economy.

284
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,280
Zepz is here to help make those payments

285
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,381
fair, fast, and flexible.

286
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,048
(upbeat music)

287
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,140
- Awesome.

288
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,380
So our industry has seen a lot of change

289
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,530
since Sendwave and WorldRemit launched

290
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,710
well over a decade ago.

291
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,910
Many of our original Sendwave users

292
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,190
were literally getting in their cars

293
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,550
and driving to physical pay-in locations

294
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,680
where they were going to send money home

295
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,390
to their family members

296
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,940
and often they would
have to pay large fees

297
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,390
even if they were sending
very small amounts home

298
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,470
and they wouldn't get a lot of
transparency into those fees.

299
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,090
Additionally, most of these transfers

300
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,270
could take several days to be delivered.

301
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,750
So before we merged and became Zepz,

302
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,950
both Sendwave and WorldRemit
were disrupting the status quo

303
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,150
and pioneering a digital-first approach.

304
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,370
Now those same customers that were driving

305
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,230
to the physical locations

306
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,560
can roll over in their bed
in the middle of the night

307
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,850
if there's an emergency and
send home money from their app

308
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,830
quickly, virtually instantly,

309
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,710
and then roll over and go back to bed.

310
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,853
So it's come a long way
since those early days.

311
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,610
Today, Zepz is a leader in the market.

312
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,610
We serve over 10 million
users across 130 countries.

313
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,040
We have built a robust payments network

314
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,430
with over 90 payment partners

315
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,170
and most of our transactions settle

316
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,590
within a couple of minutes, about 95%.

317
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,750
So we're well-positioned to capitalize

318
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,370
on the shift to digital

319
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,360
as the market for
international remittances

320
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,340
is projected to be a
whopping $2 trillion by 2030.

321
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,330
So this slide goes into
a little bit more detail

322
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,310
on the journey we've been on

323
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,310
to lower not only the transaction
fees for money transfers,

324
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,570
but also to bring more
transparency to these fees

325
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,220
so our customers know exactly

326
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,010
what they're going to have
to pay to send money home.

327
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,300
We've extended that
concept of transparency

328
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,780
to the status of our
customers' transactions.

329
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,300
Most of them get there very quickly,

330
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,360
but if they do not, we
have in-app trackers

331
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,210
that show our users exactly
where their money is

332
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,003
at any given moment in time.

333
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,830
And finally, we've tried
to make using our apps

334
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,720
simple and straightforward.

335
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,840
We believe that sending
money should be as easy

336
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,423
as sending a text message from your phone.

337
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,330
And all of this is because we know

338
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,750
that the about $16 billion we send

339
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,740
in transactions every year is mostly meant

340
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,620
for essential needs in
our recipient countries.

341
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,640
You guys can see some of
those needs listed here

342
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,430
like medical bills, school fees, rent,

343
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,210
groceries, utilities, child support.

344
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,420
Over 74% of our customers
are sending money home

345
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,490
for essential needs, and
that makes it very important

346
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,710
that we live up to our promises to them

347
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,290
of getting their money
where it needs to be

348
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,753
when it needs to be there.

349
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,510
And if it doesn't get there in time,

350
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,130
this is what our customer care agents

351
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,440
hear about constantly, right?

352
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,940
They are going to hear that the money

353
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,820
needs to be there urgently,
it didn't make it,

354
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,040
what happened, somebody's waiting outside

355
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,840
of a hospital to be admitted, right?

356
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,350
So it's a real challenge
for us to make sure

357
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,760
that we're able to give good answers

358
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,443
to those types of questions.

359
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,030
This is sort of an overview of many

360
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,880
of the operational
challenges that we face.

361
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,730
We operate in a complex landscape

362
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,750
with challenges, even
the emotional context

363
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,570
that I just described of somebody waiting

364
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,730
to get admitted to a hospital,

365
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,830
being very complicated for us,

366
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,630
and we need to be able to build trust

367
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,150
with our customer base that we are going

368
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,750
to be able to live up
to our promises to them.

369
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,750
So we also operate in a
highly regulated environment.

370
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,370
In the US alone, we are required

371
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,680
to have a money transmitter license

372
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,460
in literally every single state,

373
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,910
and all of the states
have different rules,

374
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,190
different policies, different procedures

375
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,990
that we need to keep up with.

376
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,140
It's a big job just to
maintain those licenses alone,

377
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,710
in addition to all of the other licenses

378
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,340
we have in some countries
across the globe.

379
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,030
We also have multi-language
needs from our customers,

380
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,830
they expect to be able to speak to us

381
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,460
in different languages with
a complex payment network

382
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,900
that I already spoke about.

383
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,050
We work not only with end payout partners

384
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,450
like banks and mobile money networks,

385
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,960
but also with many intermediary companies

386
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,360
that send to those payout methods.

387
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,310
So my teams need to be coordinating

388
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,010
across all of those partners constantly

389
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,010
to make sure there's no
disruption to services

390
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,140
if we're having an internal issue

391
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,880
or if one of our partners is
having an issue or migration.

392
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,190
And all of this is really in the context

393
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,120
of a very volatile FX
markets in some cases,

394
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,483
as well as volatile global
political environments.

395
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,630
So the broader remittance
market has provided challenges.

396
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,860
They're all listed here,

397
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,170
the digital acceleration that I spoke of

398
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,860
that really onset mostly
around the COVID times,

399
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,530
increased regulatory
scrutiny and pressure,

400
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,750
we're seeing it across
all of our regulators

401
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,430
in different countries.

402
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,390
They are bringing more scrutiny
to the mobile money space.

403
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,830
The cost pressure, right?

404
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,750
Because we are decreasing prices

405
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,040
and that's a really, really good thing.

406
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,020
It's our mission to decrease the cost

407
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,360
of sending money abroad.

408
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,470
But as we do that,

409
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,570
we need to think of other
ways to make money, right?

410
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,330
Because it's a race to
the bottom with pricing.

411
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,890
And then there's the AI revolution,

412
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,070
which is wonderful and
holds so much opportunity

413
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,500
for us to reinvent how we think

414
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,693
about operating our business.

415
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,220
So all of these challenges
paired with the complications

416
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,940
of integrating the operations
of two different brands

417
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,020
created the perfect
storm for us to weather.

418
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,400
A few years ago,

419
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,200
we had two entirely
different customer care teams

420
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,720
located in completely different places,

421
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,780
working with different CRM systems

422
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,650
and following very different policies,

423
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,260
procedures, cultural norms.

424
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,920
It was a big challenge
to start to think about

425
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,830
how we bring those two different teams

426
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,993
and all of their tooling together.

427
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,460
So enter AWS.

428
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,460
All of those challenges
were creating fertile ground

429
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,230
for us to bring in a new partner,

430
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,230
to really bring both of
our brands customer care

431
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,880
to a better place.

432
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,233
But it was a lot of work.

433
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,870
So we started with AWS in 2023.

434
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,990
And at that time, we migrated
all of our customer contacts

435
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,990
off of Zendesk and Salesforce
onto the AWS platform.

436
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,880
And then we were able
to kick it off in 2024

437
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,540
to start building novel solutions
for some of ZEP's needs.

438
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,970
That began with our email solution.

439
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,340
And then we brought AI into the mix

440
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,653
to help answer user inquiries.

441
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,400
And then we brought in what we call,

442
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,810
we did multi-language chat,

443
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,840
and then what we call
intelligent front door,

444
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,640
which is a mouthful,

445
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,990
but that essentially allowed
us to deflect customer queries

446
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,160
before they even got to an agent.

447
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,960
And we'd launched that
for both voice and chat,

448
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,810
and that was able to
save us a lot of time.

449
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,640
And you'll see in some upcoming slides

450
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,450
kind of how that affected
our contact rates as well.

451
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,790
Finally, we launched AI observability,

452
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,600
which basically allowed us
to see what users were asking

453
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,153
and how the model was responding.

454
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,260
So in 2025, we continued
to problem solve with AWS

455
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,100
to improve the quality and efficiency

456
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,160
of our call center operations.

457
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,880
One thing that was really cool

458
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,940
is that we enhanced our
multi-language support.

459
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,980
So most of our customer care agents

460
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,950
are based in the Philippines
and they speak English.

461
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,590
And what we were able to do with AWS

462
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,710
was to allow this team
to service our customers

463
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,160
speaking other languages via chat

464
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,500
by basically accepting
communications in other languages.

465
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,520
AWS translated them to English

466
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,550
so our agents could read what
the users were talking about,

467
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,860
and then they were able
to respond in English,

468
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,810
and that would be translated back

469
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,800
into the customer's native language.

470
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,190
That was really a step forward for us

471
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,160
because then we did not need to hire

472
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,920
expensive, hard-to-find language agents

473
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,370
as much as we previously
did in the Philippines.

474
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,920
So that one was really cool.

475
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,670
We also launched a few
other great time savers

476
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,800
One was case summaries.

477
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,730
So before we did the case
summary project with AWS,

478
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,360
our agents would be taking a call

479
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,160
and then manually typing in notes

480
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,840
about what happened on the call.

481
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,020
They would take a number of
minutes after each contact

482
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,480
to have to kind of relay what happened

483
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,310
so that if somebody came back to it,

484
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,560
they would be able to
understand what was going on.

485
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,600
AWS automated case summaries
for us, and that was amazing

486
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,700
because our agents now can move on

487
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,760
to taking more calls and more chats

488
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,560
instead of having to summarize the cases,

489
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,330
but we still have a great summary

490
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,970
so that the next agent who looks at a case

491
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,920
knows what's going on.

492
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,940
In a similar vein,

493
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,510
we also automated categorization of cases.

494
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,340
Another thing our team was doing manually

495
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,070
was to give a high-level category

496
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,220
to what type of contact
they were receiving,

497
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,780
if it was funds not received

498
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,720
or if it was an identity
verification issue.

499
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,030
This was time-consuming
for our agents, right,

500
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,400
because they had to look
through a whole list of things

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,370
and think about, "Uh, what
could this possibly be?"

502
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,800
So we automated that with AWS,

503
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,433
and that was a big
time-saver for us as well.

504
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
We also have, I guess,

505
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,160
really a cool AI-powered
solution to identity verification

506
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,470
that I wanna talk about quickly,

507
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,750
which we call ID and Verification,

508
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,940
and that basically allows us

509
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,570
to identity verify a customer through AI

510
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,370
before they even reach an agent,

511
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,633
so brings additional time
savings to our agents.

512
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,890
All right, so this is
the big numbers slide,

513
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,560
and you guys can see that
all of these projects

514
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,150
have had a profound impact
on our contact reduction.

515
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,290
So with this work, with AWS,

516
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,520
we saw a 51% decrease in voice contacts

517
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,290
between 2024 and 2025,

518
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,290
and with chat contacts, we
saw about a 33% decrease.

519
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,280
So if you think about that,

520
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,220
that's massive for us
operationally, right?

521
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,590
It's big cost savings for sure,

522
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,570
but it also allows our agents

523
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,750
to be able to get to our
customers more quickly

524
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,090
and more thoroughly to really work

525
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,700
on that market-differentiating
customer care

526
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,043
that we've been talking about.

527
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,340
So people often ask how we staffed

528
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,420
these projects internally,

529
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,370
and this slide just gives you a sense

530
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,890
of what our team looked like.

531
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,810
We have five people internally

532
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,050
that worked with AWS on these projects,

533
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,620
and I think a key thing
is that we really wanted

534
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,830
to have the AWS expertise in-house,

535
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,440
and so we made sure that
we had a lot of training

536
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,390
and that we built this internally

537
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,030
so that our team could
be making improvements

538
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,170
more quickly on their own

539
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,803
instead of having to hire an
intermediary to work with AWS.

540
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,170
And actually, one of these team members

541
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,340
is named Mark Russell,

542
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,460
who is a contact center architect at Zepz,

543
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,260
and we really wanted to
put in a quote from him

544
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,920
because I think he really
worked on all of these journeys

545
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,870
and I think has a perfect summary

546
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,700
of kind of the impact here.

547
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,897
So I'll read it aloud.

548
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:25,507
"Amazon Connect provides a rapid platform

549
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:29,580
"to quickly adapt to
customer and agent demands,

550
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,647
"enabling a fail-fast approach

551
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:36,397
"to deliver innovative
journeys across all channels,

552
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,240
"whether using AI or not,

553
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,150
"to deliver the best outcomes for all."

554
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,293
So that was really
poignant insight from Mark.

555
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,860
So on our end, we had many lessons learned

556
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,740
throughout all of these projects,

557
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,840
and we wanted to kind of try to lump them

558
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,690
into three big buckets

559
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,320
that hopefully will be
more widely applicable

560
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,030
for other projects.

561
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,630
So the first bucket is vision, right?

562
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,020
You need to be able to
know where you're going

563
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,390
before you figure out how to get there.

564
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,570
So lay out what success looks like,

565
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,470
what does good look like, and
then work backwards from there

566
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,130
as opposed to trying to
build a step-by-step roadmap

567
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,390
that eventually gets somewhere

568
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,280
but you don't really know where it is.

569
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,770
I think many of us probably
can relate to that, right?

570
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,910
Where we just start building

571
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,510
and we don't actually
know what our end goal is.

572
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,390
So that was something
that we really learned

573
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,470
through trial and error in this process.

574
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,070
The second one is velocity, right?

575
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,170
We wanna move with velocity

576
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,250
and be able to make decisions quickly,

577
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,760
especially if those decisions
can be reversed, right?

578
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
So we launch something,

579
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,660
we wanna see if it works with our users.

580
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,910
Okay, great, we can pull
it back if it doesn't work,

581
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,370
but we're gonna learn a lot

582
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,780
by putting it out there in the world.

583
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,090
And so let's do that
as quickly as possible

584
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,330
so we can learn as fast as possible.

585
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,700
And that's something that
we got better and better at

586
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,970
over time and we got less nervous
about just doing something

587
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,120
because we knew we could
roll back any changes

588
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,690
that were having an adverse
effect on the customer base.

589
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,820
And the final thing is automation,

590
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,010
which I suppose is an obvious one,

591
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,870
but really looking at what
are agents doing manually?

592
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,330
Like what is their day-to-day look like?

593
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,060
What things are they handling

594
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,830
that really could be automated?

595
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,020
And maybe we can't automate it today.

596
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,540
Maybe it's not the most important thing,

597
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,560
but let's have a plan to try
to automate it in the future.

598
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,050
Let's put it on the roadmap, right?

599
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,730
And that applies also to things

600
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,560
that our customers are doing, right?

601
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,630
If our customer is calling
in about something,

602
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,450
did they really have to
call in about this thing?

603
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,810
How could we enable more
self-service around it?

604
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,070
So those are the types of questions

605
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,830
that we're always trying to ask ourselves

606
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,003
day in and day out.

607
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,780
All right, so what's next?

608
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,770
As we sort of take these lessons in mind,

609
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,990
it's going to be essential
for us to keep them

610
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,050
in our operating procedures as we scale

611
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,910
and launch new product lines.

612
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,220
It's been a while since
either of our brands

613
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,630
launched a new product line.

614
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,680
We've mostly been bread and
butter remittance companies,

615
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,230
but we are launching a new
product on the Sendwave brand

616
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,180
called the Sendwave Wallet,

617
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,780
which extends our mission
of financial inclusion

618
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,140
to allow recipients to hold the equivalent

619
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,900
of US dollars in wallets,

620
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,690
and they can decide when they cash out

621
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,610
when there's a favorable FX rate,

622
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,470
and that really empowers them

623
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,750
with being able to hold a transfer in USD

624
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,180
until it's a good time for them

625
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,040
to get a good exchange rate and cash out.

626
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,410
So I wanted to give you guys
a preview of this product

627
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,090
because it's really exciting,

628
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,310
but it's, of course, also,
as with all these things,

629
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,440
going to bring more complexity

630
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,203
to how we service our customers.

631
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,390
- [Narrator] Zepz is transforming
from a remittance player

632
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,390
into a platform for financial empowerment,

633
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,870
and as we do, our customers
expand what's possible

634
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,910
in their financial lives.

635
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,750
The Sendwave Wallet breaks
the legacy remittance model.

636
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,570
The old divide with
senders in the global north

637
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,560
and recipients in the global
south no longer applies.

638
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,740
With the Sendwave Wallet, roles blur.

639
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,180
Any customer can now be a
sender, saver, and spender.

640
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,470
Money moves easily in every
direction our customers need.

641
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,050
Built directly into the Sendwave app,

642
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,990
customers can send, hold, and spend money

643
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,500
across 100-plus countries in seconds.

644
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,930
Funds are held safely in digital dollars

645
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,790
pegged to the US dollar,

646
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,670
designed to give customers
greater stability,

647
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,420
helping them support loved
ones and build for the future.

648
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,710
And the best part is, it's
already available today.

649
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,780
It all starts now.

650
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,480
Powered by trusted stablecoin technology

651
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,480
from Circle, Solana, and Portal,

652
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,010
the Sendwave Wallet is secure
and incredibly easy to use.

653
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,100
No hidden fees, no crypto jargon,

654
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,730
just seamless, real-world payments.

655
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,010
Imagine sending money to a loved one

656
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,740
and having them receive it in seconds,

657
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,320
ready to use for whatever they need.

658
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,390
That's the power of Sendwave.

659
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,450
With ZEPP's decade-long
global payout network

660
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,520
backing the Sendwave Wallet,

661
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,830
customers can easily withdraw funds

662
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,510
through trusted partners,

663
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,170
use their balance for real-world
payments and services,

664
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,050
going beyond traditional remittances.

665
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,090
It's more than just sending money.

666
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,820
It's about financial
empowerment, stability,

667
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,090
and dignity for Sendwave customers,

668
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,620
because every cross-border
payment is also an act of love,

669
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,100
a way to support families,
build opportunities,

670
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,053
and shape a better future.

671
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,830
- And so as we think about
kind of our next phase in 2026,

672
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,020
with the Sendwave Wallet coming into play

673
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,900
and, of course, our existing
remittance business,

674
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,610
what do we have planned?

675
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,160
And I wanna go over just a few things

676
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,110
before I hand it back to Russell.

677
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,540
The first is to improve our
automated customer surveys

678
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,460
so that we're able to
improve our AI content

679
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,500
on the back end of that.

680
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,180
The second is voice AI assistance
to offer 24/7 help, right?

681
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,970
Typically, we have to
have specific office hours

682
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,680
for our customer care staff,

683
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,000
because it's too complicated
to offer 24/7 service

684
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,980
with real humans.

685
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,610
And the last is live
voice-to-voice agent translation,

686
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,400
which you can think of
similarly to that chat feature

687
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,320
that I was talking about.

688
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,310
So this is the stuff
that's on deck in 2026,

689
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,516
and now I will hand it back to Russell.

690
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:23,599
(audience applauds)

691
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,470
- Thanks very much, Maggie.

692
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,230
I think one of the things
that's really empowering

693
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,740
of working with Zepz has
been their commitment

694
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,170
to use all the features and functions

695
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,750
that sit within Amazon Connect.

696
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,850
When I started working with Zepz,

697
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,610
and before the slide that Maggie
showed where it was email,

698
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,220
we were just looking after voice traffic.

699
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,790
Then Zepz started using chat and tasks

700
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,820
and contact lens and evaluations.

701
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,070
And a prime example was when

702
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,230
their current workforce
management platform

703
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,600
was coming up to renewal.

704
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,940
We did a demo for them on a Friday.

705
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,500
They looked at the solution.

706
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,150
They benefited from the free trial

707
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,310
that we offer within Connect.

708
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,210
And within a week, they'd
switched off their old

709
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,750
workforce management solution,

710
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,880
and they were using Amazon Connect,

711
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,640
forecasting, capacity
planning, and scheduling.

712
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,890
And that just demonstrated the commitment

713
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,650
of the team to always be innovating,

714
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,610
always using the latest technology,

715
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,380
and being able to deliver
that for themselves.

716
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,150
A lot of customers always ask me

717
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,800
about what's the size of the team,

718
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
and that's why we asked
Maggie to present that.

719
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,540
You don't have to have big teams.

720
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,180
That's really the nirvana
of where you want to get to,

721
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,850
where you've got a mixture
of either in-house teams

722
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,150
and partners to be able
to deliver the innovation

723
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,673
quickly and efficiently
for your customers.

724
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,060
Right, let's move on now.

725
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,860
We're gonna talk about
some of the innovation

726
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,350
that many of you will have heard of

727
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,530
through the last few days

728
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,650
with the announcements
from Amazon Connect,

729
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,790
and I'm gonna touch on a few of those now.

730
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,150
But I think it's worthwhile first starting

731
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,840
with the vision of where
Amazon Connect has come from.

732
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,040
And some of you may have been

733
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,310
at the Amazon Connect
networking event last night,

734
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,770
and we were talking to Pasquale de Mayo,

735
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,320
the vice president for Amazon Connect,

736
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,907
about the journey that we started on

737
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,830
and the challenge that he'd been given

738
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,320
by Andy Jassy to grow this business.

739
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,570
And as many of you will have
seen in his presentation

740
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,150
and Matt Garmin's presentation yesterday,

741
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,390
Amazon Connect now generates
a recurring revenue

742
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,700
of over a billion dollars a year.

743
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,433
So you can imagine from 2017,

744
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,850
we started as a disruptor in this industry

745
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,220
with very basic features
and functionalities,

746
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,610
today to being recognized
as one of the leaders

747
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,980
by all the key consultants.

748
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,060
And when you think about this,

749
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,450
if you look at this across
each of the top lines,

750
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,360
so the first one being the
communications channel,

751
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,790
when we started, we had
a basic voice solution,

752
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,810
and now we have an
omni-channel agent experience

753
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,210
that provides AI to allow you to have

754
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,010
agentic AI experiences
that I'm gonna come on

755
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,930
and talk to in a little bit.

756
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,280
In the agent empowerment line,

757
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,600
we started with a basic
customer control panel.

758
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,750
Now we have a multi-agent AI platform

759
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,520
that gives assistance to
agents during conversations.

760
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,690
And then on the bottom side,

761
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,840
we just had basic historic reporting.

762
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,653
Now we have AI-driven agent evaluation,

763
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,440
forecasting capacity planning,

764
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,430
the ability to do these
things in multiple languages.

765
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,100
This is so much game-changing

766
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,990
that allows you to stay up to date

767
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,243
with what your customers are demanding.

768
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,340
And in those times,

769
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,170
we're now launching over
200 announcements each year.

770
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,970
There were 29 that we made the other day

771
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,200
when we did all the announcements,

772
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,570
but you think 200, that's four a week.

773
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,460
This is the pace of
innovation that we're doing

774
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,163
to allow you to keep
up with your customers.

775
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,780
Let's move on to this
quite complicated slide.

776
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,640
You'll have seen these
sorts of slides before

777
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,690
with all the different things,

778
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,170
but I'm gonna explain this
in a little bit more detail.

779
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,260
So Amazon Connect creates intelligent,

780
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,150
adaptive customer experience
journeys in the agentic world.

781
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,360
And we think of these experiences
in four particular ways,

782
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,040
and this is the top line here.

783
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,440
So firstly, the understanding.

784
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,840
The understanding is about comprehending

785
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,910
what customers are asking us,

786
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,890
understanding their intent
across any particular channel.

787
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,420
We've then got the reasoning.

788
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,940
What's the next best
action that we need to do

789
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,640
based on the systems
that we have internally,

790
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,090
but also what the
customer may be asking us?

791
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,850
The next thing with the
agentic world is the action.

792
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,350
We've actually gotta deliver this.

793
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,260
So if the action is to make a refund,

794
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,980
update a system, change an
address, that's part of it.

795
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,620
And then the final one being the memory.

796
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,930
We need to capture this information

797
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,000
to deliver those journeys.

798
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,010
So the next time I contact,

799
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,190
we're taking that context into it as well.

800
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,670
So those are the four main components

801
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,790
that we see in the agentic world for CX.

802
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,830
We then move down to
the intelligence layer,

803
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,600
which are the foundational levels

804
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,490
that sit within Amazon Connect.

805
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,590
So we're gonna start on the
bottom left-hand side here,

806
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,120
which is the knowledge.

807
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,040
So things like customer profiles.

808
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,210
So customer profiles, the
internal enterprise tools,

809
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,650
and systems of record that
you have within your business

810
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,893
to make these decisions.

811
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,550
Amazon Connect now services
all of our customers

812
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,260
in any channel that you look for,

813
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,900
voice, chat, email, WhatsApp,
all of the things there.

814
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,073
That's the next layer.

815
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,430
The next layer up is
the orchestration layer,

816
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,530
which is the true agentic world,

817
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,220
which is where we're looking
at AI-generated workflows

818
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,590
where we're pulling information
from various sources

819
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,380
to make intelligent decisions.

820
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,020
And then the new announcements
about the AI agents,

821
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,300
we're moving on to the
right-hand side now,

822
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,400
which is the out-of-the-box agents

823
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,650
that sit within Amazon Connect,

824
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,620
the ability to create custom applications,

825
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,070
custom agents within Amazon Connect

826
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,350
for specific use cases that you have,

827
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,850
and then probably the most exciting

828
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,440
is the third-party agents,

829
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,020
allowing organizations like yourselves

830
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,990
to make the decision and
give you ultimate flexibility

831
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,780
to use what comes out the box,

832
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,820
what you can create, and third parties.

833
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,900
And now gone are the days

834
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,340
where you've gotta just stick to one.

835
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,160
This is allowing you the
freedom and flexibility

836
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,273
to choose whatever.

837
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,650
Using analytics, we've
talked about it already,

838
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,970
conversational analytics,

839
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,370
understanding what's
happening in real time,

840
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:54,030
sentiment analysis at
each and every stage,

841
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,310
agent performance, the evaluations,

842
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,043
and then forecasting capacity
planning and scheduling.

843
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,790
And then finally, the observability.

844
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,390
None of this is of any use
if we're not tracking this,

845
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,120
as I said at the start, this
true end-to-end journey.

846
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,800
How do we make sure that we're tracking it

847
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,510
for the end-to-end journey?

848
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,620
This is also about testing and
simulating these experiences

849
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,110
because in the agentic world,
we can try these things out

850
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,560
before we fully deploy them so we can see.

851
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,200
And then the final thing
being the analytics data lake,

852
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,370
that ability to capture data

853
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,090
and then look at those end-to-end journeys

854
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,680
and see are we delivering

855
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,170
what we're saying for our customers?

856
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,260
So this now gives people
the ultimate choice.

857
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,480
Amazon Connect is in the agentic world.

858
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,327
Agentic AI sits within Amazon Connect now,

859
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:45,210
and this gives you a choice
across all the channels

860
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,270
and all the ways that you'd
want to deal with your customer

861
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,473
to allow you to deliver those
exceptional experiences.

862
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,850
And as I said, Amazon Connect
is now in the agentic world,

863
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,433
and I'm gonna focus on
two that start here.

864
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,030
Action with AI, which
is how can we automate

865
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,030
as much as possible and allowing
humans to make decisions

866
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,190
when contact gets to them?

867
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,820
And then evaluating your
workflow, workforce, sorry,

868
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,430
elevate your workforce, which
is where when you're speaking,

869
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,910
when a contact does come to a human agent

870
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,190
after it's been with an AI teammate,

871
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,113
we give them as much information.

872
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,753
So let's look at these.

873
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,390
So we're gonna talk about agents that act,

874
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,140
natural voices, and AI evaluations.

875
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,800
So Amazon Connect is now agentic,

876
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,720
and what this means is it's the ability

877
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,250
to be able to pass basic information

878
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,680
from an AI agent into the workflows,

879
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,200
things like what number they called us on,

880
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,950
what webpage they're on,
information that's gonna help us

881
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,500
deliver a better experience.

882
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,390
We can then integrate with knowledge bases

883
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,490
and various tools and collaborate

884
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,340
with those third-party agents that I said.

885
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,470
And then finally, the things that are

886
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,150
out-of-the-box AI agents,

887
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,240
and if you go to the demo
booth in the Venetian,

888
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,610
you will see now how these
are built in the workflow

889
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,050
where we can pull the
out-of-the-box AI agents

890
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,470
to do simple tasks that
we've historically done

891
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,170
with physical agents.

892
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,270
Now this can be done in the agentic world.

893
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,770
Natural voices.

894
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,200
I mean, if you've been
working with Amazon Connect

895
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,690
like I have for nearly five years now,

896
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,980
the voice quality of interactions
when they're automated

897
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,750
has a real impact on our customers

898
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,000
if they don't wanna talk to robots.

899
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,270
And now, since April when
we launched Nova Sonic,

900
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,990
we've now grown this
to allow our customers

901
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,860
to have the access, if
they're using unlimited AI,

902
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,280
to things like 11 Labs and Deepgram,

903
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,190
which allows you to have better languages,

904
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,610
better understanding,
handle interruptions better,

905
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,200
all the things that you need

906
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,460
when you're trying to create
more natural experiences.

907
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,230
And then the final one in this section

908
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:15,090
is about AI agent evaluation and insight.

909
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,970
So today, many of you will
use our evaluation tools

910
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,290
to measure and monitor
existing interactions.

911
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,450
And this should be no
different than what we do

912
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,810
with AI-generated evaluation.

913
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,460
So you can do this.

914
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,530
It measures them in the same way

915
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,810
to make sure we're giving
a consistent approach

916
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,070
across everything.

917
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,930
And then allow human
supervisors to monitor that

918
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,453
and see what's happening.

919
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,150
So let's change gears now.

920
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,700
Let's go back to Elevate, your workforce.

921
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,070
We're looking at agentic AI assistance

922
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,573
and case summarization.

923
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,610
So with agentic AI assistance,

924
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,840
this allows our agents to be helped

925
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,120
almost in a way like step-by-step guides.

926
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,380
If you've used Amazon Connect,

927
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,780
step-by-step guides
was originally launched

928
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,720
for our customers, then for
our own internal agents.

929
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,750
And now this is being able to help agents.

930
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,010
So when they're in tricky conversations,

931
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,890
it can actually do the task for them.

932
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,790
It can help them customize
these actions and behaviors

933
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,380
and guide them through these experiences.

934
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,750
Again, moving away from this burnout,

935
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,570
we're there to help our agents

936
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,263
do each and everything
in every interaction.

937
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,250
And then finally, the case summarization.

938
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,120
This is using Amazon Connect
cases and taking information,

939
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,730
summarizing this across
multiple key stage insights

940
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,770
to enable agents to update the cases,

941
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,410
summarize them and have the
sort of streamlined approach

942
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,290
that they're not spending ages

943
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,540
writing up work after the call.

944
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,100
They can move on to the next one

945
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,700
and we know that that's trusted.

946
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,740
So let's go back to the start.

947
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,290
I said to you, thinking about,

948
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,150
can you do, you can't do today's job

949
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,300
with yesterday's methods
and be in business tomorrow.

950
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,830
And what you heard from Zepz

951
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,500
and what I've talked about
with all the new releases,

952
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,970
hopefully gives you food for thought,

953
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,630
gives you the encouragement
to go and try these things

954
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,233
and encourage you to use Amazon Connect.

955
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:26,390
So there's a big program of
other talks still going on,

956
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,260
as I said, also at the Venetian,

957
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,070
the Village Booth A13 is where
we've got some live demos

958
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,010
so you can see all of
this stuff in action.

959
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,330
We've got three other sessions,

960
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,050
there are other sessions
at the MGM here as well.

961
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,393
So please join those.

962
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,860
And now we've got a few minutes left.

963
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,070
If anybody would like to ask
myself or Maggie a question

964
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,560
about anything we've discussed so far.

965
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,393
Thank you.
