1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:02,450
Hi, everybody. Thank you for your time today and

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,509
welcome to DVT 216.

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:05,509
Um,

4
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:07,929
we're thrilled that you're here with us this morning. Thank you very

5
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,169
much for coming to Reinvent. Thank you for spending the next

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:10,948
hour with us

7
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:13,630
on this, the final day, the last gong

8
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,250
of um Reinvent 2025.

9
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,129
Uh, we got it, we made it.

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,208
Well done team.

11
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,309
I hope everybody's had a truly excellent week.

12
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,818
Um, hopefully, you got to make

13
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,850
some new friends along the way, caught up, and you catch up

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,978
with some old friends. I, I hope you learned something new

15
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:30,120
and I, I, I hope you felt a little bit inspired along the way

16
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,039
cause that's certainly what

17
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,679
Reinvent feels like for me.

18
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,359
Uh, so thank you for being here. We appreciate you joining us

19
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,548
this week. So because it's

20
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,649
Friday, and we shouldn't have to put any

21
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:41,819
brain cycles into anything too taxing

22
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:42,848
today, we've decided

23
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,389
uh that today's session is only gonna be staged

24
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,658
by Paul's. That way, you can go back home

25
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:50,029
with a little bit of, um, you know, more

26
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,348
content in your head. Hopefully the content from today's session,

27
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,490
um, and you don't have to remember one more thing.

28
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:57,298
So thank you again for your time. My name is Paul Stafford. Um,

29
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:59,630
I'm part of the worldwide team that looks after

30
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,469
our customers'

31
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,840
growth and success with,

32
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:03,990
um, Quiro and Q Developer.

33
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,609
I've, I've been with AWS for 6 years

34
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,730
now. Um, and I'm based in

35
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,528
Melbourne, Australia.

36
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,010
Uh, prior to this, I've been a product director

37
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,250
and a solution architect and business development

38
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,888
manager,

39
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,209
uh, and a developer as well. Uh, in fact,

40
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,480
I, I think of myself mostly as a recovering

41
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,010
developer.

42
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,668
Uh, I cut my teeth

43
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,069
way back in the day,

44
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:25,329
building JAppy integrations between

45
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,329
carrier grade voice systems. If there are any

46
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,329
tap heads in the audience that want to reminisce about the

47
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,609
scars and the good old days,

48
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:31,879
please come find me afterwards.

49
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,028
Uh, I love chatting about that stuff.

50
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,620
Um, but I'm also thrilled to introduce

51
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,698
you to Paul Thrasher, who is the far

52
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,859
better Paul, um, the Paul with the cooler

53
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:41,959
last name certainly,

54
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,459
um, who's graciously agreed to

55
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,459
share the stage with me today.

56
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,329
Uh, thanks, Paul. Um, so

57
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,028
I'm Paul Thrasher. I'm

58
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,388
project director for Agentic Fabric

59
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,909
at IBM, uh, Hash Corp,

60
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:55,790
now IBM,

61
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,668
um,

62
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,769
and Agentic Fabric is doing,

63
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,138
uh, AI projects within Hash Corp board.

64
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,668
Um, so I started way back

65
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:05,230
in the day with, uh, a

66
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,180
Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design.

67
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,788
Been a programmer for over 16

68
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,830
years, I was doing.

69
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,258
Um, PHP at first, but I got in

70
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,240
a, you know, Python,

71
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:15,740
no JS Go,

72
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,558
Swift,

73
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,118
um, been really loving SWIFT lately.

74
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,659
Uh, I've been with Hashicourt for

75
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,659
a, a bit over 8.5 years and

76
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:24,319
got into,

77
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,960
uh, product management about

78
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,240
3 years ago.

79
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:30,610
Um, since then, I was,

80
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:31,558
uh, became

81
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,038
director of product for the,

82
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,258
our Terraform ecosystem.

83
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,889
So at first managing providers but also

84
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:38,490
doing, you know,

85
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:39,830
partner integrations,

86
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,439
um, and now, now I'm doing

87
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,409
AI for, for all of Hash Corp up here.

88
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:45,830
So, um,

89
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,649
you know, I've been all over the place

90
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,929
so I think at this, this point

91
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,050
I just like to build stuff so here

92
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,258
we are on stage building some stuff.

93
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:56,210
Awesome.

94
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:58,770
Fantastic. Thank you very much, Paul. Much appreciated.

95
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,008
So, rather than,

96
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,868
uh, I suppose, uh, show you a very sequential

97
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:06,000
agenda slide, which I'm sure you've seen enough of during

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,028
this week, uh, we thought it'd be a good idea to

99
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:10,149
give you a synopsis of what you're gonna hear and see

100
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,330
over the next 60 minutes,

101
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,629
followed by some topic specifics. And that

102
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,889
way we can effectively convey both

103
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,909
the thematics as well as the molecules

104
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:19,949
of what it is that you're gonna hear about in this

105
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,808
breakout session.

106
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:23,990
In In what is probably the,

107
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,909
in what is probably the understatement of the week,

108
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,258
I'm gonna say that agents are undergoing

109
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,330
significant transformation.

110
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,929
What used to be assistive tooling is now

111
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,588
quite sophisticated and autonomous.

112
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,929
And at its crux, that's what you're gonna hear

113
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,610
today. You're gonna hear a story of change.

114
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,088
We're gonna talk how um agents and their use

115
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,449
cases have changed. We'll talk about how the SDLC

116
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,189
is in the progress and the process of changing.

117
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,990
Uh, we'll talk about how services like Hiro have

118
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,429
changed, but most importantly, we'll also focus

119
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,740
on, um, Hashi Corp and, uh,

120
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,788
the change that they went through to solve one of their

121
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,969
most pressing challenges by using, um,

122
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,308
uh agentic AI within their SDLC.

123
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:01,219
Uh, importantly, you're also gonna see the practical

124
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,819
reality of the human agent partnership

125
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,838
in action. And it is a partnership

126
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,159
where agents have become active collaborators,

127
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,409
uh, with us, with developers in the,

128
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,838
uh, in the development process.

129
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,469
So, in creating the

130
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,750
session, Paul and I wanted to ensure that

131
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,869
uh all of the topics in the next 60 minutes

132
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,869
were underwritten with a very followable

133
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:22,829
how and what

134
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,629
format.

135
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,988
Uh, so based on a rough calculation of time and

136
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,988
slides, the next 60 minutes is gonna

137
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:29,850
be divided um thusly.

138
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,338
And as you can see, we're gonna put, put a bit more time

139
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,420
into the how slides and the how details.

140
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,750
And rightfully so, this is a level 200 session.

141
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,319
Uh, so we will cover the evolution of agents,

142
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,678
the human, um, agent partnership. We'll go into

143
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:43,519
Agentic AI across the SDLC.

144
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:44,778
We'll have some demos.

145
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,238
Um, we'll obviously talk about Hashhy Corp's

146
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,399
challenge, and then we'll talk about tooling and

147
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,660
MCP will be an element,

148
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,108
uh, of that. So if we do our job properly,

149
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,259
we'll hopefully get you thinking about not just the

150
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
technological change, but we'll also get you thinking

151
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,858
about the paradigm shift that folk are going through

152
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:02,399
as they, uh, as they, as they're approaching

153
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,509
software development in late 25 and,

154
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,939
and obviously next year as well.

155
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,769
So you'll spend roughly the next twenty-ish

156
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,160
minutes with me, um, and we'll go through that

157
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,639
contemporary evolution concept.

158
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,000
We'll talk about patterns, we'll talk about use cases,

159
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,100
we'll talk about adoption.

160
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,778
And then Paul will take the stage for the good stuff.

161
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,220
Um, Paul's gonna talk,

162
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,660
uh, through some demos that he's recorded,

163
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:25,220
and he'll talk on the reality of how this works for Hashi Corp

164
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,569
and the benefit that they've seen and drawn

165
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,738
into their own customers and their own partner,

166
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,790
partner ecosystem.

167
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,269
But if there was, if there was only one thing that you took away

168
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,569
from today, and if there was only one thing that you recalled,

169
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,730
um, in the weeks to come,

170
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,230
Paul and I would really like it to be um

171
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,470
this quote from this session.

172
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,540
Yes, AI agents can create and achieve

173
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,579
great things, but it's the human who provides

174
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,819
the contextual and tooling wisdom, the

175
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,100
strategy that prevents agents from assuming

176
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,759
in the dark.

177
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,220
Now, we'll revisit this quote later on

178
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,459
in the slide deck. We'll decompose it further once we've gathered

179
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,579
a little bit more detail through the course of the session.

180
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,750
What are AI agents? Autonomous or semi-autonomous

181
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,829
software systems that can reason, plan, and

182
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,259
act to accomplish goals in digital environments.

183
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,709
Uh, you may have seen this definition knocking

184
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,709
around on the internet recently, uh, in

185
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,750
the last couple of days. And whilst I understand its

186
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,309
intent, I'm not really a fan of it.

187
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,569
I prefer

188
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,910
an agent is a system that you give

189
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,769
agency to complete a task

190
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,439
according to independence,

191
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,009
tooling and context that you allocate.

192
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,670
These days, Agentic AI is context-aware,

193
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,100
um, it is proactive in its actions,

194
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,709
um, and it can maintain continuity over tasks.

195
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:38,899
And when you wash everything else away, it's

196
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,019
these three concepts that enables

197
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,170
us to partner effectively as humans,

198
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,379
as developers, working with the agents

199
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,428
themselves. And this is obviously, uh,

200
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,540
in all in the purpose and the intent of

201
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,619
having an intelligent collaborator in

202
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,160
our software development activities.

203
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,850
So, I thought it worthwhile putting a couple of points of definition on

204
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,858
the table right at the get-go because there is

205
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:00,959
some ambiguity around terminology

206
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
with Gen AI and agentic AI and everything

207
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,928
in between.

208
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
At AWS we think of generative AI

209
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,579
as this three-layer stack. I'm sure you've seen

210
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,079
this during the course of the week uh or maybe previously.

211
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,619
Um, at the bottom, we have,

212
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:16,040
uh, services, infrastructure services that our customers

213
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,670
use to build and train their own models.

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,079
In the middle is Amazon Bedrock, which is used

215
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,819
to create generative AI applications.

216
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,149
And then at the top is the agent-based managed

217
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,399
AI services such as Qiro and Q Developer.

218
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,928
At AWS we consider

219
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,910
AI agentic AI to be about task

220
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,449
management,

221
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,069
um, and specifically toil-based task.

222
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,428
And I'll say that word a lot during, during the next sort of 15

223
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,290
minutes, toil.

224
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,949
Um, this is where you give a large language

225
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,069
model agency to complete something

226
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,230
on your behalf because as it turns out, having an agent

227
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,879
that you can allocate an activity to,

228
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,670
uh, is a powerful productivity and efficiency

229
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,209
concept.

230
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:53,949
And part of the reason for that productivity

231
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,850
and efficiency is simplicity.

232
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,548
Because agents are actually only composed of four main

233
00:07:58,548 --> 00:07:59,100
components,

234
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,079
uh, memory, which is where the LLM sits,

235
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,699
um, tools, which is all about integration,

236
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,189
powers, and MCP lives here, and that's

237
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,269
a little bit of a foreshadowing for what's to come with

238
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,988
Paul a little bit later in the hour.

239
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,649
Um, and then planning, which is, um,

240
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,389
yeah, self-management, workflows,

241
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,750
separate data sets, and so on.

242
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,548
And of course the final thing is, is, is outcome,

243
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,798
which is the actual task that you've given to the agent

244
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:24,000
itself. One of the key reasons

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,559
why agents are becoming uh increasingly

246
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:29,019
attractive is because of the generational advancements

247
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:31,379
of the technology and integration

248
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,298
in all of the tech behind these concepts.

249
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,768
And I, I promised Paul

250
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:37,837
I wasn't gonna mow his lawn too much with the slide.

251
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:38,928
My apologies, Paul,

252
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,347
but it would be shameful of me not to mention

253
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,729
that Hashi Kor obviously contributes

254
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,967
significantly to the tool and planning

255
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,048
elements with Energetic AI through the

256
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,129
technology and services that they, that they have

257
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,139
created. Uh,

258
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:55,298
one further point of definition for the table

259
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:57,658
before we go any further, if you don't mind. Um, we're

260
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,009
seeing customers drive value with Agentic

261
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,178
AI across two primary categories,

262
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,820
accelerating software development and reimagining

263
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,399
workflows across the business.

264
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,460
The, uh, the prior is about using AWS,

265
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,619
uh, pre-built Agentic services, and the latter

266
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,000
provides the tooling for building your own agentic solutions.

267
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:16,500
For the sake of today, we are focusing

268
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,668
only and solely on the prior. We're

269
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:20,678
focusing only and solely on accelerating

270
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,700
software development.

271
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:25,259
So

272
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,619
When Ergenic Services first appeared

273
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:31,428
on the scene, they were almost solely um

274
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,298
coding companions. They, they, they helped developers

275
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:36,658
with the ideas of things like code completion and auto

276
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,849
suggestion, which was and is

277
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,259
quite a polarizing topic for many developers.

278
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,080
The, the playground of

279
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,379
early Agenic AI was phase

280
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,619
3 of the SDLC which was

281
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,820
all about what developers do through an IDE

282
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,379
as part of the design activities and associated

283
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,710
process. So, in the dawn days

284
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,710
of Agentic AI, which granted was only

285
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,389
2-ish years ago or so,

286
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:01,879
the value of something like Agenic AI and its

287
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,830
benefits was quartered behind qualifications

288
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:07,129
like being a developer and having

289
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,330
an IDE and working in phase 3

290
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,629
of the SDLC and so on and so forth.

291
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,269
Finding ways to expand the value

292
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,969
of agentic concepts beyond those qualifications

293
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,009
has certainly been one of the driving forces

294
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,349
in where Quiro and Q Developer have gone

295
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:22,710
over the last 12 months.

296
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,340
Uh, specifically to be more reflective of

297
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,500
the full SDLC and

298
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,779
the complete list of personas who interface

299
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,009
with it. So, our customers

300
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,349
started talking with us, with the primary question being,

301
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,889
where are folks spending their time in the SDLC?

302
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,619
Because it's not, it's not solely

303
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:40,369
code creation.

304
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,479
During our discussions, our observation became,

305
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,820
if modern development is

306
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,129
about things other than just the act of development,

307
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,678
how can we bring the value of agents to all

308
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:54,038
areas of the SDLC where people are working? Or

309
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,658
to put it far more poetically as it says on the slide,

310
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:59,099
how can the value of agentic AI be more

311
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,288
prevalent? Good

312
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,928
application design is a product of multiple personas

313
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,928
across all six phases of the SDLC from

314
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:08,450
scope and standards to

315
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,369
documentation and modernization

316
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,690
and measurement. And as a quick matter of note,

317
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,969
uh, the text that's in pink is not random

318
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,129
SDLC verbiage. These are areas and actions

319
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:17,820
where Akiro

320
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,950
uh through either the CLI or IDE modalities

321
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,168
can influence SDLC task and

322
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,210
toil and collaborate effectively with

323
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,210
the folk who, who actually work in those

324
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,788
phases.

325
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,099
So our view on this ended up being that we needed

326
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,298
to democratize the task

327
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:36,389
and toil value of agentic AI so that it was

328
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:37,639
more accessible outside

329
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,298
of the IDE by people who aren't developers

330
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,798
and didn't work in

331
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,418
phase 3 of the SDLC.

332
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:46,908
So earlier this year, we released

333
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:48,489
two features to drive that concept.

334
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,349
The command line interface,

335
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,029
meaning no need for an IDE

336
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,389
and a genetic chat, which opens

337
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,250
the door to

338
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,509
conversational natural language engagements

339
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,649
um without having,

340
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,229
uh, I suppose, to manage the context between individual

341
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:03,070
bespoke agents.

342
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,879
And it has been fascinating to see the

343
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,099
use cases that have boiled up

344
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,119
and been uncovered as a result of this. But one of

345
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,639
my favorites is something that we're socially

346
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,029
starting to call um organic transformation,

347
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,940
which is

348
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,719
when a modernization target is identified

349
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,759
by operations from stage

350
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,259
6 of the SDLC

351
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,340
and it is analyzed,

352
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:27,298
uh, planned, designed and implemented agenttically

353
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,058
without the need to traverse through half the SDLC

354
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:32,460
through um process and through phase.

355
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,469
OK. So now we get to have a little

356
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,710
bit of fun. And now I get to take you

357
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,750
through, uh, I, I suppose show

358
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,830
you um how you would effectively

359
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,989
instantiate or do something like organic

360
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:45,830
transformation,

361
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,119
uh, with the Kro CLI and what that potentially

362
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:48,649
looks like.

363
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,168
So, In this situation, I'm an ops

364
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:53,500
engineer at a fictional company. Um, I've received a ticket

365
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,019
saying that our payment processing system is struggling.

366
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,158
Um, you can see some of the details up there.

367
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,418
Uh, there's things like, uh, it

368
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:00,979
is

369
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,479
CPU utilization is currently 25%,

370
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:06,288
it's underutilized, it's taking 4.22

371
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:06,960
hours to run,

372
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,969
uh, 50,000 transactions.

373
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,298
There is a commercial impact, it should be taking

374
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:12,279
well under an hour.

375
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,750
Now, I should point out that in this scenario,

376
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,250
I used the Qua CLI to query

377
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,710
a very simple Java application that I created

378
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,950
to reflect the process of organic

379
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,700
transformation

380
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,109
within the time that we have.

381
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,509
And the eagle-eyed amongst you will no doubt

382
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,629
have seen a few of the awful, awful things

383
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,029
that I put into this application.

384
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:32,460
Things like hardcoded database credentials,

385
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,580
I've put in there like artificial timers.

386
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,830
It reads like a laundry list of terrible things

387
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,048
that you should not do to innocent applications.

388
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:40,869
Um, and

389
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,529
Whilst this is a simple application, it's

390
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,558
also intended to be a really a worst case

391
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,469
example of something

392
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,908
that many companies may have, which is

393
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,210
a modernization target that has

394
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,798
performance and security issues.

395
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:54,960
So

396
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,009
As a good ops engineer, um, I know that I

397
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,109
need to get into an analytical mindset really quickly

398
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,479
and identify what's happening with this application. So

399
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,649
I open my command prompt, I type Kiro

400
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,798
CLI which drops me straight into the interface, and

401
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,869
from there, it's a very usable

402
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,168
conversational style of engagement.

403
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,190
And as you can see, my initial prompt

404
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,229
says analyze the payment process

405
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,428
of the Java file in the legacy payment

406
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:17,969
system.

407
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,639
Now, There

408
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,788
are many reasons why this is not a great prompt. In fact, it's,

409
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,960
it's an awful prompt and chiefly

410
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,239
it's things like vagueness and lack of purpose,

411
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
but that is by design at this

412
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,538
point in time because

413
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:31,479
um

414
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,038
we're wanting to see how we can build this up in

415
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,719
a manner that sort of um begets ongoing

416
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,399
and continues improving hygiene.

417
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,178
But nonetheless, within a few seconds, Kira has given us a

418
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,259
response. Um, you can see we've got some of the details

419
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,369
in there, uh, categorized by security. It's

420
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:48,038
obviously picked up the fact that there's hard um credentials.

421
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,418
It sees SQL injection vulnerabilities

422
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:52,500
from a performance perspective. It's telling me I'm

423
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,119
not doing any connection pooling. I'm doing a lot of synchronous

424
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,759
processing. There's leaks.

425
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:59,178
Um, architecturally, I'm missing transaction

426
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,500
management. There's absolutely no error handling. It's,

427
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,340
it's, it's a bit of a nightmare.

428
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,928
But importantly, it's starting to identify risk

429
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,808
and scope,

430
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,769
um, and actions that should be taken

431
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,269
and the priority in which they should be taken and should be

432
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,710
considered. So yes,

433
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:14,168
Kiro is telling me that there is

434
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,229
performance issues,

435
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,859
but perhaps more importantly,

436
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,509
there are some major security concerns

437
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,590
and in a rather direct manner it's saying that's a priority

438
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,229
we should be um actually looking at.

439
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,109
And as a good ops engineer, um, now's

440
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:28,428
the time where I get into the power of an iterative

441
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,469
conversation with the service, um, and

442
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:32,690
I go deeper into the actual analysis.

443
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,788
Um, I do have a Palm file, which means there's integrations.

444
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,058
So, review the Palm file, um,

445
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,340
identify outdated, uh,

446
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:41,129
dependencies

447
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:42,788
with security vulnerabilities,

448
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,489
suggest modern alternatives.

449
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,928
Um, so good. My prompting is evolving,

450
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,178
um, and it's becoming a little bit more specific in

451
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:49,820
my conversation.

452
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,590
And as a result, I'm getting some specifics

453
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,190
in return.

454
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,788
This is good, we're starting to build our context, we're

455
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,099
starting to build our momentum.

456
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,668
You can see there CVEs are starting to surface,

457
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,918
modern alternatives or frameworks are being suggested,

458
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,279
and that's all good because this is some of the

459
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,259
stuff which is gonna make

460
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,798
uh lighter of the action that I'm gonna

461
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,798
have to take in the, in the not too distant

462
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,808
future. So let's quickly

463
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,849
review what we've just done to our SDLC in that very

464
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,989
short interaction by agenttically

465
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:17,869
actioning it with um,

466
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,389
well, some of the toil that we've got in our daily

467
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:23,009
environment. So analysis of new functionality,

468
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,450
creation of new features, uh, security

469
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,690
updates, codebase, architectural amendments, all

470
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,250
usually begins in phase one with BAs, tech

471
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,080
BAs, project managers, architects,

472
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,548
uh, working together. And they would normally ensure

473
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,070
some of the toil-based action, uh,

474
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,340
detailed in our working examples such as

475
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
scope and usage analysis and

476
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,918
risk capturing.

477
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,440
But by actioning this gentically, we're

478
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,509
moving those tasks

479
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,599
to an agent and we're working iteratively with

480
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,798
that agent to complete that task. And this frees

481
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,918
up the tech BAs, the architects,

482
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:56,139
and so on to focus on higher value concepts

483
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,619
like analyzing and facilitating,

484
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,080
you know, technical solutions or identifying

485
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,879
the technical aspects of business solutions.

486
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,630
By shifting the toil to an agent, we are

487
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,989
upping the efficiency of stage one. And we're starting

488
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:10,269
to gather momentum as we start moving into

489
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,848
phase two. So, happy

490
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:15,039
with the analysis of um the service, I

491
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,239
now move into the planning and

492
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:17,930
design phase.

493
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,338
And you can see over there, we're saying,

494
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,719
um what are the three immediate improvements I

495
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,699
can make to the payment processing system,

496
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,118
uh, that should have the biggest impact. Focus

497
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:27,818
on quick wins.

498
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,769
Now, based on the language um that

499
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:31,930
I've used in my prompt,

500
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,608
Quiro is starting to see that I'm edging forward. And then I'm starting to

501
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,689
look for details that are more related to planning

502
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,559
and design work.

503
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,959
So you'll start to see specifics in the responses,

504
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:40,709
such as

505
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:42,989
um replace this with this.

506
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,608
Uh, Quiro is now using the contextual awareness

507
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:47,229
that we've started to create

508
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,680
and that we're developing to get tactical on the

509
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,209
specifics,

510
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:52,568
which is a prime example of a toil-based task

511
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:53,650
that an agent can handle.

512
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,789
And that goes deeper in there.

513
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,400
Uh, in the output into things like vulnerabilities

514
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,920
and

515
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,279
uh DB transaction management and the memory

516
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,318
and resource links, uh, leaks that we spoke

517
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:03,979
about earlier.

518
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,680
But this is also where we start to see output around

519
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,759
the expected outcome and the

520
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,838
implementation plan.

521
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,279
And if this was real life, we would again be

522
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,439
iterating with Quiro to get very specific

523
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:16,799
on details like help me create a risk management

524
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,239
plan, help me create an ROI estimate, help

525
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,479
me create those assets that are important. Help me

526
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,699
design this into, you know, to being a cloud service,

527
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:24,900
and so on and so forth.

528
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,039
And much like we saw with analysis, by using a genetic

529
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,588
chat, we have moved

530
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,930
uh additional tasks to the agent

531
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,049
and we're working iteratively with that agent to

532
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:35,910
complete those actions.

533
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,559
Planning and design is one of those areas in the SDLC

534
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,039
where there's deep potential for efficiency

535
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,299
through agentic collaboration.

536
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,920
Primarily because you have BAs and

537
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,229
project managers and

538
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,750
uh developers and architects all working in close

539
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,000
collaboration to establish foundational

540
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,199
information like project foundations and what are we actually

541
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:54,739
gonna do?

542
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,118
And this can be a very toilsome action,

543
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,539
very time-consuming action.

544
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,088
Uh, specifically around some of the topics that you see there

545
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,390
with things like practice and standards and dependencies

546
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,709
and the actual implementation details,

547
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,588
uh, itself.

548
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,430
And now we get into the really,

549
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,269
I suppose, the important part, the um

550
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,529
the uh the the phase that really

551
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,650
matters, which is the idea of implementation.

552
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,029
And you can see,

553
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:22,568
my prompting is getting far more verbose at this point in

554
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,769
time and far more honest with

555
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,789
Quiro as well. I have a high priority ticket.

556
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,000
About the payment processing performance in the legacy payment

557
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
system. Based on all of the context

558
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,358
we have investigated so far,

559
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,959
create a specific and detailed plan to address

560
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,309
the performance and security issues we have uncovered.

561
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,680
Prioritize the plan according to uh

562
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,199
what will have the largest impact

563
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:44,479
in our organizational priorities of

564
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:46,489
secure customer data, um,

565
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,939
outstanding customer performance and frugality.

566
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,568
Um. In order to expedite the approval

567
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:52,410
of this plan,

568
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,809
uh, I need a change review board. I'm gonna have

569
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:56,848
to go through details like clearly identify

570
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,608
the value in terms of ROI,

571
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,309
success criteria, uplifted customer experience,

572
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,789
and so on and so forth. Identifying

573
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:05,809
the actual actions, who's responsible for

574
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,410
doing what.

575
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:08,868
Now, You can clearly see that the

576
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,939
prompting has evolved, it's purposeful, but it's not

577
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,949
restrictive. And as a result, I have

578
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,949
a much richer response, one that I

579
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:15,670
can work with

580
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:18,029
within the bounds of my prompt that draws upon the

581
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,059
foundational context that we have been

582
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,049
developing and gathering as we step through

583
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,469
what would normally be phase 1 and phase 2 and phase

584
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:25,868
3 of our SDLC.

585
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:28,670
And in this scenario, Quiro outputs a step

586
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,750
by step, uh, implementation plan

587
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,209
that I or anyone or even Quiro itself,

588
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,170
uh, can ergentically complete.

589
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,670
And that's, that's where we

590
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,848
start looking at things like

591
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,420
creating this into an asset that we can take to our

592
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,469
change review boards or work as an escalation

593
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,989
or create integrations with third-party systems.

594
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:48,795
Like Jura and so on. And importantly,

595
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:49,713
that includes

596
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,064
the systematic creation

597
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,035
as opposed to the subjective creation

598
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,614
of projected results and the

599
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:59,213
risks we're planning to mitigate and the

600
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:01,233
success criteria that may actually contribute

601
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,674
towards what our definition of done uh detail

602
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,598
is actually about. So

603
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,500
what we find happening at this point in time is something we,

604
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
that's really interesting that we didn't really quantify

605
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,779
too much at the beginning.

606
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
By giving, by giving folk the ability

607
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,259
to designate their task and toil,

608
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,108
gives them the ability to shift their value elsewhere

609
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,489
as they allocate tasks and manage the associated

610
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,539
return. The classic example here being

611
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,799
a senior developer who gets to think as a tech leader

612
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,279
or an ops engineer who gets to think architecturally,

613
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,818
or a project manager who gets to think programmatically,

614
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,239
um, because they are managing and reviewing

615
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,479
outcomes and actions that are always of a specific

616
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,509
standard. Which has some very deep

617
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,989
and inherent uh quality benefits

618
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:40,660
attached to it,

619
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,108
quality positives attached to it.

620
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,049
Great. OK, so let's go back 5 minutes to the quote

621
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,130
of the polls and apply that lens to everything

622
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,029
that I've just said.

623
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:51,750
It's still the human

624
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,489
who provides the contextual and tooling wisdom,

625
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:56,630
the strategy that prevents agents from

626
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,469
assuming in the dark.

627
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,489
This collaboration with agents, addressing

628
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,769
the toil-based activities and humans,

629
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,709
giving, giving humans the ability to

630
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:07,009
address the higher order values like orchestration and

631
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,568
so on, is a powerful concept.

632
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:11,140
So, let's take that concept of

633
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,539
human agent collaboration a level lower

634
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,618
and get into the deep details with real

635
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,209
world specifics and for that,

636
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,140
please join me in re-welcoming Paul Thrasher back to

637
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,660
the stage.

638
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,039
Hm. Thanks,

639
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,368
Paul. So,

640
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,608
at Hash Corp, what problem are you trying

641
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:32,289
to solve?

642
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,709
So, with our Atabas

643
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:36,019
uh terraform provider

644
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,519
and the ADBs cloud Control terraform

645
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,029
provider,

646
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,449
um, we're seeing constantly

647
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:42,630
accelerating growth.

648
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:45,049
So, um, here you can see

649
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:47,130
we've, uh, we currently have

650
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,209
around 3000 open

651
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:49,719
issues,

652
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,949
uh, 518,

653
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,029
uh, open PRs last I checked.

654
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:56,594
Um, And we have over 3000

655
00:22:56,594 --> 00:22:57,334
competitors

656
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,834
or contributors, but only

657
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,993
one software engineering team at

658
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:02,693
Hash Corp.

659
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:05,594
So that team is supporting over

660
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,674
5 billion downloads. I think it was

661
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,795
at 5.3 or 5.4 last

662
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:10,414
I checked,

663
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:12,973
which is about, uh,

664
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:14,055
more recently,

665
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:16,094
uh, over 5 million a day.

666
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:18,894
So every day they're dealing with,

667
00:23:19,154 --> 00:23:21,493
um, supporting quite, quite a bit of,

668
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:22,055
um,

669
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,733
users and a growing amount of resources.

670
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,578
That bring in PRs and and issues.

671
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:29,709
So

672
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,078
how does this team keep up

673
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,858
with the uh constant changes

674
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,118
and growing issues, PRs, downloads,

675
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,818
support, and

676
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,719
um you can see that

677
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,219
you know without any changes it would

678
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,739
increase past our ability to maintain that.

679
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,509
So, it's been hard to scale, of

680
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:52,170
course.

681
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,729
So scaling the team,

682
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:54,568
um,

683
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:55,630
to,

684
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,809
uh, bring on new members on board them,

685
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,729
you need to have uh terraform

686
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:03,469
experience, SDK which is uh

687
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:04,789
how you builderraform provider,

688
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,818
uh, Golang

689
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,608
and ADAS uh experience

690
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,789
all within the same engineer and of course

691
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,430
you can train that, but, you know,

692
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,750
as much as you can come in with, uh, for a

693
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,489
new engineer,

694
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:16,890
obviously helpful.

695
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,338
Uh, writing PRs, um,

696
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,949
you know, of course it's more time consuming

697
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:23,969
than reviewing them.

698
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,400
It gets our overall velocity

699
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
down, so each engineer has to, you

700
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,539
know, keep up. This is,

701
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:31,259
uh, most of their job.

702
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,150
New contributors, bringing them on, uh,

703
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,410
on boarding, they got to pick up on

704
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,509
standards, the principles, the, the ways

705
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:41,068
of working,

706
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:43,640
you know, how, how we operate within Hash Corp

707
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,838
and within this team,

708
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,318
um, which is constantly changing as

709
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,328
we deal with the growth here.

710
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,068
Um, code quality, so,

711
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,828
you know, we need, uh, sanitized

712
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,989
compliant code, of course it's gotta be

713
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:59,289
high quality always,

714
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:01,910
um, uh, ideally improving

715
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,660
over time

716
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,068
and so, you know, going

717
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,868
through that, that process of, you know,

718
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,229
hiring, writing the PRs, on boarding

719
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:09,969
new folks,

720
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:11,368
um, you've gotta

721
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:12,650
keep that rigor

722
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,309
and keeping the, the code quality high.

723
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:18,088
And security risk, as you can imagine.

724
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,858
With our large

725
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,539
customers and the large

726
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:24,920
scale of Terraform

727
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,759
and AWS,

728
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:26,900
all those

729
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:29,719
require a good amount of scrutiny

730
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,939
to make sure that there's no malicious

731
00:25:32,358 --> 00:25:34,559
code getting in through that process as

732
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,299
we bring in all these different competitors.

733
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,019
You can probably imagine some of the risks there

734
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,479
where if code were injected and

735
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,598
gets into our competitors, all of a sudden, you

736
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:45,838
know, they've got their own code

737
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,328
within banks and. Um,

738
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,338
other security products all over the place.

739
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,799
And all that,

740
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:56,559
of course, ends up with this review bottleneck

741
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,049
with the um amount of

742
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:00,430
external um

743
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:02,969
contributors also, they all need

744
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,630
experts reviewing that, that have

745
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,029
that, that expertise

746
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:09,630
um in those different uh technologies

747
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,608
and services.

748
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:13,269
And so this limits the

749
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,598
amount of viewers we can have,

750
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,989
but also just the time it takes to get through

751
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,130
that. So, I think the point here

752
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,509
is that it's, it's tough to scale this,

753
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:24,088
and so you've got to

754
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,130
consider what are your options of over

755
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,170
time, how do you make improvements to your

756
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,170
process and keep up with that

757
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,049
load. So,

758
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,368
of course, mainly it's a lot of hard work,

759
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,150
um.

760
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,920
You know, but also now we get,

761
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,269
we get some AI here.

762
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:42,750
We, we,

763
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,380
uh, I've worked with the raw models, uh,

764
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,588
you know, building things in-house, trying different

765
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:48,189
approaches,

766
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:49,189
and.

767
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,930
I think at at this greater efficiency

768
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,068
doesn't reduce engineering roles, it

769
00:26:56,068 --> 00:26:58,309
expands what teams can achieve.

770
00:26:58,868 --> 00:26:59,420
So

771
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,989
uh what do we want? What are we looking for

772
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,890
out of this? We want our human teams

773
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,410
to be more effective.

774
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,289
You know, we need to scale, scale their work,

775
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:09,170
their efforts,

776
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,689
uh, we want it to be easier for

777
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:14,170
our engineers and external teams

778
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,170
maintaining their own providers, so it's not just about

779
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,328
this AWS team too.

780
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,809
uh Sasha Corp, we're trying to scale these efforts

781
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:20,348
across,

782
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:22,439
um, uh, many partners,

783
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:24,890
and we already spent a lot of time

784
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,309
here through these maintenance cycles,

785
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,910
um. The different investments in,

786
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,338
you know, working through the PRs and reviews

787
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,400
and, and scaling, you know, our,

788
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,489
our hosting services, um,

789
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,368
along with our ability to

790
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,088
keep up with more contributors.

791
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:42,779
So it's not new for us.

792
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,368
Uh, so we've explored AI

793
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:46,838
as an option, of course.

794
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,979
Um. We,

795
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,779
uh, explored,

796
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,598
you know, trying just the raw models, you know, early

797
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:55,640
days, uh, a year or so

798
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,858
ago before agents,

799
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,180
uh, or even now you can see how

800
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,949
potentially the throughput might be

801
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:03,618
faster because you can paralyze a bunch of work.

802
00:28:03,858 --> 00:28:05,920
Um, it can be faster to,

803
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,858
to implement,

804
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,239
um, as far as, you know, getting these

805
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:11,279
things along a path, maybe throwing in a

806
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,660
CICD or some kind of um

807
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:15,500
consistent process,

808
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,680
uh, when changes come in.

809
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,209
And it's, it can be good

810
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,769
for exploration or trying things out,

811
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:24,410
but the results have been unpredictable

812
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:24,989
for us.

813
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,848
They're hard to repeat, you know, just because

814
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:30,009
you, you know, prompt one thing one way,

815
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,189
it's not going to work,

816
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,390
um, the same for another similar resource. You need pretty in-depth

817
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,108
understanding of these resources.

818
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,259
And um it depends really

819
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,519
heavily on, on

820
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:44,338
the, the prompting, and

821
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:46,539
um these are kind of operating those

822
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,160
once, once the results come out.

823
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:51,608
We've cried, uh, instruction-based

824
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,689
agents, so that's most of the agents you've seen

825
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:54,269
out there.

826
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,750
Um, they're good for,

827
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,130
you know, guiding us along those workflows.

828
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:02,309
Um, they can follow patterns,

829
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:05,009
um, that we set if, if you

830
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,390
follow them along with them,

831
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:09,049
and, uh, you know, it doesn't need

832
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,049
too much structure

833
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:11,650
or, or checkpoints.

834
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,088
In some cases, you can try to get it, you know, the

835
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:14,750
one shot

836
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,848
results and see how far you can get,

837
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,358
uh, if it goes in codes for 30

838
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,068
minutes for you,

839
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:22,880
uh, but it's still limited by the prompting

840
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,088
as, as Paul was showing us,

841
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,500
um. You still need that

842
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,588
user vigilance to um

843
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:32,180
check in on the code and make sure it's good. And

844
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,078
it can still,

845
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,598
um, between

846
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,880
implementations, drift along,

847
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,209
uh, misinterpret, uh,

848
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:40,759
kind of go in the wrong directions.

849
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,779
So,

850
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,509
we've also uh recently tried

851
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,430
spec-driven agents with uh Quiro,

852
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:51,630
now that Quiro's been out. Um,

853
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,759
We've seen it delivering uh

854
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,838
consistent high quality work for us, which has

855
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:57,900
been great, of course,

856
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,799
and we get well-defined requirements

857
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,959
after we put that, that uh

858
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,500
kind of rigor and, and pre-prompting in,

859
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:06,500
and it's been

860
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,750
great for the kind of

861
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,699
complex work that we've done

862
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:12,598
within the, the AWS provider.

863
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:14,559
I think the,

864
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:17,049
the caveat there is that it,

865
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,449
it takes a lot of the

866
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:20,910
upfront uh thinking and design,

867
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,500
um. But

868
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,930
this is, we already do this at Hash Corp. That's

869
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,250
part of our process anyway, as you know, you

870
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,279
see with the SDLC,

871
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,910
um, we, we're already going through these

872
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,509
phases, so that upfront thinking

873
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,789
just kind of matches,

874
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,588
matches our flow anyway.

875
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:40,318
So, um, we've got

876
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,598
fun numbers. This was, um,

877
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:45,259
honestly great for us and really encouraging

878
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:47,969
with, um, you know, 90%

879
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:49,170
faster output

880
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:52,118
for the development time for, um,

881
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:53,430
some of our

882
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,930
provider resources and, and actions

883
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,920
as, as I'll show you.

884
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:59,250
So we've also developed

885
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:00,930
over 700

886
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,568
high quality configuration documentation

887
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:04,598
resources.

888
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,949
So, you know, I think

889
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,449
there's, you know, thousands of resources

890
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,529
that we're managing and having to keep up

891
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:13,529
with and develop and so the documentation

892
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:14,430
of that is a big part

893
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:16,949
we've, we've applied AI to that as well.

894
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,640
And the qualities uh stayed

895
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,689
high. Um, we get quick

896
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:22,828
iteration speeds,

897
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,170
and, you know, it, it comes along with

898
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,250
the, the tests and different controls through

899
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,269
that process as well.

900
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:32,299
Throughout development, um, uh, we've

901
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,699
built over 6 terraform

902
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,799
resources, and, and the time spent there,

903
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:39,199
um, was significant before.

904
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,818
And so we've gotten over 6,

905
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,420
so far that I think this was a week or

906
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,000
two ago

907
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,699
when I, when I checked this number.

908
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,098
It's, it's definitely higher now, but also

909
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:51,219
5/5 terraform

910
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,500
actions have been created so far.

911
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:57,568
And so overall efficiency,

912
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:58,729
we've seen

913
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,789
around 90% time savings, and that's

914
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,880
been across the actions,

915
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,250
the terraform resources, which

916
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,269
in some cases a terraform

917
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:11,269
resource might take a full 40 hours of

918
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,209
work to develop, and we've

919
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,449
seen that brought down to about 4 hours.

920
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:18,900
So, great, great speed up for us, um,

921
00:32:19,568 --> 00:32:20,289
really encouraging.

922
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,640
So how do we follow the

923
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,920
SDLC process at, at Hasha Corp?

924
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,979
Um, within this, uh, analysis

925
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:28,969
and, and

926
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,500
planning stage,

927
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:33,140
we produce PRFAQs

928
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,858
and PRDs. I, I believe PFAQs

929
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:37,939
came from Amazon, uh, nice thing to, to

930
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:38,699
steal from them.

931
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,259
Um, so that's kind of the, the pre-planning, that's

932
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:41,838
a lot of,

933
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:44,160
um, you know, product management work or,

934
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,380
uh, highly collaborative with the engineering still, but

935
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,578
that, that pre-work to figure out what, what we need

936
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:49,719
to go, go out and build.

937
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,338
Um, RFCs, um,

938
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,000
have been used forever at, at

939
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,640
Hasha Corp,

940
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,699
and that's kind of the process of

941
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,019
the, um,

942
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,979
engineers

943
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,318
pre-designing what they're gonna go build,

944
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,880
kind of calling the shots, um, you know, so

945
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,739
through that design implementation phase,

946
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,779
and then of course engineering

947
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,979
happens all within our IDEs and,

948
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:11,890
uh, GitHub.

949
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,818
With the testing and integration,

950
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:17,838
uh, you know, we have, have the usual,

951
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,500
uh, unit and integration tests, of course.

952
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:23,279
Um, but with the AWS, uh,

953
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:24,239
Terron provider,

954
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,630
It's, it's fairly large, and as you can

955
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,630
imagine, doing integration tests across

956
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,789
every single AWS service is,

957
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:32,969
uh, not just slow, but, uh,

958
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,430
expensive. So that's more of an async,

959
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:37,910
uh, less often process.

960
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:40,630
But for us, documentation is also

961
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,660
key. So that's, that's a huge part. If

962
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,750
we can't bring that to you in a way that you

963
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,858
can, um, consume and understand it,

964
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,348
then, you know, we didn't do our job. It's, it's

965
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,189
not, it's not useful for anybody.

966
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,209
So through the, the maintenance process, um,

967
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,338
that's back to that uh cons

968
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:57,650
constant vigilance

969
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,068
and going through those, those

970
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:02,108
issues and PR reviews that kind

971
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,670
of feedback into that,

972
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:06,309
that, um, analysis and planning stage.

973
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:10,978
So, uh, I'll kick off the first

974
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:13,099
demo here. Um, so

975
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,438
we'll show off how we, uh,

976
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,739
applied the SDLC phases

977
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,418
within Quiro.

978
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:21,059
And, um, we're gonna be building

979
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,438
a new terraform action for the, the

980
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:24,318
ADOS provider.

981
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:26,338
So actions are new to Terraform.

982
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,739
There's not, you know, the, the models don't

983
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,358
understand them.

984
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,018
Um, they understand building it

985
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:34,139
within. Uh, you know, the Gola, if

986
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,159
you search Google for, for terraform,

987
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,559
anything, it's going to give you a bunch of HCL

988
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,668
code. So on this side,

989
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,958
it's kind of unknown to, to a lot of

990
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,320
the usual processes that, that you'd

991
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,619
hope would just work for you.

992
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:49,509
And uh so in this case, it's gonna

993
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:51,628
be a Dynamo DB crate

994
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,768
backup, which just triggers backups

995
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:55,188
for Dynamo DB.

996
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:58,447
And this is all real code we're gonna, we're gonna ship

997
00:34:58,447 --> 00:34:58,998
as well.

998
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,688
So, this is the analysis and planning stage.

999
00:35:02,938 --> 00:35:05,329
We started creating the, the steering docs.

1000
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:07,619
Uh, Kira helps with that. I think in some

1001
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,739
cases, it's just one click, it'll kick it off

1002
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:10,869
for you. So,

1003
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,418
we, you know, we go through those PRVQ and PRD

1004
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:14,110
stages,

1005
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,699
and, at Hash Corp, and it kind of

1006
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:17,719
reflects our

1007
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,599
typical process, just as it is now

1008
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,300
in the Kira way of doing that.

1009
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,159
And in some cases you might

1010
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,159
wanna do these as separate steps

1011
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,059
working with your team

1012
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:30,820
so iterate uh collaboratively,

1013
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,079
um, throw those in the repo,

1014
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:33,938
get feedback,

1015
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,780
um, but we wanna show an end to end demo here

1016
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,340
of, of how we work so we just kind

1017
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,519
of go through it quickly and it's sped up

1018
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,409
because, um,

1019
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
you know, the LMs aren't, aren't the quickest

1020
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,958
thing to run through when we wanna show the, the

1021
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,599
full, the full stage here.

1022
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,188
So, uh, the spec here is

1023
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:52,969
how to,

1024
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:54,648
uh, read the repo.

1025
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:57,489
And, uh, kind of work

1026
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,688
in the way that we want.

1027
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,289
So we had one of the, the bustron

1028
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:04,369
provider uh engineers. He's,

1029
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:06,628
he's an excellent engineer. He's built.

1030
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,438
Um, a very large amount of

1031
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,519
resources already, so he's very familiar with, with

1032
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,559
the code base so he can get in there and

1033
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,699
prompt it and tell it exactly kind of

1034
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,039
how we want to approach this work. So it

1035
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,159
is not implementation yet. This is,

1036
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,639
you know, writing the spec of how

1037
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,898
you want to operate once you start

1038
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:25,699
um

1039
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,360
triggering the next work. This is just the requirements.

1040
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,619
So, uh, here we, we

1041
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,958
write this back out manually based on

1042
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:38,079
the documentation, you can see them including

1043
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,000
other files,

1044
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,679
and, you know, just giving it good

1045
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,389
examples to,

1046
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,599
to pull from.

1047
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,579
And we allow it to refine the

1048
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,800
document. It can make

1049
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,550
some updates,

1050
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,228
go check out those files, um,

1051
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,820
you know, a bit of prompting, and

1052
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,958
there we go.

1053
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,590
It's,

1054
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,659
I love, I love this part,

1055
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:04,800
the LM does, does a bit of work for you, but,

1056
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,409
you know, it's, it's grounded in,

1057
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,829
you know, what we want out of this process

1058
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,349
and out of this document.

1059
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,148
So, then those files will be available,

1060
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,889
um. Uh, as

1061
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:17,519
part of a library that, that we're building,

1062
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,909
so you can create actions similar to we did for

1063
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,938
you, for if you're maintaining a terraform

1064
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:24,030
provider. Um

1065
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,789
Which is great as a PM I'm

1066
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:29,429
doing a talk, but I also want to extract

1067
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,378
some like product value out of this.

1068
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,289
So,

1069
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,750
in some of this work, um, I'll share

1070
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,849
later how we kind of bring it to you guys.

1071
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,329
So this is uh phase two,

1072
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,090
it's the design

1073
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,489
and implementation SDLC stage.

1074
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:46,148
So we asked it to

1075
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:47,489
create the plan for us.

1076
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:51,119
And right away, it kicks off, uh,

1077
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:53,269
kind of writing, writing some code,

1078
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,820
doing it step by step.

1079
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,500
And Kira's gonna

1080
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,958
write the code, code for you based on

1081
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,019
those uh

1082
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,469
steps that, that you kind of laid out

1083
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:03,590
in the, the task doc.

1084
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:08,320
So it, you know, it's, it's sped up,

1085
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,769
but for,

1086
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,329
you know, our, our engineering time, that was real

1087
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,590
time and how we developed this feature. I think it was,

1088
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:17,208
um, 1 hour 20 minutes total,

1089
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:19,300
so to condense that down into,

1090
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,719
uh, about 6 minutes for y'all it speed it

1091
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:24,010
up, but this is, this was the, the real-time

1092
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,628
process for us.

1093
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:28,269
And so, um,

1094
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:30,969
he's following along with, with

1095
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,429
the LM making sure

1096
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:35,030
that the code is produced properly.

1097
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,409
Um, you can see him updating the tasks and

1098
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:39,570
changing that based on the feedback

1099
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,958
from those earlier tasks.

1100
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:42,809
And, um,

1101
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,619
You know, this is, of course, like

1102
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,889
it's going to land in production, so you got to make

1103
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:49,809
sure it's up to that standards and quality.

1104
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:53,599
Uh, in this case, he didn't run into any

1105
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,800
major errors. We've been through this

1106
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,219
process, uh, a few times.

1107
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,550
We used Kiiro's CLI, uh,

1108
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,159
before this a few times. That was some of our earlier

1109
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:02,898
improvements. So,

1110
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,398
um, Kiro was relatively

1111
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:07,539
new for us, but already he was able to

1112
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,000
kind of hit the ground running in a lot of ways

1113
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,199
with, with his experience and

1114
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,079
working through the code.

1115
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:14,478
And

1116
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,070
uh Kira's gonna make sure that this package

1117
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,550
that he's building here is consistent with

1118
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,628
the other code and the other services that, that

1119
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:22,438
have been developed.

1120
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,378
So it's a bit easier when we had a couple of examples,

1121
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:27,688
you know, writing the first ever action,

1122
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,030
of course, was a long process of back

1123
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,550
and forth with Terraform and

1124
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:34,099
SDK and um other provider

1125
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:36,148
work, but once we had a few,

1126
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,188
you can kind of lean on those, those earlier

1127
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:38,769
examples.

1128
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,949
So, continued step by step,

1129
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,059
make sure it's progressing uh correctly,

1130
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,148
and then, um, you know, each

1131
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,309
of those tasks as we're going,

1132
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:49,750
they all refer back to those steering notes also.

1133
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:55,110
So, in phase 3, this is

1134
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,159
the testing and integration phase,

1135
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:57,978
um,

1136
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,829
So, we already started writing the

1137
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:01,469
test here,

1138
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:03,800
according to that task list spec uh

1139
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,349
spec list.

1140
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,789
So, In the task file,

1141
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,148
there's, you know, you go through each of those steps,

1142
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,510
and then near the bottom, that's usually where

1143
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,708
the, the tests and documentation,

1144
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:14,610
um,

1145
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:17,309
uh, is written out, so you, you'll get to those,

1146
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:18,329
near the bottom.

1147
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,719
But, uh, you know, similar to last one,

1148
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,309
it's doing live development here

1149
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,789
and this is a chance to make sure through these

1150
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,829
tests that the code's correct, it's doing the right

1151
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:27,878
things, um,

1152
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,349
it's uh the right output that

1153
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:31,329
we expected

1154
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:32,929
and um.

1155
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,398
It's writing the unit test for us,

1156
00:40:35,418 --> 00:40:37,570
and so we get to kind of make sure it all works.

1157
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,898
And after the unit tests, it goes into

1158
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,269
end to end testing.

1159
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,789
Um, I think he got tripped up on

1160
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,570
uh some credentials, you know, you need your AWS

1161
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,570
credentials to be able to run these and and test them

1162
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,070
out, but he was able to,

1163
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,369
um, you know, quickly create a

1164
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,550
Dynamo DB and then kick off

1165
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,679
that that action to trigger

1166
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,789
the backup. Um,

1167
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:00,500
so

1168
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,119
we, we did get a test fail here,

1169
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,510
but Kira was able to

1170
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,300
read the output there and go back into the implementation

1171
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,619
and fix that up, and then retest it again,

1172
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,978
and then pass.

1173
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,159
Thanks, Kiiro.

1174
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,438
So we still need to give it human readable

1175
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:18,340
instructions, but Kira's doing

1176
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,199
all the actual work and, and the testing,

1177
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,139
the actual code,

1178
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,679
and we kind of just care about the natural

1179
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,958
language um flow and

1180
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:27,539
um

1181
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:29,340
path to assist it.

1182
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:31,780
And

1183
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:34,438
near the end, you'll see it. Um, we

1184
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:36,500
also have it create the docs for us. So

1185
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:39,119
the docs can also take a long time. Uh,

1186
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,320
they're based on the API generally,

1187
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:42,458
you know, within,

1188
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,119
um, the AWSU reference

1189
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:45,668
docs,

1190
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,159
and this is going to follow the, the

1191
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,159
standard format here and standards

1192
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,039
that are the same in our other docs.

1193
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,570
So it's, it's a little bit more tedious,

1194
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:57,809
but, you know, it's still kind of formulaic

1195
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,929
as far as the docs because we often need uh

1196
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:00,648
support so many of them.

1197
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,188
So, you can kind of see how we're

1198
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:04,708
coding

1199
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,309
with the agent rather than just Quiro

1200
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:08,769
doing everything by itself.

1201
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,269
And, um, you know, from there, of

1202
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:13,510
course, we move it into a PR with GitHub,

1203
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:14,289
and then

1204
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:17,070
see what AI friend we can get to

1205
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,030
review the code to.

1206
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,550
So, um,

1207
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,289
we're thinking, as we're developing this,

1208
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:27,489
you know, how can we help you all,

1209
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,570
uh, with your AI workflows,

1210
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31,349
you know, what, what does Hashi Corp

1211
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,369
have, have for the rest of us?

1212
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:34,309
Um.

1213
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,280
You know, that was uh central

1214
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,719
kind of part of the workflow

1215
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,128
that, that we've been developing and working

1216
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:43,780
through is through, um,

1217
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,878
MCP uh uh servers,

1218
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,179
and we kind of wanted to bring some of that efficiency

1219
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:49,938
to our users.

1220
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,610
So, um, you've probably seen a bunch

1221
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,969
of talks around MCP or

1222
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,110
included them, uh, this week, but,

1223
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,539
um, you know, what's our perspective, you

1224
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:01,769
know, how do we think about it?

1225
00:43:02,168 --> 00:43:04,489
Uh, it's for us, open source

1226
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:06,619
project, um, it, it gives

1227
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:08,728
you, helps assist with your

1228
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:10,309
kind of AI workflows.

1229
00:43:10,728 --> 00:43:12,728
It's, uh, brings context

1230
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:13,309
into

1231
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,889
that developing environment, um, as

1232
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:18,099
you're working through. We, we're actually seeing some.

1233
00:43:18,438 --> 00:43:20,519
Uh, more IT business use cases

1234
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:22,519
coming out, out of our MCP servers

1235
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,418
as well, even just,

1236
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:25,510
uh, for term forms specifically,

1237
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:28,320
but it, you know, it kind of gives us that connection

1238
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,219
between our tools and the models,

1239
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:32,918
uh, you know, within, within the agent or even

1240
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:33,800
other contexts,

1241
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:36,239
and then we get the quick plug and

1242
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,260
play integrations

1243
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,800
and, um.

1244
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:41,019
Uh,

1245
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,539
you know, we've seen,

1246
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,918
we, we can write this MCP server,

1247
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,159
go give it to partners, place it in other

1248
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,199
products, which is something we've

1249
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,179
not really been able to do before.

1250
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,739
So, um, our MCP,

1251
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,860
uh, server within Quiro, um,

1252
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:02,139
you know, you kind of see some of the, the, the

1253
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,260
quick setup here, but, um,

1254
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:07,090
example prompt might be something like,

1255
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,119
I need help setting up my S3 storage buckets

1256
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:10,860
within Terraform.

1257
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,250
It's a very common task,

1258
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,570
but it's one you usually still have to

1259
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,610
go down over to the docks, go look

1260
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,769
that up, and so in this

1261
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:21,809
case, the uh MCP

1262
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,969
server will uh work

1263
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:26,128
within that workflow and

1264
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:28,128
uh kind of same pattern that you

1265
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:29,530
might do. I kind of see it as,

1266
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,250
you know, we have these workflows within our products

1267
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,309
either open source uh or

1268
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,668
um commercially

1269
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,070
and uh we just want to assist

1270
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,739
with those.

1271
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,070
And so this one will search uh

1272
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,728
content within the registry,

1273
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,610
and it can

1274
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:47,949
uh pull content from multiple

1275
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,949
docs to kind of triangulate how

1276
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:52,110
to create a resource and

1277
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,510
you know, combine those results and create,

1278
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:55,369
create the,

1279
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:56,590
the resources you need.

1280
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,458
So, um,

1281
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,418
quick demo, I just want to show off

1282
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,659
our MCP server within Quiro.

1283
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,918
So, could you help me create an S3 bucket using

1284
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:10,039
Terraform? So it's simple use

1285
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,019
case, uh,

1286
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,019
when you might have done a bunch, I've

1287
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:15,389
created so many buckets. I don't

1288
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,539
know at this point, uh, I've lost track.

1289
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,688
But, um,

1290
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:20,780
it's, it's gonna just

1291
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:23,699
start from scratch. That was empty repo there.

1292
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,699
And it uses our MCP server, and

1293
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:28,699
it got the latest provider version.

1294
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,519
Uh, it works with all the providers, not just AWS.

1295
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:34,289
But also checks multiple

1296
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:36,349
vir resource docs, it's gonna grab the

1297
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:38,250
best one for, for that context.

1298
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,550
Um, and it's nice that the model just knows

1299
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,708
how, how to do that, and the, and the agent supports

1300
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,869
that. And then

1301
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,250
you could, you know, take all this information,

1302
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,070
feed it back into those steering docks,

1303
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,898
um, for Quiro, but, you know, we're keeping

1304
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:53,668
it simple within this demo at least.

1305
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:56,938
And uh we can also

1306
00:45:56,938 --> 00:45:59,289
ask it to use public or private modules

1307
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:01,789
for you. Um, so if you're in HTB

1308
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:02,599
terraform,

1309
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,289
you probably have your own best practices

1310
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:06,070
built into,

1311
00:46:06,378 --> 00:46:08,378
to policy and modules, and

1312
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:10,599
you can grab that. And um

1313
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,418
here we have it follow a CIS

1314
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:15,840
policy that it grabs from that registry,

1315
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:18,409
and it even updates the code

1316
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,110
to uh conform.

1317
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:22,090
To the policy here

1318
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,829
And so,

1319
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:27,050
uh,

1320
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,369
later, you'll see it. It also works

1321
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,610
along with the terraform CLI.

1322
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:33,889
So, you know, our, yeah, here it is.

1323
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:36,090
Uh, so it'll do some formatting. It doesn't really

1324
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,579
make sense to have MCP

1325
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,050
run a format for you when it knows

1326
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,489
the CLI very, very well.

1327
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:43,168
So it just runs that.

1328
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:44,699
And,

1329
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,148
um, you know,

1330
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,469
for basic uh formatting and

1331
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:50,550
validation, I think that's, that's a great

1332
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,188
use case for those.

1333
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:53,329
Otherwise, I,

1334
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,070
I personally don't think that

1335
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:56,530
agents should be running

1336
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:58,969
the rest of terraform, plan and apply that,

1337
00:46:59,228 --> 00:46:59,829
um.

1338
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:02,699
You know, we, we have, uh,

1339
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,708
HP terraform to help you go through that

1340
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,849
process for collaboration and, um,

1341
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,869
security. So in

1342
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:09,728
the end we get a

1343
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,369
S3 bucket, uh, with logging

1344
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,550
and policies, and it, it's

1345
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,688
made sure it's not public.

1346
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:18,188
So it follows, you know, not

1347
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:19,989
just best practices, but

1348
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:22,929
the policies that are within your business

1349
00:47:23,188 --> 00:47:24,800
and it's usable in production

1350
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,250
conforms to

1351
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,869
what you would expect from, you know, any

1352
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:31,199
human. Um, going through the

1353
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:31,978
PR process.

1354
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:37,099
So, uh, what's next for Hasha Corp?

1355
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:38,570
Um, we're,

1356
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:41,090
we've been introducing a bunch of AI

1357
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,929
first, uh, development practices.

1358
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:43,989
So,

1359
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,590
um, we've kind of

1360
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:48,329
doubled down on that human-agent

1361
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:49,159
partnership,

1362
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:51,449
and we've, um, kicked

1363
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:53,489
off a dedicated team just

1364
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:55,530
for, uh, provider

1365
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,949
development and authoring, uh, configuration

1366
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:00,409
with AI agents. So I think you'll see a lot

1367
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:02,309
more, uh, assistance there, more tooling,

1368
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,289
um.

1369
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:04,688
And

1370
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:07,099
we also learned

1371
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,139
about uh Kiiro Powers along with

1372
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,039
everyone else this week,

1373
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,760
uh, a few days ago, and yesterday

1374
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,820
we quickly produced, uh, pulled

1375
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,599
together our docs and MCP server.

1376
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:19,000
Um, we got legal approval and

1377
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,000
and marketing

1378
00:48:20,938 --> 00:48:22,119
support, and we

1379
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,360
went out as a launch partner yesterday,

1380
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,849
um, even though we just learned about it this week.

1381
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:29,199
We developed, you know, these specs and different,

1382
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:30,099
different aspects of it.

1383
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:32,079
Um, and we're gonna launch elsewhere,

1384
00:48:32,398 --> 00:48:34,628
but we now have, uh,

1385
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,659
Hashcore, terraform, uh,

1386
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:37,478
cure Power.

1387
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,250
So, uh, that team is gonna be working

1388
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,860
on things like that, that help you, uh,

1389
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:46,148
develop your config and also,

1390
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:47,889
uh, Terraphone providers.

1391
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,889
So,

1392
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:50,800
uh,

1393
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:53,309
you know, we'll, we'll be giving out official

1394
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:55,340
agent documentation for Cairo and

1395
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,469
other agents, providing some of these,

1396
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,628
you know, each of these tools kind of have their

1397
00:48:59,628 --> 00:49:00,449
own proprietary,

1398
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:02,938
um, support, so we'll be, uh,

1399
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:03,708
building for that.

1400
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:05,250
And then, um,

1401
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,750
you know, I think this helps, uh, Hash

1402
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,148
Corp, IBM, our partners, the,

1403
00:49:10,228 --> 00:49:12,688
the whole ecosystem, our users, um,

1404
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,949
it makes it a lot easier to, to work

1405
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:16,949
within these kind of AI agent

1406
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:17,708
contexts.

1407
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,699
And uh there's a lot more to come

1408
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,199
from us, I think,

1409
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,570
um, hoping to accelerate quite a bit

1410
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,610
with uh AI within Hash Corp

1411
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,789
and pull in newest ideas

1412
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:30,800
from the rest of the industry, which is of

1413
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,378
course um how we've always operated

1414
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,300
and

1415
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:36,719
so very, very similar processes now

1416
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:37,679
that AI is in play.

1417
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:39,199
So,

1418
00:49:39,478 --> 00:49:41,708
you can go check out our Terraform

1419
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,438
MCP server, um,

1420
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:46,300
Uh, take a look at that. We've got some QR

1421
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,889
codes leave up for, for a minute.

1422
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:50,000
And we've also

1423
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,438
built them for Vault and Vault radar.

1424
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,898
I think you'll see more to come.

1425
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,378
But through there, also check out

1426
00:49:56,378 --> 00:49:56,969
our Qro

1427
00:49:57,878 --> 00:49:59,898
Power, and I think soon

1428
00:49:59,898 --> 00:50:01,840
you'll see documentation around

1429
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:04,260
best, uh, best ways to use

1430
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,438
this MCP server

1431
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,199
and these various, um,

1432
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:11,019
AI agents along with, with Terraform.

1433
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:16,898
So. Thank

1434
00:50:16,898 --> 00:50:17,559
you, Paul.

1435
00:50:18,668 --> 00:50:20,869
Thank you, Paul, much appreciated. And before we wrap

1436
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:22,949
up in a minute or two's time, I did just want

1437
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:25,139
to very quickly, uh, publicly doff

1438
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:26,369
my hat and acknowledge

1439
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:28,628
the work that you and the team have done as part of,

1440
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,789
you know, the incredible gains you've gotten around things

1441
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:31,648
like 90%

1442
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,269
time back into the day of your people. So well done to you and the

1443
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:35,750
team for everything that you've done in that process.

1444
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:38,909
Really is an amazing result.

1445
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:42,898
So, between Paul and I, we've talked about the, the

1446
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:45,260
many ways that uh, you know, the agents are transforming

1447
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,219
the SDLC. We've gone through things like

1448
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
uh backlog grooming, we've talked about things like,

1449
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:52,079
you know, requirements generation, we've talked about

1450
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,889
intelligent orchestration and so on.

1451
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,739
This holistic integration of agents

1452
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:58,639
into the SDLC is

1453
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:01,849
kind of changing it from being a bit of a linear sequential

1454
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:04,139
process to being something that's a bit more dynamic

1455
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:04,760
and loop.

1456
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,719
Shaped in the way that it goes.

1457
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,119
Where it goes is something that's gonna be really interesting for

1458
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,119
all of us to watch over the next, over the next

1459
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,260
very short period of time.

1460
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,000
But one thing it is doing is enabling the efficiency

1461
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,030
and the quality of delivery that Paul has just

1462
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,219
been covering. And

1463
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,320
to, uh, I know we keep harping on this point, but

1464
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,760
none of that actually occurs without that synergistic

1465
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,039
relationship where humans and agents

1466
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:28,668
co-create.

1467
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,159
Um, and that goes across things like ops engineers

1468
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:33,878
using agents for things like infrastructure orchestration

1469
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:35,000
and monitoring and

1470
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,320
incident response and so on. But it also goes

1471
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,398
to tech BAs who are using

1472
00:51:39,398 --> 00:51:41,719
it to analyze requirements and create user

1473
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:43,800
stories. And if you're a purist like me

1474
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,878
and you love the win then shall approach to user

1475
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:47,679
stories, have a look at what Quiro can do.

1476
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:50,719
Um, it also goes into things like architects

1477
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,039
and, uh, simulating system designs

1478
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,349
and doing things like, uh,

1479
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,659
ensuring compliance, assessing scalability,

1480
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,280
uh, project managers for sprint planning and

1481
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,280
stakeholder communication and risk analysis.

1482
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:05,688
The result is a more inclusive and

1483
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:07,688
efficient development

1484
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:09,780
environment where every role contributes meaningfully

1485
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,929
to software delivery, and that's an exciting concept.

1486
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:13,219
Um

1487
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,289
If I was to crystal ball the next 12 months, I

1488
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:19,269
think this is what it would look like for me.

1489
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,010
Um, without doubt, agents are gonna gain

1490
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,918
greater, um, autonomy, um,

1491
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:26,458
such as, you know, when they, when we start to uncover

1492
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:28,530
use cases like organic transformation that we

1493
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,489
spoke about and the, and the adoption thereof.

1494
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:33,010
But that's directly linked to something that's that

1495
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,369
we're calling true collaboration,

1496
00:52:34,728 --> 00:52:36,769
which doesn't mean heavier collaboration in,

1497
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:39,159
in this context. It means effective oversight,

1498
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,610
which, as we discussed, is one of the keys

1499
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,050
to that human agent partnership.

1500
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:46,050
And lastly and finally, our 3rd and final point

1501
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,329
for the session for the day is higher quality

1502
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:50,699
output. Um, from the SDLC

1503
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:52,668
means a quicker, straighter path

1504
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:55,050
to organizations and developers

1505
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,159
capturing the opportunities that they're working on

1506
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,369
through software, um, through software creation.

1507
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,389
So where can you learn more?

1508
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,000
There is still one of these things happening at this point in

1509
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,090
time. If you haven't gone and seen the

1510
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,168
house of Kiiro yet, which is in this building in the

1511
00:53:09,168 --> 00:53:09,688
Venetian,

1512
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:11,168
level 2 in front of the expo,

1513
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,878
go through and have a look and a walk through the spooky

1514
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:15,889
house of Quiro. It's an exciting little thing to do. It's

1515
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:17,889
kind of a cool experience. And there's great swag on

1516
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:18,829
the other side as well.

1517
00:53:20,478 --> 00:53:22,639
So thank you everybody for your time today. We really

1518
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,918
appreciate you spending an hour with us. It's been fantastic.

1519
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,898
Thank you Paul for being on stage with me.

1520
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,409
Travel safe back home and we look forward to seeing you next year.

1521
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:30,199
Thank you.
