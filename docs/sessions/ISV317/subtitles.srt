1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,050
- My name's Jeff Klaus,

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,660
I'm responsible for global
strategy for our ISV customers.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,940
I'm based in Boston.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,460
I've been at AWS just over four years.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,500
My history's been in software,

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,180
and my team put this together,

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,260
and I'm very happy to
continue and show you

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,600
what we can do to help you.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,390
So this is an opportunity
for international ISVs.

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,743
We're gonna continue to help
customers with growth paths.

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,340
And as we do that, the landscape,

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,020
as we've heard at this session,

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,280
is continually discussion around AI

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,660
and how we continue to look at that as

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,660
an opportunity to
continue our growth path.

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,770
And when we look at that,

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,660
we not only look at it
from a product perspective,

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,690
but we're also looking at
what areas, what regions,

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,750
what customer types are
we considering with that?

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,960
'Cause we have a number
of legacy customers

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,680
or continued SaaS customers
that are looking at AI projects

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
that they can pigeon into a new
region specifically to test.

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,530
It might give them a
great opportunity to look

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,663
at AI in that type of respect.

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,260
We are continuing to grow as well.

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,620
We opened five new regions in 2025.

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,120
We're gonna continue that growth with

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,200
some regions that are new,
that are projected in 2026.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,130
And the one that I wanna talk to you

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,870
about that's gotten a lot of attention

31
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,240
is really the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
So, KSA for short.

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,780
We have detailed demographic information

34
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,380
and data behind the reason
why we're going there.

35
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,160
That information is also available to you

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,160
as a customer that would
consider entry in this region.

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,540
And that is an area that
we continue to invest in.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,880
And we'll show you the
portfolio that you can consider

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
when you hear this presentation,

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,583
if you wanna consider
that potential journey.

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,100
But we know this is not easy.

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,960
We know that there are risks.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,120
There's an investment
on the customer's part

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,310
to consider this type of movement.

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,870
There's certainly competitive landscape.

46
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,600
You're not gonna be the
only one when you land

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,040
that has the product that you offer.

48
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,930
There may be some
differentiating advantages,

49
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,650
but you are going into an
area that you might not be,

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,840
you're unlikely to be the first.

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,330
Certainly, the local
technology advancement

52
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,680
might be different.

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,060
There's different client demands,

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,310
different client expectations.

55
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,050
And then the other one
that's really complex

56
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,580
is a regulatory environment.

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,480
And how does that get transferred?

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,833
How do you manage that as
a part of your operations?

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,923
So, with that background,

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,150
I just had customers asking me about this

61
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,280
for at least a year.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,937
I said, "We've gotta do better at this.

63
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:47,900
"We've gotta be able to
put something together

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,357
"that can continue to answer the questions

65
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,247
"and the objections that
we get from customers

66
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:57,480
"about navigating this type of path."

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,870
And Global Passport was
the name of the solution.

68
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,010
That's the umbrella that will
be guiding this conversation,

69
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,200
but all the components of
that will be within this talk.

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,700
So, this is a program that's essentially

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,130
a one-on-one program where we come to you

72
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,050
and we essentially give you this advice

73
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,780
from the deep plumbing of AWS.

74
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,550
Re:Invent gives you a little idea

75
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,930
of how vast the scale is of AWS resources.

76
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,510
Part of the challenge there
is finding those experts

77
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,290
who can address those areas
that I mentioned before

78
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,840
that are major challenges.

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,840
So, that's the objective
that we're going to review,

80
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,680
and we've done this for just over a year.

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,470
We're still only at about 400 customers.

82
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,540
Out of the thousands of
customers that we have,

83
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,280
there are some criteria
that we'll go through

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,150
in order to get into this
program, but we're not only--

85
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,970
we're really looking at those next wave

86
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,250
of growth opportunities here

87
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,120
in order to help with that trajectory

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,443
into a new region specifically.

89
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,300
This is probably the proudest slide

90
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,790
that I have on here from my team,

91
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,480
is that the customers
that are in this program

92
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,660
that are working through Passport

93
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,100
are growing at twice the rate of customers

94
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,510
that are not in it.

95
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,987
Now, you could say,
"Hey, those are customers

96
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:23,820
"that are looking to grow."

97
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,070
Yes, they are, but we're facilitating,

98
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,380
accelerating, we're
putting fuel on the fire

99
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,400
and helping to smooth the ROI

100
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,860
to make it as fast as
possible, and guess what?

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,440
Those account teams are
telling their peers,

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,990
their peers are telling
the other individuals

103
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,683
that they work with, and
it's continuing to work out.

104
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,520
So what is it?

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,380
Passport is essentially
four different pillars

106
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,170
that are designed to address those needs

107
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,970
that I mentioned at the beginning.

108
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,650
The first part is strategic planning.

109
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,760
We're gonna go through each of these

110
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,380
in a little more detail.

111
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,880
Next one is technical readiness.

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,670
We have some senior people
that have done this before

113
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,300
with customers that
are in 25-plus regions.

114
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,870
We wanna make sure that we
avoid any future mistakes,

115
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,510
and you can learn from their experiences.

116
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,150
And then we have a regulatory
compliance element,

117
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,820
and then we also wanna make
sure that when you land,

118
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,480
wouldn't it be nice for you to have

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,480
some pavement path paved there
to be ready for go-to-market

120
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,693
and understand the environment
when you're landing.

121
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,020
So the first piece is strategic planning.

122
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,560
We have three wonderful
partners that we work with.

123
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,860
Think & Grow does the
bulk of these sessions.

124
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,970
They're the OG of partners
that we've worked with here,

125
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,580
and we had a relationship with
Think & Grow prior to this

126
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,330
because they help our customers
with growth opportunities,

127
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,150
and we've also been using Thoughtworks

128
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,510
for some technical deep-dive
challenges with customers,

129
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,250
and then we have EDT for a
public sector specifically.

130
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,260
And what we wanna get out of this

131
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,630
is really to package a plan

132
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,630
for customers to have a
strategy to put together

133
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,317
'cause there were times when
I was asking a customer,

134
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,460
"Why did you just launch in the UAE?"

135
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,197
The response I got was,
"Well, we got one customer

136
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,667
"that said they want our product there,

137
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,767
"and my brother-in-law
happens to live there,

138
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,220
"so it's pretty easy for
me to go make that work."

139
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,960
That's not a strategy for deep
engagement in a new region.

140
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,170
So Think & Grow is made
up of really mature,

141
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,720
some senior operators that have experience

142
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,330
at taking startups into new regions,

143
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,000
and each of these partners
have different skills

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that can help you to pave
and build a strategy.

145
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,880
Then what happens is that
strategy gets components

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,660
that are listed here.

147
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,830
You can talk about any
one of these components,

148
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,900
and then you can add on
some additional items

149
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,970
if you like what you see.

150
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,370
You can even have them
help you with first hires

151
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,540
in a new region.

152
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,490
You can have them help you
with deeper go-to-market data.

153
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,260
But the program components are really just

154
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,420
kind of understanding the market
fit, how you go to market.

155
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,890
Are you channel? Are you direct?

156
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,300
What's your pricing strategy?

157
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,830
All these considerations.

158
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,040
Now, we've had some very senior customers

159
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,377
that are some of our largest
customers come and say,

160
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,210
"Hey, you know what?

161
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,020
"We want you to evaluate
our existing strategy

162
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,770
"for this next set of
regions that we wanna go in."

163
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,800
So don't think that this
is just for customers

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,030
that are emerging or just
starting out in this path.

165
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,420
We've had some other senior groups come

166
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,600
and want us to evaluate what
they're currently doing.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,860
So after that session,

168
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,240
it's about a two-and-a-half-hour session

169
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
that we spend time with initially.

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
There will be a report out

171
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
that takes approximately two weeks,

172
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,110
and that report is
something that summarizes

173
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,770
the observations that were
provided during the workshop.

174
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,840
It also gives you a set of recommendations

175
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,300
and kind of a playbook
for that next region,

176
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,130
but it's also the next, next region,

177
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,290
something that you can use as a template

178
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,010
and evaluate for future engagements

179
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,860
and give you that type of confidence

180
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,240
that you've got a third party

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,320
that's taking a look at this
and giving you some advice.

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,040
We've had customers bring
that to their board.

183
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,267
We've had customers use
this internally and say,

184
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,317
"We're not saying this.

185
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,080
"This team is also saying."

186
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
So there's definitely some advantages

187
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,220
to the report outs and the guide

188
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,143
for understanding how this would work.

189
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,710
All right, the next pillar

190
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,140
is really about technical readiness.

191
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,150
We don't want there to be any surprises.

192
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,320
Do you know that our regions,

193
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,790
we price our products differently?

194
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,500
We price our services differently.

195
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,320
We don't have every
service in every region.

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,560
We have some senior SAs, as I mentioned,

197
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,940
that have gone through this journey

198
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,110
with a number of customers,

199
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,900
and they come in and
spend an hour with you

200
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,230
to ensure that there
are some best practices

201
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,280
that are transferred.

202
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,960
Think of this as kind of
a well-architected review

203
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,960
for new region expansion, just
to ensure that your footprint

204
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,630
is as tight and as modernized as possible

205
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,150
before we start replicating
it multiple times.

206
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,100
Let's get the cost down as much as we can

207
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,060
before we have to overcome
those cold start costs

208
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,410
to achieve a fast ROI.

209
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,570
There's also security considerations,

210
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,280
performance enhancements.

211
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,780
So this is a session where the
SA, senior SA will go through

212
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,477
and talk about the
opportunities in this domain.

213
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,990
So we wanna make sure
you get the right servers

214
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,060
in that environment
that you typically use.

215
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,370
We wanna make sure that the services

216
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,750
and the features of those services

217
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,033
are available in that region as well.

218
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,020
So that is the goal of the
technical readiness session.

219
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,550
The outputs are essentially to make sure

220
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,310
that you are aware of what's happening,

221
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,310
and we'll go deeper into that
by bringing up a customer,

222
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,330
so you don't have to hear it from me.

223
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,790
We'll bring up a customer
that's gone through this,

224
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,970
and I'm gonna bring up Paul Peterson,

225
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,310
who's the regional
offering manager for Qlik,

226
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,380
and Qlik's had a great growth experience.

227
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,600
I wanna have him talk about
his experience with Passport.

228
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,703
- Thank you.

229
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,577
So just a little bit about Qlik.

230
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:30,213
So Qlik's been around
for quite a long time.

231
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,653
We've got something like
40,000 customers globally.

232
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,730
A number of product
items in our portfolio,

233
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,210
both client-managed and
SaaS infrastructure.

234
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,070
Gartner, Magic Quadrant
leader in a number of areas.

235
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,080
And we're looking to,

236
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,850
over the last kind of five years, I guess,

237
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,040
I've been with Qlik
for almost seven years,

238
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,510
like everybody, moving to cloud, right?

239
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,350
Moving to SaaS.

240
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,890
So as we move our portfolio to the cloud,

241
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,980
we are having to address our customers'

242
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,670
data sovereignty, residency,
regulatory requirements,

243
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,110
just as Jeff was highlighting, right?

244
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,320
We have hit all of those
in spades, if you will,

245
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,990
on how do we look to expand
and bring our customers

246
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,090
onto our SaaS environment.

247
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,490
So a little bit about what we do.

248
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,550
Our main platform, unlike our competitors,

249
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,990
we have a comprehensive unified platform

250
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,760
where we provide everything
from analytics to AI

251
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,440
to data management,
integration, so on and so forth

252
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,673
on our overall solution.

253
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,780
From our expansion strategy,

254
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,780
this year, in 2025, we've
added five new regions on top.

255
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,913
I think we're now over
between 10 and 15 globally.

256
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,190
We've done the UAE, Israel,
Brazil, and France this year,

257
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,180
as well as expanding our
US government footprint

258
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,983
with a new DoD region.

259
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,160
And in support of that,

260
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,430
we had kind of a base
footprint, if you will,

261
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,523
for each of our regions.

262
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,380
We were trying to reduce
the cost on that environment

263
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,540
for, you know, Jeff had
highlighted a couple things,

264
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,710
like the cold start, you know,

265
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,080
ramping up our customers,
those types of things,

266
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,170
as well as optimizing
the existing footprint

267
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,730
that we have out there.

268
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,420
So we had a number of things
that we had in a backlog

269
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,240
that we were looking to work
our way through already,

270
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,280
but being part of the program
and working with Jeff's team,

271
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,640
you know, we had a number of, I think,

272
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,780
three kind of primary items
that came out of the hopper,

273
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,740
if you will, on that front,

274
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,390
that's helping us reduce the costs

275
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,253
of our overall infrastructure.

276
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,633
So the first one was to move to Carpenter.

277
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,710
This allowed us to adjust our
auto-scaling infrastructure

278
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,160
to make it a little bit more flexible

279
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,180
on what we are able to deploy,

280
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,620
gave us a little bit more options

281
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,980
from the instance type expansion
that we were able to do,

282
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,480
ability to take lowest cost compute

283
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,660
within that environment as well,

284
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,700
and improved our ability
to scale up and scale down,

285
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,140
you know, based on our workloads

286
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,280
and, you know, the ramp period for that.

287
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,660
So you can see here,

288
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,170
as we look to deploy the
Carpenter implementation,

289
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,340
we're looking, you know,

290
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,840
some pretty significant numbers, right?

291
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,720
Saving upwards of $150,000 a month

292
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,570
after we deployed this into
our global infrastructure

293
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,270
across those regions at that time.

294
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,900
The second thing we did was to
move to partial deployments.

295
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,390
We had a standard footprint
that we started with

296
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,440
where we wanted to be able to handle

297
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,850
up to 2,000 tenants in the
infrastructure, and, you know,

298
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,853
that was a pretty hefty
footprint to start with.

299
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,220
You know, we didn't come out of the gate

300
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,570
with customers like that.

301
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,440
That's a ramp, you know,

302
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,830
to get to 2,000 is a decent ramp period.

303
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,710
So this allowed us to
reduce the cost footprint

304
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,583
by deploying a partial
footprint, if you will.

305
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,090
And we have a couple of
really high-cost items

306
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,923
that are in there.

307
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:15,480
One thing we call our one app
per engine implementation.

308
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,620
This is for customers who have

309
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,650
really, really heavy-duty
analytics workloads.

310
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,960
You know, they're really,
really large instances,

311
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,870
so this gave us the ability
to kind of shut those off

312
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,180
and save a lot on the
compute side on that front.

313
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,280
So that was good.

314
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,760
Another aspect here was
around capacity flags

315
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,960
as part of that deployment as well.

316
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,120
And this, again, allowed us to save

317
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,460
a pretty decent chunk of money
monthly on those deployments.

318
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,200
The third one, which was a
little bit counterintuitive,

319
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,230
but we adjusted the chipset, right?

320
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,070
We moved to AMD from Intel.

321
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,960
That saved a fair bit of
money on that front as well,

322
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,290
approximately $100,000 a month overall

323
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,100
across all of those regions on that front.

324
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,740
The outcome, obviously, we
were looking for cost savings

325
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,780
on that front, and you can
see a big difference here

326
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,620
between our German region
that we rolled out in 2023

327
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,460
versus the UAE one that we
rolled out in April of this year,

328
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,363
an overall 40K a month cost
differential on that front.

329
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,480
And that, ultimately, that is helping me

330
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,350
as I look at additional
regional expansion.

331
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,990
Lowering those costs
gets us more opportunity

332
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,100
to either invest in other
things in the portfolio

333
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,520
or, in our case, we're looking
to expand further in 2026.

334
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,000
We've already announced that
we're gonna go into Canada

335
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,290
in the first half of
next year, and tomorrow,

336
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,030
we'll be announcing that
we're part of the European

337
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,403
Sovereign Cloud Launch
Partner Program as well.

338
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,210
It's giving us the opportunity
to continue to expand

339
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,080
and grow by leveraging the program.

340
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,663
Thank you.

341
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,660
- Awesome, thank you, Paul.

342
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,250
So, there's a great example of

343
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,000
how we take practical examples

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,940
from past companies that
have done something like this

345
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,480
and see if that applies to a company

346
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,420
that wants to go on this journey as well.

347
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,100
And meaningful reductions in cost,

348
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,150
at the same time, we're
also trying to grow revenue.

349
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,643
So, you see there's a
great opportunity there.

350
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,440
The next pillar that I wanna talk about

351
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,460
is regarding regulatory compliance.

352
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,570
So, in this area, it's really
just about understanding

353
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,937
and ensuring that the
passport that you have

354
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:35,700
and the visa that you have is appropriate

355
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,340
when you go to that new region.

356
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,550
There are a number of
different compliance standards.

357
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,450
It also gets deeper if
you're in the medical field

358
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,620
or in the financial field.

359
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,140
So, you might not be aware

360
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,140
that AWS has ex-regulators,
ex-auditors that work for AWS.

361
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,320
They're in a group that, essentially,

362
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
is designed to help you to overcome

363
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,930
and to navigate these types of

364
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,190
potholes to ensure that you're aware.

365
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,470
And they're very familiar
with AWS services,

366
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,580
so they're intertwined with
understanding the requirement

367
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,030
and how you can overcome
that with the service.

368
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,430
So, these individuals will come in.

369
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,490
Like I said, the workshop,
you've got the strategy piece.

370
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,200
You just went through the technical part.

371
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,490
We'll bring that technical person in.

372
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,230
We're not gonna have you go around.

373
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,690
All those individuals
and experts come to you

374
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,160
with this bespoke program.

375
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,050
And then the regulatory individuals,

376
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,920
they also come in and they
give you their perspective.

377
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,753
Where do you wanna go?

378
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:40,320
Here's what to look out for.

379
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
We also have tools to ensure

380
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,430
that you can pass regular
audits in this regard, as well.

381
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,500
So, that is the third pillar

382
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,553
and a pretty large piece, as
well, that we wanna remove.

383
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,360
The next piece is around go-to-market.

384
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,940
Wouldn't it be nice to
be able to be confident

385
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,590
when you land in a new arena
what that will look like?

386
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,120
And I often equate this to--

387
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,090
I think most of us have
been into a new airport

388
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,230
for the first time.

389
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,360
You've been to that new airport.

390
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,290
You're tired.

391
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,360
You might be jet-lagged.

392
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,100
You picked up your bags.

393
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,690
You go out through customs.

394
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,337
And then you're in this sea of people.

395
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,170
And you have no idea where to go.

396
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,280
Maybe there's a foreign language.

397
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
You can't even read the signs.

398
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,860
You're trying to find the taxi.

399
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,870
You're trying to find,
you know, the shuttle.

400
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,743
Where do you go?

401
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,950
In the distance, you've
got this little sign.

402
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,570
It's got your name on it in the distance.

403
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,640
And you're like, "Oh, my
gosh. That's so awesome.

404
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,230
That person's gonna show me where to go."

405
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,390
I pre-booked that person to help me.

406
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,620
That's what this is.

407
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,110
When you land in Saudi Arabia,

408
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,630
and you wanna work with a local
partner there, guess what?

409
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,700
That partner is someone you can trust,

410
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
someone that knows the landscape.

411
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,180
They know the customers and the partners.

412
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,787
So we wanna set you up with
people that know that landscape.

413
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:56,790
It's strange, when I come
here, I always feel like

414
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,170
somebody wants to sell me something,

415
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,900
whether it's here in the
taxi or going anywhere.

416
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,250
And it's hard to trust them, right?

417
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,860
So you need to work with people you trust,

418
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,000
and that's what this is.

419
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,380
The partner program has
a wealth of capabilities

420
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,380
that can offer you through
Marketplace, the partner network,

421
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,860
and these individuals
understand how to navigate that.

422
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,420
So they use this matrix of
different co-sell activities

423
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,270
in order to help educate the AWS team,

424
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,340
the local team, on your solution,

425
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,820
and kind of build some momentum

426
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,820
and some discipline from how
the best companies operate

427
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,580
because they've operated

428
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,980
and they've seen how those companies work.

429
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,900
So it's things like CRM integration,

430
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,000
scalable motions around co-sell,

431
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,520
and I'm gonna let some of
them speak to you about this.

432
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,260
So what we've done so far

433
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,990
is that we've pieced
together some partners

434
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,750
in different regions that can help you.

435
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,180
They know the landscape, and
as a part of the program,

436
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,660
we help pave that first instance.

437
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,980
We pay for the use and
utilization of those individuals

438
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,980
in order to get that
first set of opportunities

439
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,670
under the covers.

440
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,310
Now, the other exceptional data point here

441
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,160
is that Passport Catalyst customers,

442
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,760
'cause we call this final
pillar Passport Catalyst,

443
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,540
those customers are growing 65% faster

444
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,220
than the regular Passport customers.

445
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,710
So you've got people
that are not in Passport,

446
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,660
and then you've got double
the growth for Passport,

447
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,250
and then you've got 65% higher

448
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,260
for people that are in Catalyst.

449
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,160
So you see there's momentum here

450
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,300
in what we're trying to build,

451
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,810
and that's the value of
where we're taking this.

452
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,980
So I'm gonna have some partners

453
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,630
come and talk to you about what they do,

454
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,220
how they operate with their customers,

455
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,710
and give you some specific
customer examples.

456
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,660
The first is Symbio.

457
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,920
So I'm gonna bring up Justin,

458
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,420
and then he'll bring up Francesca,

459
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,173
and he'll talk to you about his
experience with the program.

460
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,870
- Thank you, Jeff.

461
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,703
Morning, everyone.

462
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,480
Thank you for being here,
my name's Justin Eddy.

463
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,630
I'm the founder of Symbio.

464
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,840
It's good to have you here.

465
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,050
Symbio is a cloud go-to-market agency.

466
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,880
So we specialize in AWS, Co-Sell,
and co-marketing services.

467
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,770
And our goal, as Jeff mentioned,

468
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,600
is to accelerate that journey
to Co-Sell revenue with AWS.

469
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,530
So what we do is we bring
together three services

470
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,510
within the Passport Catalyst program.

471
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,850
Those three services
are here on the slide,

472
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,170
partner marketing services.

473
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,270
So starting with that,

474
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,900
we focus on your joint messaging
and positioning with AWS.

475
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,510
How can we clearly articulate
that better-together narrative

476
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,790
to the AWS customer, to the AWS ecosystem,

477
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,590
so that we know you're
landing that message

478
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,030
with maximum impact?

479
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,450
And then build the content

480
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,400
and the campaigns to tell that
story and drive awareness.

481
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,100
The second is the Co-Sell
enablement services.

482
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,930
This is really driving that
message to the AWS sellers,

483
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,370
as well as to the partner sellers,

484
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,420
to help them work effectively
with AWS sellers in Co-Sell,

485
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,580
help them to understand the best practices

486
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,130
and have the materials and toolkits

487
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,310
to drive Co-Sell opportunities
and joint sales engagements.

488
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,100
The third is the fractional
partner staffing.

489
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,070
So our team provides AWS-enabled PDMs

490
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,890
who can navigate the AWS programs

491
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,070
and the variety of resources

492
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,540
to help partners to unlock and qualify

493
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,170
for these go-to-market
benefits within the program.

494
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,640
And we provide Co-Sell
specialists who help to execute

495
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,450
on joint sales engagements
and to enable best practices

496
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,730
for working with AWS on
specific opportunities

497
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,830
and expanding those.

498
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,840
All three of these kind of come together

499
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,200
in the Catalyst program to
enable this virtuous cycle,

500
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,730
which you see here,

501
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,390
starting with kind of
partner-led co-marketing

502
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,660
driving the content and the messaging

503
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,490
to drive lead acquisition
and pipeline generation.

504
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,290
That really opens the door to
connecting with AWS sellers.

505
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,360
Once you're working with AWS sellers,

506
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,150
you build those
relationships and the trust,

507
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,820
opportunity by opportunity,
seller by seller,

508
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,010
you can expand that relationship

509
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,120
through these best practices
to other accounts, their peers,

510
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,600
other sellers, into
broader sales enablement

511
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,010
and identification of other
accounts and opportunities

512
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,230
that you can work on and
then repeat this cycle.

513
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,110
So all three of these
services come together

514
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,070
to enable that virtuous flywheel effect

515
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,583
of Co-Selling with AWS.

516
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,060
So we have a great example of this today.

517
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,720
I'm excited to have Darktrace,
our mutual customer here,

518
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,090
to talk about a real-world
story about this.

519
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,720
So I would love to
introduce Francesca Bowen,

520
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,770
VP of strategic alliances at Darktrace.

521
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,770
- Thank you, Justin.

522
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,220
And thank you, Jeff.

523
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,330
Well, it's lovely to see everyone.

524
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,420
And I'm really privileged to
be part of this conversation

525
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,170
because we've had an awesome
experience with Passport.

526
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,640
Actually, firstly, with Think
and Grow at the very beginning

527
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,020
and then with Symbio

528
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,330
when we really looked to kind of expand.

529
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,903
So show of hands, who is
not familiar with Darktrace?

530
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,740
Okay, only a few.

531
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,920
Well, that's good

532
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,680
because I love to just
give a bit of a background

533
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
on the story and the history

534
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,060
'cause it's a really
interesting organization.

535
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,810
Darktrace was the first to apply AI

536
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,760
to the challenge of
cybersecurity back in 2013.

537
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,100
This is before the big rage of AI

538
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,170
and certainly before we were talking

539
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,330
about AI and cybersecurity.

540
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,960
And so what we do is
we learn the behaviors

541
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,200
of individual customers.

542
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,700
And we are able to, in real
time, to detect and respond

543
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,570
against never-before-seen threats.

544
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,760
That's really, really helpful
for our 10,000-plus customers

545
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,340
but particularly in regulated
industries like manufacturing

546
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,940
which is what we'll talk about today.

547
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,760
So yeah, we'll do a billion
dollars in ARR this next year.

548
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,130
We were listed on the
London Stock Exchange.

549
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,200
We've now been bought out by Thoma Bravo

550
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,980
a big PE firm in the U.S.

551
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,190
And it's been an incredible
journey with AWS.

552
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,430
I'd love to just talk
about the Passport program.

553
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,140
So just again, show of hands,
who is interested in Passport?

554
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,123
Who's part of it today?

555
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,300
Okay, so it might be early
days for some of you.

556
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,100
So what I would say about
Passport is the secret to success

557
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,800
is gonna be intentionality, right?

558
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,280
You've gotta be really intentional

559
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,390
with what you wanna get
out of this program.

560
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,880
And so let's think about
the kind of the challenge

561
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,350
for Darktrace at the time.

562
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,950
As you can hear, we're a
British-born organization.

563
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,400
And so we are managed
by AWS out of the U.K.,

564
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,233
which is awesome.

565
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,130
That's where our dev is.

566
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,530
But ultimately, it means
that all of our resources

567
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,800
is in the U.K. and EMEA from AWS.

568
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,800
And so just naturally, well,
naturally alongside John here

569
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,900
who runs our alliances in EMEA,

570
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,000
we grew very quickly in that region,

571
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,830
but less so in the U.S.,

572
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,810
which again, for our business in general,

573
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,740
didn't make much sense

574
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,980
because ultimately, we
do more of our revenue

575
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,420
out of the Americas.

576
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,120
So we wanted to elevate
the AWS partnership

577
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,520
specifically in North America.

578
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,240
And we wanted to kind of
mature that co-sell mechanism

579
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,593
that can be so awesome, you
know, between our sellers.

580
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
So what do we do and how do we do it?

581
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,320
So ultimately, the
Passport Catalyst funded,

582
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,230
as Jess said, the ability to work

583
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,300
with an organization like Symbio.

584
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,440
And that was really awesome

585
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,400
because what happened was
that we were assigned a PDM,

586
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,170
so a Partner Development Manager,

587
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,290
with that kind of AWS-specific skill set.

588
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,290
And they really, and she, Maria,
extended our alliances team

589
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,670
and really helped us to nail down

590
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,700
the better-together messaging.

591
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,160
That is the most important thing

592
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,640
when you're going to market with AWS.

593
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,470
So we think about back to the objective,

594
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,430
ultimately, we were trying to
mature our co-sell efforts.

595
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,220
And so our customer in this

596
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,630
is kind of the AWS seller, right?

597
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,960
So we need to think about
how, in manufacturing,

598
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,420
we decided to choose that industry

599
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,250
because it's less saturated

600
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,800
against things like financial services.

601
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,640
How are we gonna help
the seller sell more AWS

602
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,520
or reduce friction to sale?

603
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,060
Ultimately, leading to more revenue.

604
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,250
And again, for Darktrace,

605
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,890
what we do is we secure organizations,

606
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,320
particularly in regulated industries,

607
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,540
across their entire digital estate.

608
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,920
So if you think about manufacturing,

609
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,720
there's a lot of legacy
operational technology, IT,

610
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,420
and they want to kind
of gain the efficiencies

611
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,110
and benefits from cloud, but
can be slower on the uptake

612
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,480
because of that security challenge.

613
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,820
And so this is where
Darktrace come in, right?

614
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,920
So we make a great
partner to the AWS seller

615
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,630
to really help drive additional revenue

616
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,440
and help the customer
transform towards AWS Cloud.

617
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,050
So with that story, Symbio
built this brilliant

618
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,860
to AWS and through AWS kind of assets

619
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,860
that we still use today,
even after the campaign.

620
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,660
They're absolutely fantastic.

621
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,480
And then ultimately, we package it up

622
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,290
to create a very targeted
marketing campaign

623
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,290
into medium, large size
manufacturing companies in the US.

624
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
So what were the results?

625
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,160
They're pretty good.

626
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,110
I was pretty happy.

627
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,510
So, you know, the numbers
speak for themselves,

628
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,390
but I think what I'd like
to highlight is a couple,

629
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,330
well, three things that
got me really excited.

630
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,060
The first one was access
into organizations

631
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,950
that we'd never engaged with before.

632
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,290
In fact, we had meaningful engagement

633
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,060
with 10 of the kind of top
50 manufacturing companies

634
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,527
in America that we had never
meaningfully engaged with.

635
00:29:24,527 --> 00:29:27,270
That's a really big deal, right?

636
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,890
The next thing is procurement.

637
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,750
So I didn't mention, but of course,

638
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,670
we're on AWS Marketplace, right?

639
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,740
And so really interestingly,

640
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,360
we did some pretty sizable deals

641
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,480
with manufacturing
organizations on Marketplace

642
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,160
and, you know, one memory
that I have is an organization

643
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,040
that would have typically
taken three months to procure,

644
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,920
but again, with Marketplace,

645
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,280
we were able to do that in under a month

646
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,040
and that was a very sizable deal.

647
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,020
So we love that.

648
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,233
And then the final one is that number 49.

649
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,670
So as sales and partner
leaders in the room,

650
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,650
I think, you know, we can all build

651
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,650
the best possible programs,
but at the end of the day,

652
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,080
it's really about our seller engagement

653
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,510
between AWS and Darktrace.

654
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,900
So we've got 200 plus reps trained

655
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,030
on the Darktrace side, which is awesome,

656
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:26,000
but 49 manufacturing sellers at AWS

657
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,660
are thinking about Darktrace

658
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,130
and thinking about how we can help them

659
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,940
sell more of what they want to.

660
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,213
So for me, that was probably
the most exciting thing.

661
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,500
Jeff, thank you so much.

662
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,833
- Super, thank you.

663
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,313
All right.

664
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,543
Awesome, thanks, Francesca.

665
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,020
Yes, great example of how this can work.

666
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,360
And I think the beauty of this

667
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,310
is that you're really focused on,

668
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,290
Symbio can help focus on the process.

669
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,670
Like here are the results,

670
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,080
but the process there is about building

671
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,940
the maturity, the muscle memory

672
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,430
of what does it take to
get these types of results?

673
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,620
And if you can keep
doing that going forward,

674
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,530
that gift is gonna keep on giving.

675
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,870
So it's a fantastic result there.

676
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,700
So I also wanna talk a little bit

677
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,280
about where this is a global program.

678
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,280
We are testing some partners in APJ.

679
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,820
We don't have that fully
baked and ready to offer.

680
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,060
We obviously are showcasing
here that we have North America.

681
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,390
I'm gonna bring up our
partner that we use in EMEA.

682
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,470
And then we're also working

683
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,660
with a partner in the Middle East.

684
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,340
And that APJ is kind of
in progress at the moment.

685
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,780
But a lot of interest there as well.

686
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,220
So what I'm gonna do next
is talk about Connect

687
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,900
and their story, bring up Jonathan,

688
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,040
and then he's gonna bring up Max

689
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,290
to talk about his specific example

690
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,210
of their working relationship.

691
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,880
- First of all, Jeff,
thank you for inviting us

692
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,430
and being such a great sponsor.

693
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,440
And thank you everyone for attending.

694
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,450
My name is Jonathan.

695
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,410
I'm CEO and co-founder at Connect.

696
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,567
A bit about our story, seven
years ago, I was working

697
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,630
for one of the biggest ISVs in Israel,

698
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,533
a lot of hype around it.

699
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,240
And following an investment
by a cloud provider

700
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,180
that we won't mention its name here,

701
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,120
we were tasked to, together
with Yuval, my partner,

702
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,880
we were tasked to build Cloud Alliance.

703
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,310
We didn't know what exactly it is,

704
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,433
what it means, how the impact looks like.

705
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,470
But we understood that
there is a lot of potential

706
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,130
in the scope, so we needed
to double down on it

707
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,903
and really understand what it is.

708
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,713
So this is how Connect was born.

709
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,580
And what we do at Connect,

710
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,880
we support ISVs at all maturity levels,

711
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,790
build their partnership,
business partnership with AWS.

712
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:10,790
From early stage partners that
need their foundation built,

713
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,870
from the basic programs,
ISV Accelerate, Marketplace,

714
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,560
and so on, to better
together story narrative,

715
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,560
and the executive alignment,
to much more advanced partners

716
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,020
that requires deeper differentiation,

717
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,390
business development,
global business development,

718
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,593
and co-sell at scale.

719
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,490
Since we established the company,

720
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,380
we served more than 200 ISVs.

721
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,900
We're based out of Israel and the UK,

722
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,030
and alongside the professional service

723
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:52,780
that really provide 360 for all
Cloud Alliance requirements,

724
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,370
we develop our own proprietary
go-to-market platform

725
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,340
called Flow, that besides connecting

726
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,840
and operationalizing all the systems,

727
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,900
also provide a data
layer, an insights layer,

728
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,210
to actually take the best practice

729
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,210
that we developed internally
and expose them to our users.

730
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,660
Regarding our partnership with AWS,

731
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,480
so it's really growing rapidly.

732
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,590
We are in multiple programs,

733
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,860
but of course the most
important one is Catalyst.

734
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,080
We are in the third wave of Catalyst,

735
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,080
served more than 35 ISVs,
generated significant revenue,

736
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,610
and a significant pipeline.

737
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,220
I think that one of the
most important things

738
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,740
that we provide as part of the
program is not only the fish,

739
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,580
but we teach the ISVs how to fish.

740
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,270
If there is a problem or
something that doesn't work,

741
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,940
we dive deep and find the source

742
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,400
to enable them to afterwards

743
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,220
either do it with us after the program

744
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,783
or do it independently.

745
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I want to call to the stage Max,

746
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,060
Senior Director of Global
Partnership at Riskified,

747
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,153
to give his point of view on that.

748
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,260
- Thank you, Johnny.

749
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,990
Thank you, Jeff, for
inviting me to come here

750
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,833
and share the story of Riskified
with both Connect and AWS.

751
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,850
And I'll try and do that in the

752
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,030
next five or so minutes as well.

753
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,250
I wish I was part of the session before,

754
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,083
you know, a year ago,

755
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:48,960
and we're looking into starting
the partnership with AWS,

756
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,060
but I'm happy I'm here now,

757
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,530
and it's very interesting
to see the perspective

758
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,500
of some of my peers as well.

759
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,450
So for some context,

760
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,450
Riskified is in the fraud
prevention space of e-commerce.

761
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,060
So essentially we work with
the world's largest retailers

762
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,720
in helping them approve more
transactions in a safe manner

763
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,250
and prevent fraud in real time.

764
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,260
So we sit at the checkout

765
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,260
and we help them assess the
risk of those transactions.

766
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,670
And the interesting piece here is that

767
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,000
everything we've built
as a company, right,

768
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,570
since the foundation is on top of AWS.

769
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,740
All of our data is stored in AWS.

770
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,320
We utilize a lot of the microservices

771
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,093
and security mechanisms of AWS.

772
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,720
And so this question of whether or not

773
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,960
we should expand the
relationship with the address

774
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,800
is not necessarily new to Riskified.

775
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,670
But some of the two biggest
challenges I think we had

776
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,070
when we looked at this was,

777
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,060
the first one is we are
targeting very large retailers.

778
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,040
And we were skeptical about
those types of companies

779
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,860
buying multi-million
dollar software or services

780
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,080
through the marketplace, right?

781
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,630
We didn't think that was a thing.

782
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,610
Riskified has very long sales cycles,

783
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,710
very complex, high touch,

784
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,000
and we thought that
someone wouldn't do that

785
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,880
through this channel.

786
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,830
We were wrong.

787
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,830
And the second thing was just
that we didn't know enough

788
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,675
about how to get set up
and where to start, right?

789
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:31,980
And I think this is kind of the theme

790
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,030
that we've been hearing
across the board as well.

791
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,190
And the advice we received was

792
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,720
you should work with an external company

793
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,230
that is specialized in doing this, right?

794
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,040
That is taking potential
ISVs like yourselves

795
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,200
and bringing them to the marketplace.

796
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,580
And they will know what to do.

797
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,310
If you committed the same
mistake that I did in the past

798
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,620
of trying to figure this out yourself

799
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,330
and read through the documentation,

800
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,520
you probably got lost or
thought this was too complex

801
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,393
and overwhelming.

802
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,270
Honestly, it probably is.

803
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,970
But there is a strategy to it, right?

804
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,070
There is a way of doing it in a smart way

805
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,810
and doing the things that matter first

806
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,720
and then expanding from there.

807
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,680
So we worked with Connect

808
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,720
to try and understand and
kind of bridge those two gaps

809
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,170
and concerns that we had.

810
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,530
And from the first conversation
we had with them, right?

811
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,470
Number one is we, again,
understood that we were wrong

812
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,900
and multimillion dollar contracts

813
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,680
were being signed through the marketplace

814
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,680
and large, large retailers were
utilizing that as a channel.

815
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,530
So that was great, right?

816
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,580
One of our concerns is dealt
with and no longer is there.

817
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,180
The second one is Connect really helped

818
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,970
bring a lot of clarity
to the process for us.

819
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,530
We're a small team and, you know,

820
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,670
we're doing what we're
doing very successfully.

821
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,930
And so we needed to make sure

822
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,130
that if we're putting resources

823
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,353
and time away from what we've been doing,

824
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,400
that it will be the right call.

825
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,930
So they explained to us, right,

826
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,680
all the key milestones and
things that we have to do first

827
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,390
in order to get the flywheel
effect of the marketplace

828
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,387
and, you know, AWS as an ecosystem.

829
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:22,320
And so that's what we set out to do.

830
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,550
And also, luckily, we had
the support from the program

831
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,790
that Connect had with
AWS and Catalyst, right,

832
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,960
in helping fund for that.

833
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,460
So, again, everything
we were worried about

834
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,690
was no longer a big deal for us.

835
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,930
And this was being funded as well.

836
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,083
So we had nothing to lose but
to try and make this work.

837
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,300
So when we started working with Connect,

838
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,500
we put together very specific deliverables

839
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,750
that we would be working on a time

840
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,423
frame of four to six months.

841
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,250
And that was also very specific

842
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,260
in terms of what Connect
would handle for us

843
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,350
versus what would be required
from Riskified's team,

844
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,990
whether we're just
supporting with information

845
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,820
or we had to be hands-on
part of the process.

846
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,530
Just a few weeks later, right,

847
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,620
we had our technical review done.

848
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,640
We were listed officially
on the marketplace

849
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,160
and, you know, that was great news for us.

850
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,010
But we're just starting that process.

851
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,080
We didn't have a lot
of go-to-market motion.

852
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,760
Shortly after that, right,

853
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,060
we finally got our competency
approved in retail.

854
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,340
Obviously, that's the biggest industry

855
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,950
for someone like Riskified.

856
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,160
And from there, things started to catch up

857
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,570
and it started to get interesting, right?

858
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,220
We were done with all the very important

859
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,700
but a little bit more
bureaucratic and technical steps

860
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,590
that we had to accomplish.

861
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,420
And we did so in probably
around a month and a half.

862
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,783
And we would never have been
able to do that ourselves.

863
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,990
Then from there, we started to participate

864
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,490
in multiple programs, right,

865
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,470
that helped us collect additional funding.

866
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,680
You know, our CMO was very
happy with the amount of MDF

867
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,560
that we were getting as well

868
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,560
and became an ISVA very
shortly during that period.

869
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,980
And once we became an ISVA,
ISVA Accelerate, right,

870
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,660
that's when you have access
to start co-selling with AWS

871
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,670
and you have access to the sales teams.

872
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,810
And, you know, here I heard
the word being intentional

873
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,960
and I completely agree with what you said.

874
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,130
That's the approach that we took as well

875
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,410
in making sure that when we're
pumping the opportunities

876
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,220
through ACE, right, that
we're looking for connecting

877
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,040
or speaking or engaging
with the sales teams,

878
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,120
we were very intentional,

879
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,120
meaning we only submitted
opportunities that were real,

880
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,130
opportunities that we
had context, background,

881
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,240
and we had something to share.

882
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,910
We're not just trying
to be overly optimistic

883
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,400
and do a moonshot through that.

884
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,730
And so when we spoke
with those teams at AWS,

885
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,000
they clearly understood
that we had some footprints.

886
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,490
Some of those opportunities
were existing clients of ours

887
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,550
that were just looking to,
you know, extend a contract

888
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,340
or do an upsell or a cross-sell.

889
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,300
And so that led to them
wanting to speak with us again,

890
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,740
right?

891
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,940
Again, same thing here.

892
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,240
They understood how Riskified's
deal could help them

893
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,530
upsell their AWS services too.

894
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,103
And so our information
was valuable to them.

895
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,720
And just to close off here

896
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,430
with some of the
high-level results, right?

897
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,460
This has been 12 months
or nearly 12 months now

898
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,760
that we finally decided
to start this process.

899
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
We have a pipeline of
close to $40 million.

900
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,240
We closed about three to
four deals already this year,

901
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,140
which is a huge win.

902
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,200
Again, our deals are, in
nature, large in size.

903
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,520
And we've accomplished much
more than what we, you know,

904
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,920
thought that we would be able to do,

905
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,400
and we have a lot more
to do now next year.

906
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,740
So in 12 months,

907
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,830
AWS became a hyper-growth
engine for Riskified

908
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,720
that we're super excited
to double down next year.

909
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,003
Thank you very much. Jeff, back to you.

910
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,270
Yeah, that's a great example.

911
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,690
When you talk about anybody
who knows navigating FTR

912
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:28,200
and navigating ISVA and what
you need to do to reach ISVA,

913
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,320
to do that in around two
months is phenomenal.

914
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,820
That is great testimonial
to how this can accelerate.

915
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,177
And originally, we were taking
customers that were only ISVA

916
00:43:39,177 --> 00:43:40,867
and we're thinking,
"Why are we doing that?

917
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:43,987
"Let's help some of the customers
that have a great product.

918
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:45,277
"They still wanna grow.

919
00:43:45,277 --> 00:43:49,027
"They've yet to be mature
in the partner motion.

920
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,460
"Let's help them get there."

921
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,490
So we removed that requirement,
and now any customer,

922
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,620
if you're not a marketplace,
you can also use this

923
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,080
as a springboard to get there.

924
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,120
So how does this work?

925
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,530
We have a nomination process.

926
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,420
You can go through your account manager.

927
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,590
You can even just do a Google

928
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:08,940
search for AWS Global Passport.

929
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,370
It should come up. You can
nominate yourself there.

930
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,620
And then we have sessions.

931
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,630
We've done these in 22 different cities.

932
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,600
We try to come as close
to you as possible.

933
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,370
We've done them all over the world,

934
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,700
and typically, it's about
once every month and a half.

935
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,550
So schedule that discovery workshop.

936
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,350
You review the action
items from the report

937
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,300
that comes from the partner,

938
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,970
and then there's a
one-hour follow-up session

939
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,560
to identify those next steps.

940
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,100
Like, that's the logistics
of how this works

941
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,170
as we schedule it.

942
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,880
We do have a minimum revenue threshold.

943
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,690
We have gone beyond ISV.

944
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,780
We have gone to some startups
that are below that threshold.

945
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,720
If there's a great growth
story, I'm a sucker for that.

946
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,720
We'll definitely take
that into consideration.

947
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,090
We're looking at success
in the home market.

948
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,910
We certainly want executive sponsorship.

949
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,930
The maturity stages, we've
kind of changed that,

950
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,000
but we certainly want you to be an APN

951
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,600
and know what's expected
'cause it is a commitment.

952
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,960
You do need to be prepared for that path,

953
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,560
but as we've talked, we have
individuals that can help you,

954
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,523
guide you through that path.

955
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,540
Who do I want in these
sessions when we have them?

956
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:28,290
We typically say, I want
the person who's responsible

957
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,150
for the target in the new region.

958
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,740
Who owns the number to
reach that sales target

959
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,890
in that new area?

960
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,400
That person's gonna really care

961
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,350
about making sure that this plan is solid.

962
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,360
And then at the other side,

963
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,340
I want the person who
pays for that cloud bill.

964
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,810
Who's gonna pay for that new region?

965
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,880
Whose responsibility is it in their budget

966
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,880
to have those increases in
expense and take that risk?

967
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,450
And we often see great debate happening

968
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,150
between these people in these sessions.

969
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,210
There's often a debate
about where do we go first?

970
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,640
We've had large customers
come to us and say,

971
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,640
can you help me force
rank the next three areas

972
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,000
that we wanna consider growing in?

973
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,400
Okay, we've done that.

974
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,560
We have used partners to
get data in some cases,

975
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,480
or we've used some AWS data.

976
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,700
What type of customer are you selling to?

977
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,760
How can we help inform
you to make a decision

978
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,110
to break that tie if there's
a challenge internally?

979
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,660
These are the individuals that we want

980
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,103
in order to have that session.

981
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,740
So this is a summary, this
is what we learned today.

982
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,960
We talked about the strategy pillar.

983
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,910
We talked about technical readiness.

984
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,850
We have a regulatory element as well.

985
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,730
And then we had some great
examples on go-to-market.

986
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,320
'Cause initially, guess what?

987
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,710
Go-to-market is still
our biggest challenge.

988
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,300
When you land in a new region,

989
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,550
you can put an instance up today.

990
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,260
You can put a new instance up.

991
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,180
If you don't have those
technical problems,

992
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,670
you can open up and be available.

993
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,080
But how do you generate sales
and get that motion working?

994
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,130
That's the biggest challenge,

995
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,250
and that's why we are relying
on some great partners

996
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,700
in order to make that happen.

997
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,880
So here's a path to the public site.

998
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,570
If you don't have an
account team covering you,

999
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,310
this is a path to scheduling a workshop.

1000
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,760
We do have some operations
people that can help,

1001
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,520
and that is how we operate.

1002
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,720
So anyway, thank you.

1003
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,770
Hope you learned something,

1004
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,740
and hopefully this is something
you can take advantage of.

1005
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,959
Appreciate it.

1006
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:36,042
(audience applauds)
