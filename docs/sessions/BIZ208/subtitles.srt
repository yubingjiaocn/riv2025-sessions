1
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:03,459
Welcome

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,379
And

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,828
thank you everyone. We understand

4
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:09,489
this is the last session of the day.

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,398
And I really thank you for being

6
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:14,868
here. This

7
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:17,658
session is biz 208,

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,609
how to enhance your SAS application.

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,179
With Amazon Quick Suite.

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,690
We are going to talk all about

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,379
how to.

12
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:30,609
Get value as well as velocity

13
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:31,958
with Amazon Quick Suite

14
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,590
as well as ISV independent

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,740
software vendor SAS applications.

16
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,770
We will talk about what's not working,

17
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,579
what has changed, and

18
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,209
how you can innovate

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,789
with your application and Amazon Quick Suite.

20
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,709
With that, I'm Sonali,

21
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,009
Sonali Sahu.

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,689
I lead the global specialist solution

23
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,929
architect team focused on generative AI

24
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,009
in AWS and I'm honored

25
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:58,149
to take the stage

26
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:00,329
with Brandon Idelson.

27
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,529
Chief ecosystem Officer of

28
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:04,088
Zoom,

29
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,489
as well as Bibhuti Sinna,

30
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,338
Chief Product Officer for Savient.

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,769
Brandon. Well, it's

32
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,930
wonderful to be here at Zoom. We're

33
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,198
building a

34
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,058
platform that is the AI first platform

35
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:18,668
for work,

36
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,180
and as the chief ecosystem officer, I'm

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,338
all about how we build connections

38
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:25,278
across the tools that people use every day

39
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,918
to help create an amazing ecosystem

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,260
of systems working together.

41
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,519
So excited about the content in today's session.

42
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,379
Thank you, Brandon. Bibuti.

43
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,278
Thank you all. Thank you very much for being here. And

44
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,299
uh Bibutiana as chief product officer of

45
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,569
Savient. Our mission and motto

46
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,769
is to secure and govern every identity,

47
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,629
be it human,

48
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:46,489
non-human, and now of course AI agents

49
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,778
which everybody's raving and talking about.

50
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:51,209
So I'm really looking forward to talk about

51
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,230
what we are doing in this space, how the

52
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:56,010
overall identity security ecosystem is evolving,

53
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:58,209
and looking forward to this session today. Thank you.

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,269
Thank you, thank you.

55
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:01,849
With that, let's get started.

56
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:04,250
Quick quick agenda.

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,500
A quick introduction

58
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,838
about Amazon Quick Suite focused on

59
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,270
specific features

60
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,860
for your SAS application.

61
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,778
Then we will talk about two

62
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:16,300
different

63
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,349
SAS application integrations,

64
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:21,219
Zoom and Savient with Amazon QuickSuite.

65
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,479
Finally, next step and call to action.

66
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,979
With that, let's get started.

67
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:31,240
I will start out with something which

68
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
feels very real to me.

69
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,399
My everyday work

70
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,699
used to start with

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,979
opening up multiple different tabs

72
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,319
and tools before even I get

73
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,319
to my first

74
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,000
email of the day.

75
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,389
One tap for data,

76
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,088
another for insight,

77
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,729
another one to reach out to my teammates,

78
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,490
another one for decision, yet another one

79
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,808
to actually execute the action on

80
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:58,629
that decision.

81
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,250
Every single hop,

82
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,719
every single jump slowed me

83
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,330
down. It's a friction.

84
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,919
And this is not the story

85
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,270
of me alone.

86
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:11,058
I know this is the story of every

87
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,139
single user in modern day

88
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,460
era. Can we give

89
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,159
the time back to the employee

90
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,979
so that they can focus on the outcome and

91
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,088
decision? And not this busy day

92
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,479
work. For

93
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,838
that reason, we have Amazon

94
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:27,349
Quick Suite.

95
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,699
Amazon Quick Sweet.

96
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,028
It truly reimagines

97
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,189
how the modern day work happens.

98
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,099
First, it collects combines

99
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,080
all the data.

100
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,860
On top of the data, it offers

101
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,020
agenttic capability with custom as

102
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,050
well as chat agent.

103
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,159
If you have a need for automation, it

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,979
offers

105
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,508
quick automate as well as

106
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:52,419
quick flow

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,179
for orchestration work.

108
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,319
Additionally,

109
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,740
it offers deep research

110
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,800
capability with your research

111
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,409
agent.

112
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,939
It also offers the BI capability.

113
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,360
So you can think about Amazon

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,538
Quick Suite as a unified

115
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,330
agentic

116
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:11,979
workspace

117
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,460
for any

118
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,319
user.

119
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:17,117
And

120
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,648
how is it possible?

121
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,629
This is possible because

122
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,358
of our collaboration, Amazon Quick

123
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,678
Suite collaboration with our ISP

124
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:27,488
partners.

125
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,709
We are on this together.

126
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,410
We are going to deliver end to end

127
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,048
context,

128
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,660
research, insight,

129
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,428
everything in a unified platform,

130
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,569
wherever the work is happening.

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,619
We truly believe.

132
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:44,199
That

133
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:47,149
this can be delivered with an ecosystem

134
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:49,088
that no one can deliver in isolation.

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,048
And that is why when you combine

136
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,088
the agentic AI capability of

137
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:55,309
Amazon Quick Suite

138
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,709
along with the deep domain

139
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,509
segment or vertical expertise

140
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,759
of our partners, you get something

141
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,670
transformational.

142
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,108
You get the unified workplace

143
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,750
where the insight flows effortlessly

144
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,129
without any friction.

145
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,278
And this is not something

146
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,819
that is happening in future. This is

147
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:16,720
already happening.

148
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,139
So let me show you what are the

149
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,600
features offered by Quick

150
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,540
that your SAS application

151
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,920
can leverage to integrate

152
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,278
and enhance with this.

153
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,649
Two pillars we will talk about.

154
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,220
The first one is index data.

155
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,319
And the second one is the actions.

156
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,869
We will go one at a time and look into

157
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:43,189
the detail of those pillars.

158
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,559
Index data

159
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,678
One of the core foundation.

160
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,829
Of Amazon Quick Suite,

161
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,170
it says knowledge based and data

162
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,899
sources.

163
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,850
It can collect data from multiple

164
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,250
different data sources,

165
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,069
whether it is internal,

166
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,988
such as your wiki or product page

167
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,048
or internal communication channel,

168
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:09,470
or it can be external,

169
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,350
such as your

170
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,048
project task management on Asana.

171
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,389
Or you are talking about your meeting summary

172
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,139
from Zoom

173
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,600
or any other third party

174
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,399
application like Confluence, Jira.

175
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,980
So all those data can be

176
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,139
aggregated, combined as well as

177
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:27,819
indexed.

178
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,649
Quick not only

179
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,230
understands, but also maintains

180
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,678
the permissions and access

181
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,910
control set by the

182
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,939
applications. It solves

183
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,160
one of the persistent problems

184
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,199
that we have been talking about to

185
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,819
find the relevant information

186
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,379
from the data source. It truly democratize

187
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,059
the access

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,100
to your data

189
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,019
with enterprise grade security.

190
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,798
It's the high level overview of index

191
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,209
data. Let

192
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,548
me now show you

193
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,149
how your SAS application.

194
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,889
Can integrate with this index

195
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,088
data. I'll

196
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,209
walk through this high level flow.

197
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,629
On the very left hand side.

198
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,410
You are seeing Amazon Quick

199
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,119
Suite, as already discussed,

200
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,769
the knowledge base and data sources, one of

201
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,350
the core functional foundation

202
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,928
for Amazon Quick Suite,

203
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,528
that is there.

204
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,459
It supports both structured

205
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:37,879
as well as unstructured data.

206
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:41,278
It supports end to end enterprise

207
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:42,559
grade security,

208
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,079
security rested,

209
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,540
as well as security in transit.

210
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,759
And now

211
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,139
this index data can be accessed

212
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:51,920
from the

213
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,540
SAS application.

214
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,649
On the very right hand side,

215
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,358
you are talking about your SAS

216
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,420
application. That is your life data,

217
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,579
your customer data, your proprietary

218
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,988
business intelligence.

219
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:08,189
From your SAS

220
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:08,869
applications,

221
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,809
now you can call into this index

222
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,548
data. How that is possible?

223
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,600
Because of the middle layer,

224
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,290
that is the interoperability layer.

225
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,059
And why are we doing this?

226
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,100
We are doing this for our customers.

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
Now our customers can

228
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,420
access

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,988
their index data from both Amazon

230
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:32,739
Quick Suite

231
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,399
as well as the SAS

232
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,940
application of their choice.

233
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,957
They get benefits in two specific

234
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:40,638
areas.

235
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,109
One

236
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:44,168
is

237
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,467
clarity, and the second one is

238
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,947
speed and confidence in their workflow.

239
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:53,080
The first benefit clarity.

240
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,779
So customers have index data.

241
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,678
Your SAS application now can combine

242
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,879
this index data with the live data and

243
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,908
can give the end to end context

244
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,019
to your customer,

245
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,700
so they get the clarity

246
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,879
and the context.

247
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,149
The 2nd 1,

248
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,788
the speed and confidence in your workflow.

249
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,279
Customer has one index data

250
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:17,369
that is in Quick.

251
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,000
Now the same golden data

252
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,529
that they can access from the

253
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,599
application of their choice.

254
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:27,259
Not only the data we are talking about, your

255
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,349
application can combine the indexed

256
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,029
data, live data,

257
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,619
your tools, your applications,

258
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,729
and can give the enhanced.

259
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:39,019
Workplace for the customers.

260
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:42,090
That means they don't have to stitch

261
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,109
together anymore

262
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,529
any additional tools and

263
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,690
applications. Now

264
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,668
that we understand how this can be done.

265
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,879
I'm very happy

266
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:54,869
to share

267
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,519
our partners

268
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,080
who have already integrated

269
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,769
their applications

270
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:02,460
with our index,

271
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,119
our customers.

272
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,808
They can go to these ISV

273
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,928
partners applications and can

274
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:12,009
leverage the index data from

275
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:12,928
that application.

276
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:18,808
Now let's look into the 2nd pillar.

277
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,899
That is the actions.

278
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,570
And again,

279
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:24,849
I'll walk you through

280
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:27,389
the similar, a little variation

281
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,229
of the diagram.

282
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,739
Like how

283
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,960
your SAS application

284
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,379
can be integrated

285
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,119
with the actions on Quick

286
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,609
Sweet. On

287
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:39,629
the left hand side.

288
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,759
It is Amazon Quick Suite.

289
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,859
That is your AI teammate.

290
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:48,129
In addition to the data,

291
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,849
knowledge based and data sources, it also

292
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,820
offers actions. It has over 2290

293
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,538
actions

294
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,000
already supported

295
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:57,399
on Amazon Quake.

296
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,639
You can also orchestrate

297
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,928
this action

298
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,668
with quick automate and quick flow.

299
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:08,830
Additionally, Quick also

300
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,570
supports a managed MCP

301
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,229
model context protocol client.

302
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,899
With few configuration parameters

303
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,288
on MCP client,

304
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,950
now customers of Quake

305
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,750
can call into any MCP

306
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,788
server or actions of

307
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:27,729
their choice.

308
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:33,668
As mentioned before, QuickSuite already

309
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:35,830
supports the, uh, security

310
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,649
addressed as well as transit.

311
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,349
With the MCP client, it

312
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,580
additionally supports different types

313
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,830
of authentication.

314
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,389
We are talking about three-legged

315
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,500
authentication, 3 yellow or 2

316
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,690
yellow. So

317
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,889
that is the left hand side, Amazon Quick

318
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,609
Suite and its actions.

319
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,359
On the right hand side,

320
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,259
that is yours as application.

321
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:03,869
That is where

322
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,250
you will decide

323
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,729
to host

324
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,190
your MCP server that

325
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,250
can expose

326
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:14,330
both the tools as well as

327
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:15,330
agents.

328
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,609
Your tools can map back to your

329
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,710
operation, code operation,

330
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,969
create, update, delete, delete

331
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:23,869
uh type of operations.

332
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,369
Once you

333
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,000
have the MCP tools,

334
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,298
as well as agents on your

335
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:32,210
SAS application.

336
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,548
With the authorization of your

337
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,609
customers,

338
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,379
they can access those actions

339
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,469
from within Amazon Quick

340
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:44,349
Suite. How that is possible?

341
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,830
Because of the intermediate, the middle

342
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,950
layer that you are seeing in here.

343
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,969
That is the interoperability layer, which

344
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:52,788
offers

345
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,048
both built-in.

346
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,009
As well as MCP

347
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:59,308
Open Protocol standard. You can think

348
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,668
about the middle layer as a bridge that

349
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:03,668
speaks the common language to bring

350
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,649
in Amazon Quick Suite on the left

351
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:08,190
to the SAS application on the right-hand side.

352
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,210
So now you saw the end to end

353
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,099
integration,

354
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:15,960
how a SAS application

355
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,649
can be integrated with Amazon Quick Suite through

356
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:19,428
an actions.

357
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,070
And I'm happy to say that these

358
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,149
are some of our ISP partners

359
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,070
in third party applications.

360
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,678
Those are already integrated.

361
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,330
With Amazon Quick Suite.

362
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,190
Our customers

363
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,489
can directly go to Amazon Quick

364
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,590
Suite, and can see those

365
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,168
actions and can use those actions

366
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,048
as they need it.

367
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,950
Now that I have walked through all the features

368
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,960
of Amazon Quick Suite and how

369
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,038
your SAS application can use those

370
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,109
features and enhance your

371
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,259
application and what is the customer benefit would

372
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:56,899
look like,

373
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,700
now I'll take a pause

374
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:01,500
because I would request Brandon

375
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,859
to talk about how they have integrated

376
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,750
their Zoom application

377
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,119
with Amazon Quick Street.

378
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,509
So Brandon,

379
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,859
thank you so much.

380
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:13,009
Well, it is so exciting to be here

381
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,759
to talk to you about Zoom

382
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,869
and our journey and how we've integrated with QuickSuite.

383
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:20,090
But before we dive into all of that,

384
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,889
I'd love to maybe set some context

385
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,070
here. When we look out

386
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,590
in the world these days, and we talk to customers,

387
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,599
we hear that the world has become noisy

388
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,779
and fragmented.

389
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,389
Now this probably rings true to everyone in this room,

390
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,479
having walked the strip and the exhibit

391
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,639
hall. It's a little noisy here at the conference,

392
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,019
but this is going beyond conferences.

393
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,759
Workers are seeing more and more

394
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,099
applications in their

395
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,739
environments that they're being asked to use,

396
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,099
and AI is starting to get rolled out,

397
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,759
but it's becoming another tool, more

398
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,500
friction.

399
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,899
And folks are going,

400
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,269
how do we leverage this technology to

401
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,048
do better?

402
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,830
And it's a clear challenge, and the market

403
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,869
signals of this are extremely

404
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,969
clear. When we look at

405
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:06,009
the statistics,

406
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,658
most organizations have over

407
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,779
93 applications

408
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,330
deployed across their IT infrastructure.

409
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,019
Think about the context switching when you're going

410
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,500
between that many apps and onboarding

411
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,019
employees.

412
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,330
And so employees are looking for amazing

413
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,479
AI. Most

414
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,529
are looking for something that is purpose built,

415
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,739
that's gonna help them do their job better.

416
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:30,798
And

417
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,058
when you then talk to the IT buyer.

418
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
They are investing in AI because

419
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,519
they know how important it is.

420
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,029
So the market signals are

421
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,279
clear, this is the time, there is

422
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:42,820
the demand.

423
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:46,000
So it's really about how we action this

424
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,359
as ISPs to take advantage of this

425
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:51,048
moment. So

426
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,269
with all this, you might be asking,

427
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,330
why Zoom?

428
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,000
I know Zoom

429
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,558
because of the video conferencing.

430
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,080
How does this fit in?

431
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,250
Well, Zoom is actually a suite of

432
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,529
products. Video conferencing was our initial

433
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:06,769
flagship, but we've grown beyond that

434
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,849
to a whole suite of communication, collaboration,

435
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,250
business services, to help across

436
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,479
a full range of business use cases.

437
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,109
So we are helping people with their video conferencing,

438
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:19,450
but also helping them run their contact center,

439
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:20,629
whiteboarding,

440
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,048
collaborating in whatever format works

441
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:23,750
well for them.

442
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,849
But what you'll notice here,

443
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,168
across this entire

444
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,619
diagram of our suite of products,

445
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,889
is there are two things bookending it.

446
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:34,849
At the top is our AI platform,

447
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,389
with AI Companion, that serves as

448
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,889
connecting tissue across

449
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:41,349
all of these features within the platform.

450
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,609
But then on the other end, as you see on the bottom,

451
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,609
there is the ecosystem.

452
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:49,099
Because we realize that it is important to

453
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,879
connect across

454
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,359
so many different tools that individuals use.

455
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:56,570
It's part of the reason that Zoom has a chief ecosystem

456
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,729
officer, and that's the role that I enjoy filling.

457
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,009
Now, when I say an open

458
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,129
ecosystem,

459
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,328
I truly mean open at Zoom.

460
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,979
We don't think about just integrations, it's

461
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,858
really about how do we connect

462
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,239
to the tools that folks want, because

463
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,917
we don't want to replace the tools people

464
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,327
have. We want to integrate seamlessly,

465
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,468
so we're matching them and meeting

466
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,999
them in their flow of work.

467
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:25,328
And when we can build these experiences,

468
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,608
where you are able to connect

469
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,088
data with the context, with the workflow,

470
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:33,509
you create these magical moments

471
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,150
where AI actually turns into something

472
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:38,509
that isn't just supporting, it's fully

473
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,910
enabling someone with their day to day work.

474
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,529
Now, for us, AI has been a journey.

475
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:47,239
Just a few years ago,

476
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,729
we embarked on this by releasing our

477
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:50,838
AI Companion

478
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,799
1.0, that started off with meeting summaries.

479
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,578
But since then we have continued to evolve the

480
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:57,199
solution

481
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
and are moving towards an genic framework

482
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,199
with our

483
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,500
uh AI Companion 3.0.

484
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:05,858
And we're very excited about what it can

485
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,059
do, and what an agenic

486
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,059
framework allows and how it starts to

487
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:10,880
connect work.

488
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,338
Now, in order to do this and really

489
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,900
have something that's agentic,

490
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,559
we can't just work

491
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,900
within our product, we have to be able

492
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,380
to meet people where they are.

493
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,578
And so with 3.0, we're actually

494
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:26,338
expanding this platform

495
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,920
to work across someone's day to day.

496
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,838
You're seeing two examples here in the slide.

497
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,539
On the left, we have my notes, where

498
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,358
someone is, as you can see there,

499
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,729
in a Google Meet,

500
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,299
but they're able to take notes using

501
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,199
the Zoom platform,

502
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,699
so we're meeting them with the tool in the session

503
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:44,358
that they need.

504
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,709
On the flip side, on the right, you can see

505
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,789
someone that is using our AI companion

506
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,670
3.0 for web,

507
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:54,509
and they're querying it, but they're getting

508
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,608
value from integrations that they've

509
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:57,979
made with

510
00:18:58,309 --> 00:18:59,049
with other

511
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,969
products that they're using, such as Google Drive and

512
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:02,598
Confluence.

513
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,650
So it's all about bringing the data

514
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:08,229
and the user into that amazing

515
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:08,890
workflow,

516
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,229
exactly where they want to be.

517
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:12,779
And so that's why

518
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,358
we wanna work with the tools that people use

519
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,699
and not work around them.

520
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,759
Because when you start to think about it.

521
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,838
When you connect the context to the work,

522
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,059
it creates this magic moment because,

523
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,318
because the AI then knows the context.

524
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,108
It's aware of what's happening and you start to

525
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,719
get to these moments where you can actually take a

526
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,779
conversation all the way to completion.

527
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,519
And so that's where we're designing and

528
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,519
working on fitting our solution in.

529
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,130
Now, it's been very exciting working with

530
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,130
Amazon, because we've been able to deliver

531
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,150
on this value.

532
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:48,848
And one of the great examples is the integration

533
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:51,170
that we already have and that is working

534
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,709
today with Amazon

535
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,328
and AI Companion.

536
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,750
Tell me if this example rings very true to

537
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,650
you. You're in a meeting.

538
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,259
Let's say,

539
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,959
talking about the latest sales numbers, or maybe it's

540
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,160
a project planning meeting.

541
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,140
There's that question that comes up where you need.

542
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,130
An answer to it,

543
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,709
and how often is it that that would become a

544
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,568
follow-up to go deep dive in the data.

545
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,219
But with the power of having these platforms together.

546
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,959
You can use AI that has the context

547
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,059
of the conversation about what was important

548
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:25,880
with the index data

549
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,279
that Amazon has gathered

550
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,640
across its indexes and merge that with

551
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,799
AI so you can get the answer in

552
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,118
that moment and it's no longer a follow up, it's

553
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,199
actually a completed action, and

554
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,660
you can move the business

555
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,199
forward and continue to move faster

556
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,799
at the growing pace that we have.

557
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,729
And that's what truly excites us.

558
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:48,199
But this is just the beginning of this journey.

559
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:51,250
And as we all know, AI

560
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,759
is evolving so quickly and

561
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,239
in opening so many cases.

562
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,078
So along with that,

563
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,509
Zoom is continuing to invest,

564
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,890
and one of the areas that we're investing in

565
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,328
is MCP.

566
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,160
As was mentioned earlier,

567
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,598
this is an exciting new protocol,

568
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,650
and we are really excited about it

569
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,769
because it allows us to extend the

570
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,769
number of tools and connections

571
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:14,670
that are available

572
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,509
in the Zoom platform.

573
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,449
And by connecting them, we're giving

574
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:21,469
access to the ISPs

575
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23,890
that folks want to use in their day to

576
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,568
day work.

577
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,250
And MCP due to its scalable nature,

578
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,430
makes it very easy for us to onboard

579
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,009
additional

580
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,890
uh folks into the ecosystem,

581
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:35,568
and really unlock this connective tissue

582
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,088
across an enterprise's tech stack.

583
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,000
Now when I talk about MCP.

584
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:44,269
We're actually looking at it in two different

585
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,118
formats.

586
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:46,618
On one hand,

587
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:49,199
Zoom wants to be an MCP client to be

588
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,199
able to use those actions that

589
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,439
are available from other ISPs

590
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:55,739
so that they can access it within Zoom.

591
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,660
But really, if we want to meet users where they are,

592
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,559
it's also about Zoom providing an MCP

593
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,098
server

594
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,660
so that for other products and solutions,

595
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,078
they can access the tools that Zoom have and

596
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:09,118
meet the users in their context.

597
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,108
And I think that's what really excites

598
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:14,250
me when I talk about the work that we're

599
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,709
doing with QuickSuite.

600
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,769
Because when you think about this,

601
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:20,368
we're now talking about the ability of

602
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,640
two agents to be able to work

603
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,828
with one another,

604
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,689
to empower the user and meet the user

605
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:27,818
wherever they are.

606
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,459
To get the job that they want done,

607
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,039
we're removing friction and complexity.

608
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,420
The UI, the experience they want,

609
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:37,779
it's there, and they have access to

610
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:40,219
the data, the actions, and

611
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:42,219
everything to get the work done that they're trying

612
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,259
to do so that the technology fades

613
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,920
away and they can focus

614
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,039
on the work at hand.

615
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:50,108
So this is what's really exciting to me.

616
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:53,039
And this is an area that we're embarking in

617
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,789
right now.

618
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:55,199
And so with that,

619
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,900
I'd love to show you.

620
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,390
The work that we've been doing

621
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,769
with a very first preview out of

622
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:02,588
our labs

623
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,130
of that MCP server exposing

624
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,160
our whiteboard feature that could be accessed from

625
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,729
QuickSuite.

626
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:11,469
So if we go to the video here, you can see that

627
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:13,130
someone has been working in QuickS Suite,

628
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:15,868
talking about an OAth flow, and it's

629
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,489
describing how that works.

630
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,979
But words are one thing, you sometimes want a visual

631
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,059
to understand that.

632
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,930
So they can prompt within QuickSuite,

633
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,608
and as it thinks through it, it's able

634
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,309
to know that Zoom has a whiteboarding tool

635
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,368
that can take

636
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,529
that narrative and turn it into

637
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,108
a sequence diagram.

638
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:38,650
And so within a moment.

639
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:41,289
Zoom has already come back with a quick

640
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,670
link to pop someone instantly in a whiteboard

641
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,368
that they can look through that sequence that they just

642
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:48,719
saw described verbally,

643
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,328
and they can then go in and edit and modify

644
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:53,799
it. Think about this and

645
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,529
this use case across so many different

646
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:57,650
business processes.

647
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,598
And this is just the beginning of

648
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:01,818
what we're looking at.

649
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,618
So, I'm very excited seeing

650
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,199
what we're doing here.

651
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:08,939
And I know there's a lot more that we're going

652
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:09,459
to do.

653
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,118
When I look at our road map.

654
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,509
This whiteboard is just the beginning.

655
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,390
We're looking across

656
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,549
people's day to day work effort.

657
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,949
Whether that's helping them prepare for the meeting.

658
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,118
Providing insight within the meeting,

659
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:27,729
or taking those after actions,

660
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,439
providing these options up so that

661
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,019
Zoom and QuickSuite can work seamlessly to meet

662
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:34,239
people where they are day to day,

663
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:36,259
is what's truly exciting to me.

664
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,618
If you'd like to learn more about AI Companion, we've got a

665
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:41,858
QR code, but it is so exciting to work together,

666
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,459
and I look forward to the more we can do.

667
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:46,930
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Brandon,

668
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:49,489
thank you, Brandon to walk us through.

669
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,868
Through the applications,

670
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:53,949
Zoom applications,

671
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,670
and its integration, not only with

672
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,709
just index data, but with actions and

673
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,868
how they have enhanced their application with

674
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:01,489
QuickSuite.

675
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,559
Now I will change the gear.

676
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,098
We just looked into a use case

677
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,118
that is a business application use case.

678
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,318
It's a productivity improvement use

679
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:13,358
case, and now we will look into a different

680
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:15,630
kind of use case, and that is

681
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,180
around the security and identity.

682
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,299
And for that we have Bivutti

683
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,160
from Savient to talk about

684
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,318
their application and how they

685
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:27,049
have integrated with Amazon Quick Suite.

686
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,519
Thank you. Thank you, Sonali.

687
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:31,130
Brendan, thank you so much. It was really, really cool

688
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,709
to see what uh you guys are doing at Zoom, and

689
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,009
I'm very sure that we're going to start taking a lot of

690
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,088
advantage of uh those use cases.

691
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:39,348
But, but

692
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,848
now let's change gears as Sona you rightly mentioned. Let's

693
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:42,709
take a look at.

694
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,910
What are we doing with Amazon Quick

695
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,989
Suite when it comes to securing identities, which is a

696
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:50,009
serious business when you think about

697
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,209
putting compliance, putting audit hats,

698
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,108
and before I start talking about QuickSuite,

699
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,029
let me just

700
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,430
give you a very quick spiel of what has happened

701
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,769
in identity security.

702
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:02,068
If you rewind your clocks and go till

703
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:04,269
2014, 2015, what

704
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,430
you would find is that.

705
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,108
Identity security and governance was a mere

706
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:10,439
compliance plate. It was an audit plate. It was

707
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:11,930
thought of as a checkbox.

708
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:14,489
Are you certifying your access? Are you looking

709
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,608
at who is doing what with their

710
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,150
access, whether it was for human identities

711
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:21,449
or little bit of non-human identities

712
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:21,989
in that case.

713
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:25,189
But as 2015-2016

714
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:28,489
happened, there was a series of breaches

715
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,719
which happened and they used identity

716
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,650
as a launch pad

717
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,439
and what that changed in the identity

718
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,828
world was that identity

719
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,868
security

720
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,630
became more of a security pillar.

721
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,250
It became the cornerstone of any

722
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,219
company's cyber security strategy

723
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,009
that truly changed the narrative of how identity

724
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,130
security started evolving.

725
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:51,479
And then fast forward, when you started looking

726
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,759
at when uh generative

727
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,989
AI started picking up.

728
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,868
The biggest shift which is happening

729
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,209
now in identities,

730
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,809
this is now becoming a core pillar of

731
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,868
any company's business transformation.

732
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,750
If you are dealing with AI, if you have

733
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,900
an AI strategy which every

734
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,640
organization on this planet is doing,

735
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,969
you cannot have that strategy without

736
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,088
having a comprehensive identity security strategy

737
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,368
to have

738
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,709
a meaningful return on your investment with

739
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,910
what you're doing with AI you have to have

740
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,289
an effective identity security strategy

741
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:26,890
that's the major shift that's what.

742
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,818
Uh, happened and the reason why this all

743
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:32,239
happened was the definition of identities

744
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,279
kept on changing,

745
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,608
as I mentioned,

746
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:37,328
to 2014, 2015, every

747
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:39,799
organization on this planet was thinking about humans.

748
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:41,289
As an identity,

749
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,789
but the definition of those humans also

750
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,358
changed.

751
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,959
Uh, many of you would have noticed that during COVID

752
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,509
times there was a, there was a massive

753
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,650
increase in supply chain, uh, workers,

754
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,130
and that became a big notion of

755
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,670
the, the definition of identities kept on

756
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,868
changing and shifting from internal

757
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,269
employees to external workers.

758
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:02,670
Privileged users was always in the mix,

759
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:05,259
but then the ratio and the,

760
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,979
the whole rise of cloud

761
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,719
really changed the dynamics with a massive

762
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,380
explosion

763
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,140
of non-human identities

764
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:15,279
which started, if I remember it correctly, in 2017,

765
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,759
it used to be 1 to 4.

766
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,279
Today it sits somewhere between 1 to 60

767
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,430
to 1 is to 85.

768
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,880
That's the ratio with which the identities

769
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,779
have exploded.

770
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:25,500
And now with all

771
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,358
the work what the industry is doing on generative

772
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,439
AI, AI agents are the new norm.

773
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,229
The trend what we are seeing is that every

774
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:34,338
organization who have been in this

775
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,380
experimentation phase they're now

776
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,118
really putting these agents to work in production

777
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,578
environments and this is getting more and more serious

778
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,160
so that's what the evolution of identity

779
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,199
was and so far it has been going

780
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,199
on and that is why we

781
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,039
have been investing in Savient.

782
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,559
We truly believe that this is a single

783
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,219
most versatile unified platform.

784
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,140
To secure and govern any and every identity

785
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,910
which you have

786
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,469
for for enterprises, for organizations

787
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:01,289
who are looking

788
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:03,709
to secure and govern their identity ecosystem.

789
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:07,108
Now let's take a look at some of the deterrents

790
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:09,259
of when a company

791
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,338
starts building their identity security strategy

792
00:29:11,338 --> 00:29:13,578
or the ones who are already having it,

793
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:15,880
where are the common pitfalls and how

794
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,858
our work with Amazon

795
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,199
has been really

796
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,699
a game changing thing in this, and I'll give you a

797
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:22,789
very quick story.

798
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,140
I, I started my reinvent in

799
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,299
2012 and that was the

800
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:27,939
year when.

801
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,709
Identity platforms were predominantly

802
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:34,108
run or used to run on-premise environments.

803
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,059
Less than 3% of identity

804
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,759
projects worldwide were successful.

805
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,900
Like, let that number sink in less than 3%

806
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,420
of identity projects used to succeed

807
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,059
worldwide, and the reason being was

808
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,380
upgrading an identity platform used to take

809
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,959
months.

810
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:51,709
But our partnership, I still remember spending my

811
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:53,858
first EC2 instance on Amazon. It was a very

812
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:54,578
proud moment

813
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:55,439
for us,

814
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:57,949
uh, taking our, our entire solution, deploying

815
00:29:57,949 --> 00:29:59,838
it on Amazon, and then

816
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,650
the customers started realizing the benefit.

817
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:05,118
You won't, you won't believe when I say that

818
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:08,140
today. It takes a few hours

819
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,400
to completely patch, upgrade,

820
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,098
and go from one version to another.

821
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,598
In 2010, this was unheard of.

822
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,539
This was practically impossible to do it.

823
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:17,890
So,

824
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:20,299
let's again talk about some of the deterrents here. If

825
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,390
you walk into a CISO's room, the first thing

826
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,689
they would be worried about is

827
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,209
how am I going to be prepared for my audits.

828
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:27,959
Every CISO

829
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:30,529
they worry about two things. One, I'm going

830
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,529
to fail my audit because I don't know what

831
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,130
I don't know.

832
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,529
And second is the amount of time

833
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:37,568
it takes to prepare for audits is

834
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,608
insanely, insanely large. The reason being

835
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,170
is your data is absolutely fragmented.

836
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:43,650
Your data is very siloed.

837
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,019
Second one is

838
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,699
even today identity security is

839
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,380
done in a way that it is often thought of

840
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:53,880
like shooting in the dark. There's a lot of guesswork

841
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,500
in this.

842
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,670
There's a lot of reactiveness to it,

843
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:58,900
and the reason again being is that

844
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,358
if you think about identity data

845
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:03,779
quality or data hygiene, it's the poorest

846
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,068
in any organization.

847
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:07,380
It has come to a state where organizations.

848
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,660
Have accepted the the status quo

849
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,400
thinking that

850
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,779
the quality of your data is never going to

851
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,858
improve and that's again where we are

852
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,939
partnering a lot with Amazon their machine

853
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:19,479
learning and their generative a

854
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,439
uh large language models

855
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,900
to help improve the data hygiene and the data

856
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,170
quality. And then the last

857
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,318
one, which is the most important one, is

858
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,969
Integration with QuickSuite, integration

859
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,390
with Amazon Q, and many other technologies

860
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,049
allows us to bridge the gap, allows us

861
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:37,890
to remove this fragmentation.

862
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,809
In fact,

863
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,410
today, if you think about every enterprise, they

864
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,529
have something around network

865
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,529
security. They have,

866
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:47,170
uh, third party products for securing

867
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,039
their endpoints,

868
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:49,848
but the only context

869
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,289
which connects what is happening across

870
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:54,009
your entire ecosystem is identity.

871
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:56,588
And that has been missing in many, many

872
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,489
organizations, which is why the

873
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,868
whole ecosystem of bridging this

874
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:03,108
gap where systems can share data

875
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:03,729
easily

876
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:06,269
becomes a very predominant player, and that's what we are working

877
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:08,689
on. So as you start

878
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:09,969
thinking about

879
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,670
uh these deterrents and you start thinking

880
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,358
about how you can craft an effective strategy

881
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,979
what's very important and I'm very very excited

882
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,209
about is the work what we are doing with QuickSuite

883
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,809
so if you take a look at what we are doing

884
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:23,969
on the very top

885
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,818
are your crown jewels, the, the most

886
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:28,910
critical, the most important applications

887
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,809
or platforms

888
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:32,118
and. Amazon Quick Suite,

889
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:34,739
to Sonali's point, they're already ingesting

890
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,559
data. They're already ingesting

891
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,180
ACLs, permissions, all of that information

892
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,559
from here. And the consumers

893
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,930
of identity platform,

894
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,279
they can interact with Savient because they

895
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,039
don't have to deal with having these point integrations.

896
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,338
Savient ingests all this data

897
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,439
from QuickSuite.

898
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:53,838
They apply identity orchestrations.

899
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,989
They apply identity context to it,

900
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,559
and then that basically allows a customer

901
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,618
to have a frictionless experience

902
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,039
when they are thinking about consuming and

903
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,160
interacting with an identity platform.

904
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
And needless to say, uh, the

905
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,598
benefits what we are seeing, and I'll give you some numbers

906
00:33:10,598 --> 00:33:13,098
here. The first one is all about,

907
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,880
uh, certification or access

908
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,390
reviews.

909
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,759
If you are not aware of what

910
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,029
an access review is,

911
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,910
think about it in this way that

912
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,519
especially in publicly trading com traded

913
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,098
companies or heavily regulated companies,

914
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
what your employees are having access

915
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,920
to or what your non-human identities

916
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,818
have access to

917
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,959
every line item has to be certified.

918
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,858
Now, multiply this

919
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:40,880
for an organization which has, let's say 55,000

920
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,338
employees. It's very common.

921
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,519
The amount of line items for

922
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,400
anybody to certify goes in the millions.

923
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:50,289
Which means that organizations spend

924
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,358
a lot of money, often millions

925
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:54,410
of dollars, to go through these access

926
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,789
reviews. Now

927
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,170
the thing what has happened over the course of the

928
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,209
period is we started seeing, and it's

929
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,289
a trend, it's a word used in identity

930
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,559
world very often, it's called rubber stamping.

931
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,890
If I'm going to give you 1700

932
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,128
line items to review that these are your

933
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,590
people who reporting to you,

934
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:14,239
go and certify their access, what's the best thing

935
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,320
you will do? You will select all, you will say this is

936
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,070
all good.

937
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:18,349
Let's go and

938
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,530
get this done with.

939
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:22,228
In publicly traded companies what happens

940
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:22,748
is

941
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:25,568
if there is something wrong it can be flagged

942
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:28,387
as a material finding which goes into your earnings

943
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:30,467
report that's the impact of

944
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,829
doing these things incorrectly.

945
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:32,728
So again,

946
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:35,688
where I was going with this is if you see

947
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,088
some of the the

948
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,829
cost savings both in terms of effort, both

949
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,829
in terms of the amount of money

950
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,907
you will spend in audit findings, etc.

951
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:45,867
it is, it is absolutely massive.

952
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,250
And that is why we are so positive, so

953
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,188
bullish about

954
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,610
these integrations.

955
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,719
Now let's talk or take a look at

956
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,378
all the things what I have spoken about. How does this

957
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,019
all things come into fruition?

958
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,789
How does this all things look practically?

959
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,360
And this is again fresh coming out of our

960
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,079
the work what we have been doing with Quick.

961
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,860
The first use case which I'm showing you here

962
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,039
is all about audit preparedness. Uh,

963
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:11,559
it's about

964
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:14,679
starting with an assessment of your entire platform

965
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:17,099
and then building what is going

966
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,360
to happen and where are the pitfalls.

967
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,340
The part which you will find here is that building

968
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,418
these assessment reports is not easy.

969
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,418
Usually organizations spend a lot of

970
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,619
money, a lot of time in hiring external

971
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:30,289
SMEs

972
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,250
who are going to collect this data from multiple

973
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,228
different systems,

974
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,619
and then they start building where exactly and

975
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:37,579
what exactly

976
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,599
the strategy

977
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,059
of your audit preparedness should look like.

978
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,019
The important part here is that when you start looking

979
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,918
at the integration with QuickSuite,

980
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,579
Quick allows us to ingest this

981
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,619
data from multiple different sources.

982
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,898
You can start talking to this data through our

983
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,619
MCP or model context

984
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:56,079
protocol interface

985
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
and rather than a human

986
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
trying to connect the dots by building

987
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,800
several different reports

988
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,139
trying to figure out where the blind spots are.

989
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,648
It all starts getting coming together in

990
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:08,809
one single way through a conversational

991
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:09,378
experience.

992
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,010
That's the power of this integration, number

993
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,119
one. Number 2 is

994
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,349
if you start looking at some of the action

995
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,360
items, how do you orchestrate, who do you

996
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,389
assign, what to do, it all starts

997
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,559
coming together, and I will show you another

998
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,719
aspect of how can we use flows

999
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,438
using this.

1000
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,148
I'll give you another example. Let's say you are on

1001
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:28,969
vacation

1002
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:31,539
and after your vacation you come back,

1003
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:33,750
let's say 10 days, 15 days, there's a bunch

1004
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,168
of requests pending in.

1005
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,128
One thing which every organization and every

1006
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:40,469
consumer of an identity platform absolutely

1007
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:42,128
hate is requesting access

1008
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,438
and approving access.

1009
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,750
And let's say if you have 37 approvals

1010
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,820
to be done. How

1011
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,349
would you know which ones to approve first?

1012
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,019
How, how would you know that if I do not approve

1013
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,059
the 36th 1 today and rather

1014
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,360
approve the first one, it's going to create

1015
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:00,250
a security gap or it's going to create a compliance

1016
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,550
issue? The interaction with

1017
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:04,780
the integration with QuickSuite allows

1018
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,869
us not only to craft a

1019
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:08,909
strategy of which ones you should be looking

1020
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:09,708
at first,

1021
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,188
but it also gives you why it should be done

1022
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:12,719
first

1023
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,070
and that is again a really game changing

1024
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,769
thing what we are looking at because

1025
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,269
it really helps as a

1026
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:21,429
smart assistant to you or you

1027
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:22,679
as a decision maker

1028
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,849
to figure out

1029
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,188
if you have a bunch of things to do which ones should

1030
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,309
you be doing first and why you should be doing

1031
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:30,389
it first. This is a very different way of

1032
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:30,949
thinking.

1033
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,349
And understanding how identity platforms

1034
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,869
behave and again we are absolutely, absolutely

1035
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:38,349
proud of our work with what and how Amazon

1036
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:39,849
has been partnering with us on this.

1037
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,469
So this is all about assessment this is all

1038
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:42,989
about

1039
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,668
consuming the information, chalking out a strategy,

1040
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,309
figuring out what to do, how to do.

1041
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:49,889
Let's take a look at another one which is something

1042
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:52,199
which is absolutely near and dear to me,

1043
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:54,188
and it's about identity orchestration.

1044
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,079
Identity orchestration is the most

1045
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,239
complex management task in any

1046
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,360
identity platform, and I'll give you an example. If

1047
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,418
you think about

1048
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,199
building an access request workflow.

1049
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,989
One of the healthcare,

1050
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,559
largest healthcare providers of

1051
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,559
North America I have been working on, when you look

1052
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,869
at their access workflow, it

1053
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,958
doesn't fit on a 49 inch ultrawide

1054
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,050
monitor. It is

1055
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,938
absolutely

1056
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,648
insane when you think about such

1057
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:24,668
complex workflows

1058
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,239
on how are you going to manage and

1059
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,550
maintain it on a day to day basis.

1060
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:31,750
And when we started looking at quick suite

1061
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,909
flows capability,

1062
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,500
what really jumped was that

1063
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,860
I think there is a time, this is the

1064
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,260
tipping point we have been waiting for where

1065
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,429
we can really alleviate these

1066
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:44,510
complex tasks and have an easy way

1067
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,628
to manage these orchestration tasks. So let's take a

1068
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:47,208
look at this.

1069
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,250
Oops

1070
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,050
So let's take a look at it. In this case,

1071
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,699
what you would find is that we start

1072
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:58,579
building an access request workflow.

1073
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:01,349
But access requests workflow should be done in such

1074
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:02,849
a way that any

1075
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:06,059
Entitlement, any permission, any

1076
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:08,090
application which I'm requesting for, and if

1077
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,458
it's of a low risk,

1078
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,148
it should not even come to me

1079
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,489
and that's where the push towards autonomous

1080
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,889
governance is going to look like.

1081
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,188
So what we are showing you here is

1082
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,898
very simple check for all the pending

1083
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:20,918
requests what you have.

1084
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,360
Look for the risk flags

1085
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,519
look for any kind of risk which is

1086
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,539
embedded into that request.

1087
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:30,030
And then make an intelligent decision

1088
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:31,289
whether it should be

1089
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,590
requiring a human in the loop to come and

1090
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,269
approve it

1091
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,429
or it should be automatically approved it

1092
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,010
and this is all done through natural

1093
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,168
language experience. You do not have to create,

1094
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,269
you do not have to manage an orchestrating

1095
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:44,969
workflow

1096
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:47,659
which again can have multiple failure points

1097
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,550
and uh

1098
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,228
it allows you.

1099
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,000
To push the boundaries, take it forward

1100
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,500
towards a human in the loop manual workflows

1101
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:57,780
towards a completely autonomous system.

1102
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,099
That's where the future is. That's where,

1103
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:02,719
uh, where we are really, really bullish on and

1104
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,699
just to give you some more stats on an average.

1105
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,619
125 applications

1106
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:09,938
exist in any enterprise.

1107
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,628
The average number of requests which flows

1108
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:15,070
into your system is 225,000

1109
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,070
to 255,000 in a month.

1110
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,889
That's what happens in

1111
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:20,349
large enterprises

1112
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:21,168
with such

1113
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:23,909
autonomous integrations

1114
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:24,489
with such

1115
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,360
risk-based approvals. What we're

1116
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,668
expecting is a 90% reduction in all

1117
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:32,030
these workflows which are going through. And

1118
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,260
again, Quick plays a very important role. Their

1119
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,889
flows is really, really promising.

1120
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:38,500
And we are really bullish on how

1121
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,708
this can completely change the paradigm

1122
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,739
of how identity security and

1123
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:43,570
governance is done,

1124
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:45,228
especially in large enterprises.

1125
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,570
So with that being said, we are again very

1126
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,159
bullish. We are thankful to Amazon for their partnership.

1127
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,750
This is just a start. We are just scratching the surface,

1128
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,590
as they say. It's day one,

1129
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,148
and we

1130
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,570
absolutely are inviting a lot of our customers,

1131
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:01,228
prospects, design partners to come

1132
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,769
and build more onto this.

1133
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,250
So I hope this was useful. Sonali, once again, thank

1134
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,909
you very much.

1135
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,269
Thank you, Babuti. Thank you so much.

1136
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:14,369
Now that you looked into

1137
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:17,039
how a application

1138
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:19,168
focused on security

1139
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:22,030
and how they have enhanced their application

1140
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,119
with Amazon Quick Suite,

1141
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:25,849

cases and how they have integrated

with Amazon Quick Suite.

1148
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,409
There are additional use cases that

1149
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:44,610

1150
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,228
