1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,299
All right, everyone, well, thank you very much for, uh,

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:05,219
for attending 1st,

3
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:06,650
1st session of the day.

4
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,919
Uh. Uh, my name is

5
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,819
Cheo Alvarez. I'm with Baker Hughes.

6
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,329
Uh, and, and this is how we're driving

7
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,060
energy forward with, uh, with,

8
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:17,600
uh, with AI technologies in

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,839
partnership with AWS.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,670
OK, so

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,489
there's a couple of points that I wanna talk on this,

12
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:29,190
just first,

13
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,568
setting the stage for what the challenges

14
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,810
that we're faced with in energy, I think

15
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,029
in large part driven by the need for

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,759
LLMs, agentic, and, and, uh,

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,189
and machine learning and the like.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:40,978
Um,

19
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,529
then we're gonna talk about how we're, how we're approaching

20
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,529
that, um, specifically with our use

21
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:46,609
and application of agentic.

22
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:49,728
And some lessons that we've learned

23
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:51,929
along the way. We've been doing this for a long time. We've

24
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,450
been introducing digital projects into the marketplace

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,569
for many, many years. Of course, Agenic is

26
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:57,200
very new,

27
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,609
but we're trying to weave those into every layer

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,810
of our stack to really accelerate

29
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,810
ourselves and our customers' ability to deploy

30
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,888
these, these types of solutions,

31
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:06,709
um,

32
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:09,849
really at scale, um, at this point.

33
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,489
So, uh,

34
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,129
a little bit about under the hood, which we're happy

35
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,329
to go into a lot more detail about, uh, uh,

36
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:17,329
kind of after the session.

37
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,829
Uh, and then looking ahead, where do we see

38
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,969
things going in the future,

39
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,909
um, and so forth, so.

40
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,189
OK, um,

41
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:30,049
so the energy industry

42
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,709
has, uh, for years

43
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,750
been chasing kind of the same vision of

44
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,849
the digital oil field.

45
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,510
Uh, the, the world's energy demands though

46
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,528
have only accelerated in the last few

47
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:42,909
years, and, and this is a statistic that amazes

48
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,870
me every time that I see it, but 165%.

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,500
Uh, anticipated growth in energy demand

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,680
is, is really just remarkable,

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,338
driven in large part due to, um,

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,909
you know, hyperscaling needs and hyperscaling

53
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,528
energy needs and

54
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,849
Uh, and, and the like. Um,

55
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,388
we have been on a journey in oil

56
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,388
and gas for acquiring

57
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:05,430
data and, and really appreciating the value

58
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,368
of data, um, at every step of our

59
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,629
operation, from, uh, from the reservoir

60
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,819
to, uh, when we drill and complete a well,

61
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,028
to, um, to how we measure that well,

62
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,139
and then the ongoing operation of that well and

63
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,129
downstream of that.

64
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,469
Um, you can see the statistics that we, we

65
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,788
generate massive amounts of information. Um,

66
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,990
15 petabytes of data coming off of a drilling

67
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,308
rig. There's 1800 drilling

68
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:29,308
rigs operating at any one time across the

69
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:29,830
world.

70
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,429
Um, and, and again, that's only the first

71
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:34,469
part of the process of just drilling the

72
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,808
well to begin with. So, um, so there's,

73
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:39,099
there's data coming from everywhere,

74
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,308
extracting signal from that noise is

75
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,508
always and forever will be the challenge.

76
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,909
Um, and, uh, but, but the

77
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,949
demand, the, the, the opportunity here is,

78
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:49,308
is massive, so.

79
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,868
Uh, if you've kind of followed the

80
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:52,409
energy industry,

81
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:53,629
um, you know,

82
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,149
when I was first growing up, the story was always

83
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:57,569
that the world is running out of oil.

84
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,129
It's actually not technically the case.

85
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,649
It's that the world is sort of running out of cheap

86
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,750
oil. And so where we've

87
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,788
risen over and over again to meet that

88
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,929
challenge is introducing new

89
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,389
physical processes to horizontally drill,

90
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,849
to hydraulically fracture, to,

91
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,149
uh, you know, deepwater exploration and

92
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,538
production. Um,

93
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,830
we will continue to do so with

94
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,979
technology. It's just now that this increasingly

95
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,069
so, the technology be, will be more digital

96
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:25,808
in nature,

97
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,649
um, hence my talk,

98
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:31,580
so. So

99
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,250
this is uh, this is a quote from McKinsey

100
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,819
about, uh, and, and I think this would

101
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,538
resonate with everybody here, how transformationally

102
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,849
agentic is going to be to every

103
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,860
industry on the planet. Um, it, it's going

104
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,979
to transform every enterprise operations

105
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,058
and, in my opinion, it's gonna make work a

106
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,139
lot more interesting as I can delegate

107
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,258
my menial task to, uh, to

108
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:52,849
an agent,

109
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,080
uh, so that I can then focus on something,

110
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,750
you know, more creative, higher value added,

111
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,258
uh, and so forth.

112
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,919
Where we see this impacting, this is again very

113
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,819
high level, but 33% of

114
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,439
enterprise software,

115
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,038
uh, will include some shape of agentic

116
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,080
by 2028, again driving

117
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,819
energy demands.

118
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:17,298
15% of work decisions will be made

119
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,220
by Agentic in 2028. Uh,

120
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,040
over a billion agents are going to be created and deployed

121
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,079
to varying degrees of quality, and, and this is.

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,838
Where we see Baker Hughes,

123
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:27,619
the quality of our agents,

124
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,139
uh, uh, that's really gonna be the competitive

125
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,199
advantage that we see for Baker Hughes and our

126
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,238
ability to help our energy customers going

127
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:34,769
forward,

128
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,019
um, because

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,899
garbage in, garbage out,

130
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,750
um, we have a lot of deep domain expertise

131
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,709
that we need to apply and bring to our,

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,540
bring to our agents, so.

133
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,798
Where we have been specifically the

134
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,220
technology area that I work in.

135
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,798
It's called Lucia

136
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,220
and

137
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,759
So Lucipa, let me talk a little bit about

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
the digital technology program

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,439
that I'm a part of, um,

140
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,639
for, because we have been on this journey for years,

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,759
um, and the journey that we're on right

142
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,838
now with Agenic is the same journey

143
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,858
that we've taken from day one

144
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:14,778
with the digital oil fields, so.

145
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,709
The beginning step of the process for us was

146
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,970
we needed to be able to get access to

147
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:20,769
data,

148
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,769
garbage in, garbage out.

149
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,108
I've heard from every person I've talked to

150
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,209
here, get access to and contextualize

151
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:27,790
that data,

152
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,309
then. Add workflows, automate

153
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,470
workflows, so work with our customers

154
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,459
to understand what their processes are,

155
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,949
what the data selections and technology

156
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,108
choices that they made, the modeling tools that they

157
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,108
use, and, and how they apply those to their

158
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,069
business processes.

159
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:44,389
Um, and, and I'm trying to be very high level

160
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,750
here without using too much industry jargon, but,

161
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,048
um, I, I, I again think that that's very,

162
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,619
very. Analogous across all industries.

163
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,649
We want to introduce then automation,

164
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,238
again, sort of respecting our customers'

165
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,290
technology choices and business processes,

166
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,759
so that we can eventually deliver some type of an outcome.

167
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,639
Um, we've been doing this since, you know, early 2000s,

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,939
first with physics-based,

169
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,439
kind of classical techniques. We've then layered

170
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,559
in, uh, uh, machine learning

171
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,980
and AI type models,

172
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,278
uh, and, and now we're adding agentic

173
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:15,600
and weaving agentic through every piece of this,

174
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,139
uh, of this stack as well,

175
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:24,350
so. Real

176
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,389
world application of AI, um, of

177
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,048
agentic,

178
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,509
um, so agentic enterprise software,

179
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,629
we're, we, we, we're taking very much

180
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,629
the same approach that I think everyone is. We're,

181
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,988
we're introducing orchestration, centralized

182
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:36,809
orchestration.

183
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,298
And uh where where I think our real

184
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,298
differentiator is, is again the quality of

185
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:43,540
our individual agents, the orchestration

186
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,879
agents, you know, largely sort of generic,

187
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,579
um, but where we differentiate is in our architecture

188
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,738
and how we approach these things, and, and the

189
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,920
quality of our individual agents themselves,

190
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,500
which we've basically taken Lucipa

191
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,738
capabilities, wrapped them up as individual

192
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,819
agents, and then contextualize them

193
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,250
so that, uh, so that.

194
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:03,119
In oil and gas, uh,

195
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,819
you know, you have a reservoir that that's 2 miles

196
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,420
beneath you, extending for some,

197
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,769
you know, miles into the distance every which way.

198
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,809
You have no means of actually measuring

199
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:13,730
what is going on under the earth.

200
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,069
So everything for us is an approximation

201
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,170
of the truth. It's uh you have a near well bore,

202
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,420
which you can measure. You have some

203
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,678
kind of mathematical ways of approximating

204
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,178
what happens very far away from the reservoir

205
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:25,920
in the well,

206
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,298
um. We need agents that have

207
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:30,338
some awareness of, of what the, what the

208
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,420
accuracy of their, of their prediction of

209
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,459
that you're always measuring the the

210
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,459
same value, but

211
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,899
you approach it in different ways. You need a, a

212
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,559
contextualized agent that understands the uncertainty

213
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,939
and the quality of the model that it used to

214
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:43,660
arrive at that

215
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:44,778
approximation.

216
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,399
This is where we're really spending a lot of our,

217
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,639
our time and focus.

218
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,769
OK, so.

219
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,899
We have our foundational

220
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,858
capabilities that that we call LIPA.

221
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:03,278
This is our physics-based models, classical

222
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,139
correlations, uh,

223
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,059
uh, that, that we apply.

224
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,920
Uh, you know, the oil industry has really

225
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,379
followed and, and followed along with

226
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,540
the sort of uh adoption of computing in

227
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,290
general, so,

228
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,939
uh, we have very simple plotting functions

229
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,970
to then as, as CPUs

230
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,470
became very prevalent, we had reservoir simulation

231
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,540
and, and nodal analysis and,

232
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,480
and ways of iteratively

233
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,588
calculating.

234
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,069
Uh, and, and simulating different things,

235
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,798
um, machine learning,

236
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:34,369
heavy adoption of machine learning across our

237
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:35,469
industry, and now again,

238
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,928
uh, we're, we're wrapping, wrapping all

239
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,399
these up and packaging them as agentic

240
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,529
into the shape of which you can see here is

241
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,349
the, you know.

242
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,779
It, it, it's presented as a chatbot

243
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:49,058
because this is the most comfortable user interface

244
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,109
that, that you can present to an end user.

245
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,460
Um, but behind the scenes, what's happening is,

246
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,340
is Lucy,

247
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,298
Lucia.

248
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,408
Uh, Lucy is calling onto all of Lucia's

249
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,000
various agents that we provide,

250
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,500
um, and contextualizing them so that we

251
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,700
can, again, reduce signal to noise

252
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,658
and, and present the right

253
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,259
context and call on the right agent

254
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,418
at the right time to service the right, to

255
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,788
surface the right recommendation to, um,

256
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,000
to our end users.

257
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,869
Uh, and, uh, so, so you can

258
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:18,969
see here, um,

259
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:22,149
everything builds on top of each other. So Lucia's

260
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:24,178
ability to go out and connect to data,

261
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:25,769
contextualize that data,

262
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:29,109
work with our customer stack in whatever

263
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,250
shape or, or tools they might have chosen,

264
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,830
whether that's on premise, whether they've,

265
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,219
uh, heavily leaned into SAS and cloud

266
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,308
technologies. We really need to be prepared

267
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,168
to meet customers wherever they are.

268
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,219
Um,

269
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,678
so, uh, you know, both on premise

270
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:45,820
and, and in the cloud, and all of this

271
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,899
is with the intention of, uh, of avoiding

272
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,298
just nonsensical recommendations

273
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,298
that are just adding more noise when, when

274
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:54,509
we're meant to be extracting more, more signal

275
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:59,500
from. OK,

276
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,178
so, so this is where I think we start to differentiate

277
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:04,178
is in our architectural approach, and

278
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,080
this is, again,

279
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,298
you know, it's a sort of forward looking architecture

280
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,080
but rooted in our histories. So,

281
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,739
uh, you know, the, the sort of gravity

282
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,889
of information, on the left hand

283
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,058
side we have the energy operator, our customer.

284
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
On the right hand side we have Baker Hughes

285
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,389
and our, and our digital platform Lucia.

286
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:25,658
The energy operator has, has a wealth of

287
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,820
information from all the different tools and, and

288
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,788
applications that they use.

289
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,149
They have their business processes that they flow

290
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:31,668
through.

291
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,190
Um, they have their, uh, their, their

292
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,308
particular operation that they apply these to,

293
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,609
and, and it's, it's very heterogene,

294
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,950
heterogeneous in the sense that,

295
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,349
um, every field that a

296
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:45,428
customer operates is generally different when

297
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:46,969
we go to talk to a customer.

298
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,859
We give them a demo of our software, they say,

299
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:51,690
OK, well test validation,

300
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,190
what you would imagine is a very generalized

301
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,690
process, standardized across the

302
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,950
industry. We start getting into the details

303
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,710
of how they do it, and they say that's,

304
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:02,590
you know, uh, that, that,

305
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,798
that's,

306
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,149
that looks nice, it's not how we do things here.

307
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,389
So what, what we very quickly took away

308
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,308
from that was that we need flexibility.

309
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,379
Uh,

310
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:13,879
across every side of this, and, and that's what

311
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,058
this architecture affords us is, is

312
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,558
really the flexibility of adapting

313
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,320
our agents very quickly to

314
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,849
the customer's choices and data sources,

315
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:25,000
the customer's choices and tools, and then standing

316
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,119
up some, some magentic protocols in

317
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,428
between so that each side can surface

318
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:30,769
what the other is providing,

319
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,080
and, uh, and then call orchestration

320
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,599
agents on each side to

321
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,269
um to both introduce uh

322
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,009
uh tools.

323
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,690
Agents and tools, as well as humans in the loop

324
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,729
to validate the response of those agents

325
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:43,349
and tools,

326
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,879
um, as they communicate back and forth. So,

327
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,320
we really view agents as a partner,

328
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,519
as a teammate here,

329
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,769
not as a, not as, not as a displacement

330
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:54,808
of human capital, but really as, as an

331
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,048
extension of human capital, right?

332
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,080
So,

333
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,099
to, to zoom in and get very practical

334
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,259
in what one of these use cases looks

335
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:05,840
like,

336
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:08,229
um. We

337
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,320
may have a customer who's chosen chosen

338
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,428
a particular flavor of reservoir

339
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,989
monitoring agent. It could be coming from a physics-based

340
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,190
tool, machine learning-based tool, but,

341
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,469
but that's, that reservoir monitoring agent

342
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:21,250
could be coming from a, from simple

343
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,950
surveillance of, of tags

344
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,029
coming off of a wellhead.

345
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,190
That reservoir monitoring agent should be,

346
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
should be tuned to uh to

347
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,479
specific conditions.

348
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,538
So in this case we're we're describing

349
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,200
a rising oil water contact, which if

350
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,460
we get too much water

351
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,038
encroaching into a well, we're going to forever

352
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,080
damage the well and produce far

353
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,479
more water than we than we want to over

354
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,639
the life of that well, and we will have effectively lost

355
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,298
the well. So

356
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:49,678
we'll have this reservoir monitoring agent running

357
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,918
on the customer side or on the Baker Hughes

358
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:54,440
side, but it's running in the background observing.

359
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:57,219
And when it sees some type of an event start to happen,

360
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,599
that it knows that we can influence with

361
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,440
another agent,

362
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,918
it will call out to Baker Hughes' specialist

363
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:05,259
agent. Baker Hughes, we, we really specialize

364
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,469
in, in manufacture and design of,

365
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,918
of pumps, of electric submersible

366
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:11,840
pumps, so they're these pumps that exist

367
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,269
2 miles under the, under the ground at the

368
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,389
bottom of the, at the bottom of the well bore.

369
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,168
And so we have various simulators that we can use

370
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,168
to predict, OK, I want to arrive at

371
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,408
what is the, what is the optimal pump

372
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:24,750
frequency or speed

373
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,649
or liquid production that I'm gonna produce

374
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,969
through that pump, so that I don't damage my reservoir.

375
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,820
And so it typically involves in typically

376
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,168
that would result in a, in, in, in a decrease

377
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:36,489
or slowing down that pump.

378
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,928
So Baker Hughes, uh, you know, our agentic

379
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,129
models make that recommendation of what we need

380
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,168
to decrease to, and then this

381
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,210
is where it starts to get very important for our

382
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,288
industry. So, in the, in the

383
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,428
application of AI and agentic specifically

384
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,190
to heavy industry,

385
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,450
um, we really need to lean hard into

386
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,668
having human in the loop, validated

387
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,178
recommendations by specialists who

388
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,729
understand the physical principles behind what these

389
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,869
agents are recommending.

390
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:05,678
Um, so we, we might have our agent

391
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,798
make a recommendation, but the quality of that

392
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,048
recommendation is gonna be wholly dictated by

393
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,239
the model that it's called on, the quality of the

394
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,418
data going into it.

395
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,399
And so our human in the loop just valid, validates

396
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,739
the sanity checks for it,

397
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:20,038
um, and before sending that then

398
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,279
back to the customer, right? So this is a service

399
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,219
that we provide.

400
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:24,340
Uh,

401
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,058
we send that recommendation back to the customer.

402
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,048
We are then passing that,

403
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,609
that customer is then validating with their own

404
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:36,009
human in the loop, the production engine engineer

405
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,099
who Baker is not able to in all cases

406
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,038
act on that recommendation itself. With

407
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,690
some customers want us to provide that

408
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,690
service, others want us to introduce their own

409
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,509
human in the loop.

410
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,418
Um,

411
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:49,369
so, it will, it will generally be validated

412
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:51,428
by, uh, their production engineer

413
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:53,928
on, on, uh, uh, you know, an employee

414
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:54,469
of theirs,

415
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,928
uh, who will approve our recommendation coming

416
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,349
from our subject matter expert.

417
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,869
Uh, and then they will then push

418
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,168
that recommendation out to an edge device.

419
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,469
Um, you know, we, we've really instrumented all of

420
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,548
our wellheads, uh, these days, so we

421
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,739
can push that recommendation out to an edge

422
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,950
device without necessarily needing to send somebody

423
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,548
out there to actually make that change physically

424
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,590
themselves. So this is, and, and then the cycle

425
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,609
just repeats. So then the reservoir,

426
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,389
uh, monitoring agent will go back to observing,

427
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,830
verify that the, that the pumps

428
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,450
change,

429
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,830
actually had the impact that we expected it

430
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,029
to. And uh the

431
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:29,869
process continues.

432
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:30,889
And, and

433
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,869
we have so many different agents and calculators

434
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,908
and ways of approximating truth

435
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:38,428
and, and, and quantifying uncertainty

436
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,590
that that this is a really sort of

437
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,788
generalized, this is one particular process, but

438
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,908
it really scales well and, and can be

439
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,979
generalized to so much of what it is that

440
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,889
we do because.

441
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,629
How do you break up a complex system? You, you,

442
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,558
you break it up into small little parts.

443
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,879
We have many agents solving each small

444
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,580
part of this.

445
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:58,080
And uh the orchestration, the higher level

446
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,940
optimizer of optimizers or, or orchestration

447
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,960
agent is really just making

448
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,940
everything work better

449
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,038
together. So

450
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,340
what we have learned through this, um,

451
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,149
and, and it's been very much the same learnings

452
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,250
that we've had since, since when we started doing

453
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,440
this in, in AI and ML and agentic

454
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,759
tools, uh, uh, you know, we're, we're

455
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,830
not really, uh, you know, we're really not

456
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,918
widely prevalent. So data quality

457
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,399
is everything, whether you're doing this with physics

458
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,070
models,

459
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,399
calculations, algebraic kind

460
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,599
of correlations, the quality of the data is

461
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,649
the foundation that, that you stand on.

462
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,029
Uh, the user experience, and

463
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:39,629
as we introduce more and more, you know, what, what

464
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,750
are perceived to be black boxes, uh,

465
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,070
the explainability of any recommendation.

466
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,629
Uh, or, or opportunity that we surface

467
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,029
is absolutely key. We have, uh,

468
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,308
you know, we have our users are, are

469
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,340
highly technical specialists who have

470
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,178
spent years,

471
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,989
um,

472
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,469
understanding like first principle physics

473
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,859
of how this pump works, of how this reservoir

474
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,548
behaves, of how to numerically, analytically

475
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,630
solve these kind of solutions. So we need

476
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,709
to be able to very, very at a very

477
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,670
low level explain, um.

478
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,318
Uh, how it, how it is that we arrived at any

479
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,318
particular recommendation. That was, that was something

480
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,400
that we were told from day one as we tested

481
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
the, the agentic concept with people.

482
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,439
It's just explainability to me is

483
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,028
everything. Um, adaptability.

484
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,388
So across the, you know, we use this term

485
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:27,667
heterogeneity to describe our reservoirs.

486
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:30,009
We have heterogeneous

487
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,028
organizations as well.

488
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:33,667
Every customer chooses different tools, different

489
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,708
data stacks, um, different

490
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,128
approaches, different business processes. Their,

491
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,468
their fields are all different. We need to be

492
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:42,628
prepared to meet them wherever they are,

493
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,288
um, on their own digital transformation

494
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:45,827
journey.

495
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,390
Um, and, and we work with customers, not

496
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,420
just in, in North American land obviously,

497
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:52,588
but, but global customers around the

498
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,630
world, um, will all be at different

499
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,949
stages of their digitalization, uh, kind of

500
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:59,150
process. And, and then the last bit

501
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,209
is governance and cost.

502
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,078
Uh, so

503
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,479
how to govern these things. HS&E again,

504
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,630
heavy, heavy industry has,

505
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,289
you know, disastrous consequences

506
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,509
of the wrong recommendation being made

507
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,170
because it's based on faulty data or stale

508
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,199
models or the like, and, uh,

509
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,328
and, and really putting

510
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,449
the guardrails in place based on Baker

511
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,449
Hughes's expertise is, is really one of the

512
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,529
areas that we, that we think we bring the most

513
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,318
value to our, to our customers,

514
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,739
so. What

515
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,959
makes it work, um, a lot of the familiar

516
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,338
AWS technologies that we know and love

517
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:36,500
and have heard announced and presented about

518
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,910
today, there, there's a, an open source

519
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,328
project that I want to highlight here called Energy Agents,

520
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,539
which is, uh, which is something that AWS

521
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,239
sponsors,

522
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,650
uh, and has released. You can go check it out on

523
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,818
GitHub. Um, so it, it shows

524
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:49,559
a lot of the same,

525
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:52,299
uh, techniques that we apply ourselves internally.

526
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:53,640
We build on these things,

527
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,979
uh, you know, data management, of course,

528
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,180
and then again, guard rails, which I've, which

529
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,858
I've mentioned.

530
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,920
So Um,

531
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:04,939
looking ahead,

532
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,598
again, this is where we look to

533
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:09,598
is very much again anchored in our past

534
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,779
of, uh, of

535
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,959
connecting to, contextualizing data,

536
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:14,858
uh,

537
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:17,640
you know, describing and working with customers

538
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,219
to describe their workflows,

539
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,799
automating manual processes powered by

540
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,818
these agents, and then of course using that to really

541
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:25,818
drive some type of an like an impactful

542
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:26,640
outcome.

543
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,539
Uh, where we have been doing this manually

544
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,848
with our, with our implementation

545
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:34,098
engineers, with our developers creating

546
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,420
these types of tools. We,

547
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:36,309
you know, I'm,

548
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:38,660
I'm speaking specifically about our

549
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,828
customer facing

550
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:43,410
LuciPA application today, but, but this is what's helping,

551
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,529
we see Agentic really is what's helping

552
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:48,098
us to really massively adopt

553
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,519
at scale the, the.

554
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,930
The technologies that we have developed over the

555
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,930
years, um, but are much harder

556
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,390
to roll out at scale when

557
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,170
knowing the level of tuning and customization

558
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,019
that's needed to really bring this to an asset.

559
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,920
So weaving agentic into how we onboard

560
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,989
our customers to then how we tailor our

561
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:07,328
workflows and, and adapt them to a particular

562
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:07,949
customer

563
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,489
need and then turn, create

564
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,604
a. And turn those over to customers so

565
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,074
that they can then in turn use themselves.

566
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,674
Um, it's really going to be the, the game

567
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,693
changer we believe in and what's going to

568
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:21,285
allow us to to really digitize this

569
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,193
operation at scale.

570
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,785
Um, we think it's going to be powered by, uh,

571
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,314
we think it's really gonna be

572
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:29,213
possible with uh and maybe

573
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:31,594
for the first time ever with agentic so.

574
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:35,049
I think with that, I am very much at

575
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,420
time and

576
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,959
perfectly on time, so thank you very much.

577
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,098
Um, and we'll be happy to answer any

578
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,000
questions, um,

579
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,568
we'll be hovering around there somewhere, so, thank you very

580
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:44,858
much.
