1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,449
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:03,568
Thank you for coming here for

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,118
ARC 310, Resilience

4
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:07,400
of AWS Cloud.

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,189
Uh, my name's Rob Charlton. I'm a principal

6
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:12,310
technologist focused on resilience in

7
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,108
the financial services business unit.

8
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:15,300
And

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,638
Uh, hi.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,958
Hi, Rob, thank you. Uh, thank you for coming as

11
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,158
well. Uh, I know it's a little bit early, maybe

12
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:22,920
it's very late, depending on your time zone.

13
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:25,429
Uh, but, uh, my name's Stephen,

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,079
Steve Martin. I'm a,

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,638
uh, I'm a technologist at AWS and I

16
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,818
run a team of, uh, security

17
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:32,859
and, uh,

18
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,630
compliance specialists, uh, basically

19
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,043
everything outside of the. US for financial services.

20
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,554
And we're delighted to be here today to

21
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:41,774
talk to you about resiliency.

22
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,325
So we're gonna talk about the resilience of AWS

23
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,804
and many of you in the audience might already know

24
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,884
quite a lot about resilience of AWS, like what a

25
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:49,554
region is,

26
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,965
but hopefully today, even if you know

27
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,115
all that, you're gonna learn something as well.

28
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,444
So what we would say is,

29
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:56,764
although you may know it,

30
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,125
this technique that we're going to present today has proved

31
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,243
very effective. If you have to explain

32
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:03,524
some of that to your stakeholders. So if someone on the board

33
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:05,543
comes to say, well, how is AWS resilient?

34
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,010
This technique works pretty well we found

35
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,349
in terms of explaining that.

36
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,930
So, but first, quick show of hands, how many people have

37
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,969
had enough of PowerPoint, this reinvent?

38
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,849
And we've been watching PowerPoint continuously. Right, good

39
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,650
news, we are ditching the PowerPoint.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,308
Yes, no PowerPoints.

41
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,120
So we're going to old fashioned organic

42
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,159
gluten-free iPad and Apple

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,469
pencil. So

44
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,409
We're gonna talk about resilience of AWS, but I'm gonna

45
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,829
start with a little bit of a digression

46
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,489
on what is resilience and how do we

47
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,719
think about it. Now we found

48
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,879
this very useful in terms of explaining

49
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,299
resilience, it's what I call the resilience equation.

50
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,819
I'm gonna come back to this

51
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,698
because

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,278
in talking to lots of customers and talking to

53
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:51,739
financial regulators and other people around the world,

54
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,359
I came to realize that often

55
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,558
there's another resilience equation in mind

56
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,588
when we're having resilience conversations, cos they're

57
00:01:58,588 --> 00:01:59,219
always saying.

58
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,698
What about data centers burning down and undersea

59
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:02,689
cables being cut,

60
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,180
which absolutely these are things that can happen

61
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,180
and you need to be able to take account of that, but

62
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,439
there's a lot more to resilience besides that.

63
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,319
So I call this the classic resilience equation,

64
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,199
and it got me thinking, well why,

65
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:16,960
why is that? Why is there this focus on

66
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,639
a more traditional view of resilience?

67
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,808
And here's my view. See if you agree with this, but

68
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,240
I think this comes down to the fact that the way

69
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,508
things fail have changed, and this is nothing

70
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:28,649
to do with cloud whatsoever.

71
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,788
This is a change in how we build

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,610
applications that's been happening over the last 1520

73
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,710
years. So if you think about a,

74
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,069
a traditional application that you might build

75
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,189
for resilience,

76
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:42,008
usually the way you'd build that er in the past

77
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:44,129
is in a monolithic style, so

78
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:44,969
you have one.

79
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,399
Giant application.

80
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,618
Running as a monolith on some piece of

81
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,618
hardware and then for resilience you might have

82
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,819
another copy of it running tens of kilometers

83
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,139
away in another data center.

84
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,000
And the resilience model of this is

85
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,889
Is very simple because if one of them fails,

86
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,080
then the other one takes over.

87
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,199
But the way that we're building things now has changed.

88
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,099
Nowadays teams are usually using

89
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,038
Kubernetes or containers, technologies

90
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,580
and building things in a microservices

91
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,618
style, so instead of that monolith you've got this

92
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,439
network of lots of little services

93
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:21,099
all connected together and then all built on top of cloud

94
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:21,719
services.

95
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,080
But this has some important implications.

96
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,740
So let's think about what happens to an application when

97
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,558
it goes wrong in both cases.

98
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,679
So first off, let's look at the monolithic app

99
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,778
and imagine we're plotting a graph here of

100
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,028
traffic reaching this application, this could be any

101
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:40,118
kind of business application, and here over 24

102
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:42,240
hours you can see there's a big peak in traffic

103
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,099
in the middle of the day.

104
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,838
Now imagine something's gone wrong.

105
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,149
So, uh, sometime here maybe a

106
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:50,449
certificate's expired,

107
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,159
and because it's monolithic,

108
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,770
an application has gone down

109
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:56,300
completely and there's a two hour period where it's just

110
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,088
off, no traffic being received.

111
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,330
And then the engineers come in, they fix it.

112
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,050
Now this is a very,

113
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,389
very easy model to understand and reason

114
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,389
about, and the availability is quite

115
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,069
simple to calculate. You can see we've got 19 of availability

116
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,008
over the day there.

117
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,729
But what happens in the,

118
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,028
the new model?

119
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,189
So now we've got our microservices app.

120
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,858
Same, running the same business

121
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,928
application, same traffic occurring during the day, and

122
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,629
what happens when something fails here?

123
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,428
Now you can see

124
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,028
this model is slightly different because

125
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,189
around about here,

126
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,269
something starts going wrong.

127
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,769
But because it's not one big thing, because

128
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,889
it's a network of microservices, maybe one

129
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,028
microservice is

130
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,769
failing or maybe there's just extra latency

131
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,160
between a couple of services.

132
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,738
The application is not 100% down, so

133
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,838
a proportion of requests that are

134
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:49,939
reaching that application

135
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:51,000
start to fail.

136
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:54,259
And then you can see a bit later, after

137
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,559
a couple of hours, the team implies a fix,

138
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,759
traffic starts increasing again,

139
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,428
and then around here we're back up to full recovery

140
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,790
again. But already you can see

141
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,269
something's a bit different with this graph now because

142
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,889
you could say, well, at no point during that 24

143
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,298
hours was the app 100% down.

144
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,209
So how do you even reason about

145
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:14,928
up or down, and then.

146
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,350
What about availability? How do you calculate the availability

147
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,528
now? So one way you could do that is you could say,

148
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,250
Let's take the area here.

149
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,720
And divide that by

150
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,528
the area of the rest of the graph, and then you get a

151
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,778
calculation of success rate

152
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:31,579
for that application.

153
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,189
That relies on knowing what this dotted line

154
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,009
is here,

155
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:38,970
so you need to know what is the expected traffic hitting your

156
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,278
application. But you can see,

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,769
taking a step back,

158
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,230
this is a lot more complicated to reason

159
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,088
about, it's not so straightforward.

160
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,670
Then think about the team supporting this.

161
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,149
They're gonna have to have

162
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,569
better observability skills, better

163
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,879
tooling to be able to work out what is going on to

164
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,920
understand that it's this particular microservice that's

165
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,670
having a problem.

166
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,209
And then recovery might not be as simple as going into

167
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,528
the data center and rebooting one of the,

168
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,850
one of the servers or a rack.

169
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:05,709
So

170
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,619
my theory is failure has changed and that

171
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,309
impacts

172
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,009
the way things fail, and that means

173
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,548
there's more boxes in my resilience equation.

174
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,889
So let's run through this.

175
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,509
What I'd say is

176
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:22,449
So although I spent all that time saying that

177
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,970
global infrastructure is not the main focus,

178
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,509
when it comes to the resilience of an application, I'm saying

179
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,540
it's a sum of all of these things,

180
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:30,730
and along the bottom row

181
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:33,069
is all the bits that AWS does. And

182
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,149
it starts with a global infrastructure, so, and

183
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:37,088
that's what we're gonna talk about today is

184
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:38,608
data centers,

185
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,470
cables, networking,

186
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,488
racks, power, storage.

187
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,189
Where, where does all that go and how do we think about that

188
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,048
when we're building it.

189
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,250
But Application

190
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,899
engineers building cloud

191
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,290
services, building digital services running

192
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,170
on cloud and not using that infrastructure

193
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,209
directly, they're not going into our data centers and

194
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,119
putting things in there.

195
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,428
They're using AWS services.

196
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,209
But then what is an AWS service? An

197
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,548
AWS service

198
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,889
is a distributed software

199
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,389
application that gives access to that infrastructure.

200
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,040
So the engineers are building on services, therefore,

201
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,608
the way that we build and design those services,

202
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,928
the the way that our teams think about resilience

203
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,230
is also a key part of the resilience story.

204
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,278
This also helps you ask better questions

205
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,939
about AWS resilience, because really

206
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,639
you can ask questions about the infrastructure, but

207
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,920
better to ask questions about well what's the resilience of the

208
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,858
services that are running on that infrastructure.

209
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,988
But then lastly,

210
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,928
those services are run by dedicated

211
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:38,928
teams of people, single threaded teams, and we'll

212
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:40,928
talk a little bit about those teams as well

213
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,108
today. But the way that those teams

214
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,149
operate the service, the kind of practices and

215
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,389
mechanisms that they have,

216
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,910
the way that they work is also

217
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,369
a key part of the resilience story.

218
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,350
So that's the whole bottom row, that's all

219
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,470
the stuff that AWS does on your behalf,

220
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,649
and you don't need to do anything to enable

221
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,970
that. That all just happens by default, but

222
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,970
it's very important that you're able to

223
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,250
understand and articulate that, particularly

224
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,290
if someone on the board has come to you to say,

225
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,000
well, how does this resilience work,

226
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,488
then being able to explain all of those

227
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:12,559
boxes is a part of your resilience

228
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,838
story. But

229
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,059
it's not all down to us.

230
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,928
So the top row is all the bit that's

231
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:19,879
your responsibility.

232
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,879
And it starts with your architecture.

233
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,108
So which AOS services have you picked?

234
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,410
How are you composing them together, what choices

235
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,100
have you made?

236
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,790
Maybe you're working with an AOS solutions architect

237
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,288
who's helping guide you with that.

238
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,408
You might be using the AOS well architected framework,

239
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,269
uh, so condensed knowledge of 19

240
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,849
years of running AWS and working with customers,

241
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,418
compressed into a number of different pillars,

242
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,548
one of which is the reliability pillar giving you

243
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:47,529
guidance on how to build for resilience.

244
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,869
But as you just saw,

245
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:53,389
because the way applications are built

246
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:54,359
is changing,

247
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,210
the way that you design your software is also

248
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,250
important. So it's important that

249
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,330
the software engineers in your teams are also part

250
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,330
of this resilience conversation. They can't just

251
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,830
leave it to the infrastructure team

252
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,389
or the architects anymore.

253
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,869
So we have some more guidance available.

254
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,158
There's a resource called the Amazon Builders

255
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,200
Library, where we've put a lot of our secret

256
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,340
sauce in how to build distributed

257
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,500
software applications over the last 20

258
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,340
years that we've been building AWS

259
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,739
and that's all available for you to use as well.

260
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,658
Then lastly, and I think most importantly.

261
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,519
Once you've deployed your applications into

262
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,389
AWS,

263
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,989
you have to keep them running and keep them resilient,

264
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,168
and that's where your operations

265
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:34,750
teams

266
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:36,668
come into, come into play.

267
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:37,950
So what

268
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,629
processes and practices

269
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:42,450
do they operate? How are they deploying the software,

270
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,798
how are they monitoring it?

271
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,308
What incident response procedures have they got?

272
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,369
When there is an incident and afterwards

273
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,090
when they're doing the root cause analysis,

274
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:53,538
how do they perform that and how do they extract

275
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:55,359
the maximum amount of learning possible

276
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,779
and then build that in as part of your resilience

277
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,320
life cycle.

278
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,700
So what I would say is all of

279
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,239
this

280
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:04,580
goes towards making you resilient while you're running

281
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,599
on AWS.

282
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,099
It's a shared responsibility model. The

283
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,099
top row is down to you and your engineers and

284
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,918
we'll go into that as we go through

285
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,538
the er the talk today. The bottom bit

286
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,820
comes from AWS.

287
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:18,629
So,

288
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,678
before we get into the global infrastructure,

289
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,739
Let's talk a little bit about

290
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,389
the risks that AWS thinks about. Thank you very much, Mr.

291
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,250
Rob. Really

292
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,869
useful

293
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,678
to start thinking about risks and how

294
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,639
AWS helps you address these risks.

295
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,649
What we find is

296
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,048
in a lot of, a lot of the conversations

297
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:41,509
that we're having with our customers, they're struggling

298
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:42,950
with explaining

299
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:45,529
uh how AWS is actually managing

300
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,389
these risks.

301
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,769
And then there's a lot of overfocus on

302
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:51,099
areas that perhaps you don't need to focus on,

303
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,609
which takes your resources away from what you

304
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,849
should be doing, which is that top part of the equation.

305
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:58,548
And so what we want to do is we want to help you

306
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:01,149
today to understand how to articulate

307
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,029
to people that

308
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,460
you're perhaps working with or you know,

309
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:06,349
talk to your leadership,

310
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,649
um, some of you might be leaders here.

311
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,168
How to really frame this so that

312
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,139
you are really comfortable of explaining

313
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,590
why you're gonna focus on that top piece of the equation

314
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,048
rather than focusing on

315
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,629
the infrastructure. You know, we see a lot of customers, we, we

316
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,229
came from financial services.

317
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,149
Background, uh,

318
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:25,590
and so therefore

319
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,928
there's a sort of a governmental or regulatory kind

320
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:29,869
of focus on these questions as well,

321
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,288
um, so this is where this came from and I

322
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:34,830
think thinking about it from a risk point of view is very helpful.

323
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,489
And so when we, uh, when we think

324
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,609
about let's say if we go back to this like where do we

325
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,690
put our data centers when we build our

326
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,349
region,

327
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,668
uh, we really sit there and we think about,

328
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,009
uh, the kind of environmental risks

329
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:47,830
that may come up.

330
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,460
And I, I think uh there's a lot of people here from all parts

331
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,479
of the world, so, you know, uh, sadly

332
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,500
not everywhere is

333
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,859
immune to these things, right? And you know if you

334
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,859
take India for example, you know, it has a seismic

335
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,769
plane and you know you have to think about these things,

336
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,418
and we actually invest in two different regions to handle

337
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,500
that. So you know, you think about earthquakes, you

338
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,210
can't always avoid those situations,

339
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
but we build our data centers and we build our

340
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,558
environments to handle

341
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,989
uh the kind of pressures that might bring.

342
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:14,440
Uh, you know, Japan for example as well.

343
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,639
Uh, we think about flooding.

344
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,830
You know, we think about flood plains. These are, these are important

345
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,048
things, you know, you go buy a house, you think about, well, is

346
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:21,969
there a river nearby?

347
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,750
We think about these things too.

348
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,428
Uh, we think about

349
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,969
other environmental factors that we can't predict these

350
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,210
days, you know, the world's changing.

351
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,750
So you have, you know, you've seen what happened in

352
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,590
Indonesia recently, which is a bit sad,

353
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,928
where you have, uh, you know, like a,

354
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,308
a year's flooding in, in almost a week.

355
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,000
So we think about those things as well.

356
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,599
And then we think about

357
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,599
uh

358
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,918
other things, right?

359
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,340
Uh we think about uh the

360
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,879
physical

361
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,918
threats that you're that you're under. Now,

362
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:53,149
a lot of us.

363
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,298
Especially someone my age,

364
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:56,820
I come from an environment where

365
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,479
we actually used to build the data centers and run them

366
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,558
ourselves and put the racks in and think

367
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,678
about these uh more physical areas.

368
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:06,759
And for some, you know, more and more, you know, people

369
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,320
who are born in the cloud or companies that are born in the cloud

370
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,259
may not think about these things, but we do.

371
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,879
So we insulate you from as

372
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,099
much as possible from

373
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,558
servers crashing,

374
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,460
you know, fiber getting cut,

375
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,798
fire suppression,

376
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:22,298
cooling failures, power failures.

377
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:25,058
And you know we do that through

378
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,479
thinking about redundancy in

379
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,519
the way that we build our data centers and

380
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,538
also providing additional redundancy

381
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,200
when we come, we get to explain this when we think

382
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
about how we put our ASEs together and

383
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,548
how we build our regions

384
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,239
and then you know we think about one of the things that I'm really

385
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,580
passionate about AWS

386
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:42,859
is security

387
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,058
uh because I'm responsible for quite a bit with my customers

388
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,048
and

389
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,359
we really focus on uh.

390
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,080
Uh, security in our

391
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,918
organization, we put security first. Um,

392
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,279
a lot of organizations struggle with that.

393
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,840
So you think about that top line, you know, bringing

394
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,178
that shifting security left.

395
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,178
Well, that's something that we've really,

396
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,639
uh, brought into our organization. We

397
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,798
do security and resiliency. We've shifted as

398
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,779
far left as possible in the organization

399
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:10,139
and so that,

400
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,359
uh, we think about malware,

401
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,019
insider threat, DDoS, you know, we have our

402
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:16,879
DDoS, uh, prevention.

403
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:18,989
Um, so you know,

404
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,200
that's

405
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
really important to us. So again,

406
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:24,739
we have a lot of material that's out there that

407
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,779
explains how we've done these things, and if you

408
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,759
go and look at it,

409
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,139
uh, if you look at our security services, you'll see

410
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,219
how it explains our DDoS services, it explains

411
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,200
how we think about

412
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,798
culture of security, how we've pushed it left,

413
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:38,000
um, and then we think about software.

414
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:40,798
Of course you know when we design our software.

415
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,340
And we think about how we build our software,

416
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,918
we're thinking all the time about

417
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,460
uh not just the functionality that our customers ask

418
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,969
us for,

419
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,279
but we actually think

420
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,879
before we do anything, we have to make sure that we

421
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,678
have really thought about the kind of

422
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,359
threats and issues that might happen within our software.

423
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,418
The, the kind of uh

424
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,979
issues that you have with change, we're quite innovative in

425
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,918
how we do change, you know, we do

426
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,529
uh the rate of change in this organization. I

427
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,580
and when I tell customers how many changes we do, it's

428
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,719
quite frightening and I think they look at me and go white.

429
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,369
I think uh I don't think we could do that,

430
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:15,000
but we've worked to be better at change

431
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,038
and to deploy change of pace.

432
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,080
And uh you know,

433
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,779
I think uh Rob talked about traffic,

434
00:15:21,849 --> 00:15:23,940
but we look at traffic patterns and we design

435
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,119
our systems to handle surges in traffic,

436
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,739
uh to think about how we can manage any sort of additional

437
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:31,000
capacity. So all of those things are put into it and Rob's

438
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,558
gonna explain

439
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,379
later how some of that works.

440
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, so as we go through this, we'll pop back to this

441
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,298
slide and we'll cross out the risks as

442
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,678
we demonstrate how we've mitigated those. But

443
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,750
Steve, let's, uh,

444
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,158
let's talk about global infrastructure first. Yeah, I

445
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,590
think, I think a really important concept, and I, it's

446
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,418
interesting. I don't know if how many of you here have ever

447
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,320
been in a presentation from AWS

448
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,750
from uh maybe a

449
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,359
a solution architect or someone like that, and they've got

450
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,359
a, a little picture of data

451
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,200
centers

452
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,759
into a little region and they skip through it, off

453
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,538
they go through it.

454
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,149
And they get, and then suddenly you're into all the

455
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,849
fun stuff and services and what we do.

456
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:09,308
It's really interesting

457
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,928
when you sit down and you think, what is actually

458
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:12,729
in a region?

459
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,119
How do we build it?

460
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,739
And, and a lot of your uh colleagues

461
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:17,849
that may not be

462
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,450
as directly involved with AWS as you

463
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:21,840
maybe don't know.

464
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,330
You may know, that's great, and I hope you

465
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:24,869
do know.

466
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,330
Uh and if you don't, you'll find this really useful way of explaining

467
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,399
it to them. Um, but what we

468
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,690
kind of started with was,

469
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,038
what do people actually know when, when they

470
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,500
come to AWS and they want to use it. And remember

471
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,519
the kind of companies that we're dealing with are kind

472
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,840
of hybrid in nature.

473
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:40,820
They'll have SAS vendors, they'll have

474
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
some level of cloud exposure, and they'll have a lot

475
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,269
of legacy. So it's kind of a mix of things with the companies

476
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,000
that we're dealing with.

477
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,678
So what we kind of find was, no matter where you

478
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,529
went in the organization, right up to the,

479
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:52,869
the people that ran it, the board, the people that invested,

480
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,229
they all knew they had some data centers.

481
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,619
Because they paid for them,

482
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:58,840
right? And they generally knew where they were.

483
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,308
And they generally knew that er

484
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,090
they had one data center

485
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:05,430
that they ran workloads and then they had another data

486
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,489
center for backups.

487
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:09,068
This is kind of the model they had in their heads, and

488
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:11,549
some sort of synchronous or asynchronous replication

489
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,670
maybe. And so what we, uh,

490
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,789
and then they have a kind of standard kind of thinking that

491
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:18,118
there's maybe a database or an

492
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,309
application sitting in one of those data centers. So we sort of

493
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,380
started with this and said well what would it take to build a

494
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,380
region? So the first

495
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,578
thing we kind of thought was,

496
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,098
you might need some more stuff.

497
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,160
You might need a few more data centers.

498
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:33,068
And so Rob, Rob's very helpfully

499
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,199
here. Uh, drawing

500
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,199
these out for me, right?

501
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,750
So, uh, it's like magic, isn't it? And

502
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,509
they're even square, well, very good, right?

503
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,959
So we thought we need a lot more infrastructure if you're

504
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,098
actually gonna build a region.

505
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:47,009
So we kind of like, well what do you actually need?

506
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:48,509
So you know, we, you know,

507
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,390
uh, here we go.

508
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,989
This is one

509
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:55,588
set of maybe data centers,

510
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,890
and then we have another set over here in DC

511
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,088
2. And then because we like to be massively

512
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:00,650
redundant,

513
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:03,430
we have another one down here in DC 3.

514
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,969
Now for those that are guessing what these things could be,

515
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,818
uh we'd kind of call those availability

516
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:09,430
zones.

517
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,059
Um,

518
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:13,439
so that's the kind of logical access that you

519
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,479
have as a customer.

520
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,680
You have the,

521
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:18,239
you don't really get down to choose the data center.

522
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,400
Some of our, some of our availability zones have quite a few

523
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,199
data centers in them.

524
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,848
There's at least one data center.

525
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,098
OK, great. And then we'd like have to,

526
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,439
so we've only got one connection here that's not pretty,

527
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,699
not very useful.

528
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,420
So we'd love to we'd we'd build a lot of

529
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,000
interconnects between these availability zones.

530
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,209
OK.

531
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,259
And there would be high speed

532
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:41,818
interconnects

533
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,979
that would allow uh

534
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,719
synchronous replication between these availability

535
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:49,039
zones. And even within the data set, even

536
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,229
within the, where you've got more than one data center, we

537
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:53,318
would have tremendous amount of

538
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:55,979
uh interconnects between these data centers, effectively

539
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,039
there's a minimal transit time.

540
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,578
OK. So this is starting to shape up

541
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:03,088
a bit more like a, like a region.

542
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,269
And then we'd sort of think about power.

543
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,848
We like power. It's very useful.

544
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,729
Uh, so we'd have power, that's,

545
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,439
is that those ziggy zag things?

546
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,368
Power. Alright, OK.

547
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,029
So, and typically what we try and do is we try and draw

548
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,009
the power from

549
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,630
different grids if we can, or at least different distribution

550
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,828
points on the grid. Not everywhere has a separate

551
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,818
provider in the grid.

552
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,088
Different countries

553
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,930
uh tend to have

554
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:28,410
different approaches to this.

555
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,108
But where we can, we will try and draw those

556
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,150
power from diverse sources and even

557
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,348
within those data centers we'll have other ways

558
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,509
to power those data centers and those availability zones.

559
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:38,328
We'll have, you know,

560
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:40,989
uh, because we're managing the risk of

561
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:43,348
disruption, so we'll have, uh, generators and

562
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,828
oil tanks with gasoline in

563
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:48,269
them. Uh, you've seen that in Spain recently

564
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,269
where there was a, a country, Spain Spain and

565
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,729
Portugal, I don't know if you were, they had a

566
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,108
outage earlier in the year. It's very unfortunate that, you

567
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,269
know, with their new kind of approach to solar, the,

568
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,500
the grid became unstable.

569
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:00,309
And uh you know, because

570
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,088
we have these things we're able to run through it.

571
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:03,189
Uh

572
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,729
and we'll uh also, how far apart, yes,

573
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:06,529
good question.

574
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,088
We don't really think about distance.

575
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,449
We think about

576
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,989
what's the transit time, what's the return transit time?

577
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:15,729
And what we find is a good ready reckon

578
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:17,549
for this about 1 millisecond, I think, Rob.

579
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,489
Single digit milliseconds. Yes, yes.

580
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,380
Single digit milliseconds.

581
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,670
So that kind of leads you to, and

582
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,489
if people are kind of familiar with infrastructure,

583
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,029
that kind of still leaves you with our ability

584
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,328
to do synchronous replication between these

585
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,660
uh availability zones.

586
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,250
So if you go and look at uh

587
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,029
our literature, it'll talk about, you know, tens

588
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,848
of kilometers

589
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:40,108
kind of thing, depending on which country you're in.

590
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,469
And then that allows you some flexibility about where

591
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:43,969
you put things in terms of

592
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,309
uh managing the risks that we talked

593
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,088
about earlier about,

594
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:49,549
you know, environmental risks and managing

595
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,549
the floodplain risks or even seismic risks in

596
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:52,269
some places.

597
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,309
So if you go back there, you know,

598
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:56,150
our placement of the,

599
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,769
the data centers and availability zone

600
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:00,838
takes into account these things and tries

601
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,949
to minimize the impact of these things as much as possible.

602
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,969
They're not, it's not residual, you know, there's always

603
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,189
a residual risk, but it's, it's kind of gone.

604
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,180
OK, so that looks a bit

605
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,078
like a region,

606
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,259
if anyone's looked at this before, right?

607
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,779
And now we're gonna sort of talk about uh

608
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,400
using some of the AWS services like RDS

609
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,449
for example. Yeah, so what is

610
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,489
that application that was running in

611
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,489
the on-premise environment? What does that look like when it's

612
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:28,029
in AWS? Well,

613
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,368
I think it looks a bit like this, Rob. Tell

614
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:31,838
me if I'm wrong. I think we have,

615
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,549
we'll put a database into

616
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,140
ESE1,

617
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,680
to do, go onto the console, launch our launch

618
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,088
our database, our, our

619
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,269
relational database service allows us to do that.

620
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,729
And we'll probably replicate it over

621
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:45,309
to

622
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,250
uh ESE 2.

623
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,088
OK, and we'll have the app replicated

624
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:53,459
as well. The data's replicated so we'll have multiple

625
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:54,029
instances of the app.

626
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:56,529
And I think we'll try and have another instance of it

627
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:57,108
in

628
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:59,509
uh E3, might be a reed replica.

629
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,108
Um, so the data's there if we need it.

630
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:04,799
And that makes that application, if

631
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,338
we think back to the original

632
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,739
uh diagram that we looked at,

633
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:11,420
where we just had two data centers and a traditional model,

634
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,118
maybe some cluster set that's running across

635
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:15,900
from data center one to data center two,

636
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,400
we now have something that's a

637
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,509
lot more robust,

638
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,588
right, and it's taking care of other,

639
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,400
if we go back to those risks,

640
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,680
we can kind of knock off a few more, Rob, I think.

641
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,598
Yes, the thing to think about is how does this

642
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,049
resilience work now?

643
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,539
So if I put a uh if I put a load

644
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,910
balancer in the middle of this.

645
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,989
Steve, do you want to walk through, how does that work?

646
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:39,809
Well, you know, if I'm a customer and I'm a

647
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,920
client going to into want to access

648
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,088
that app, uh, instead of going

649
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,259
directly into, uh, the

650
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:47,009
initial app

651
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:49,328
on availability one, which you could do,

652
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:51,689
uh, if you use our, uh, load balancing

653
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,689
service, you'll go to that, that'll proxy

654
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,689
out the workload, and it might even be that

655
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:56,588
you go to

656
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,049
uh AZ, you know, you might go to all three AZs,

657
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:00,309
or you might go to just one of them.

658
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,009
Right, but the load balance will understand the availability

659
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,449
of the other parts of the application.

660
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,368
And in the case that

661
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,549
er for some reason

662
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:09,328
er the server crashed.

663
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:11,459
The data center went on fire,

664
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,299
the availability disappeared in a cloud of smoke,

665
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,160
availability zone disappeared in a cloud of smoke. You, your

666
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,209
customers should be able to recover into

667
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,779
SSE2 and SE 3.

668
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:22,269
There might be

669
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:25,049
some minor delays, there might be some minor

670
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,368
operational adjustments to do that, but effectively

671
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:28,828
it should be fairly seamless,

672
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,269
uh, and uh that,

673
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:32,838
I think that's how it would work, Rob. Yeah,

674
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:35,130
so that that way of deploying an

675
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,229
application with a copy in

676
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,779
one copy of the application in each availability

677
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,809
zone, which particularly if it's something mission

678
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,709
critical, that's what we'd advise you to do.

679
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,529
Out of the box, that's taken care of the

680
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,630
rest of these.

681
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,209
Uh, Physical risks that we've got on here, so if

682
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,769
a server crashes in one AZ,

683
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,709
you know, you can fail over to

684
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:53,670
another AZ,

685
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,828
uh, disk crashes,

686
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,729
uh, if there was a fire in one of the availability

687
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,890
zones data centers, then we're also taking

688
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,989
care of that, and cooling failure

689
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:04,289
and power failure as well.

690
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:06,989
Uh, you know, funny, I was, er, when I first started

691
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,029
in AWS,

692
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:10,108
er, having run a lot of stuff.

693
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,088
Uh, and I seen that one of our AZs had a fire,

694
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,900
one of our data centers had a fire at a at a mass panic.

695
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,358
I was like, oh my God, we've had a fire.

696
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,568
But the customers weren't bothered by it. They're insulated

697
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:22,769
from that. You know, we run our data centers very

698
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,078
hot, uh, and they're designed to do that.

699
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,390
So, um,

700
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,930
yes, but that they're starting to look at, that's quite an

701
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,989
interesting design there, Rob, in terms of resiliency.

702
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:33,568
So I wanna talk a little bit now about

703
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:35,568
the AWS services, because you remember we said

704
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:37,809
that AWS service design is also an

705
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,469
important part of the resilience story.

706
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,910
So everything that I've drawn here.

707
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,630
The thing that says app and RDS, so

708
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,459
app is running on the EC2 service,

709
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,229
so this is what we would call an EC2

710
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,439
instance. Elastic Compute

711
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,500
cloud instance.

712
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,559
But these are what we would call resources, these are the

713
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,559
deployed bits of a service that

714
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,098
you, the customer is looking after.

715
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,979
But it's a good question to ask, well, what is the service?

716
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,259
And really

717
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:06,059
what we're talking about is there's an EC2

718
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,318
API.

719
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,769
That you're calling and that's what's deploying

720
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,568
the the virtual machines and running them for you.

721
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:16,029
So there's another EC2 API

722
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:17,209
over here.

723
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,979
And another EC2 API over

724
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:22,618
here. So lo and behold, the EC2

725
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,400
service is itself

726
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,328
a multi AZ application.

727
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,299
So the services that you're building on are

728
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,500
relying on the same resilience

729
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,539
benefits of that multi AZ model.

730
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,209
So all the risks that we show

731
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,739
also apply, the mitigations also apply

732
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,000
to the AWS services.

733
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,469
Now, there's a very, very important

734
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,989
distinction here which comes back to the shared responsibility

735
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:47,229
model, because if you notice, this

736
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:48,289
EC2 service.

737
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:51,309
Steve here when he was building this application,

738
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:53,750
decided to put EC2 instances

739
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,279
in each availability zone.

740
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,989
Now if you wanted to, let's say you were running

741
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,108
some uh huge payment

742
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,150
processing system which is processing

743
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,229
credit card payments for a third of the United

744
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,328
States. You could put that

745
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,469
onto one

746
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,410
giant EC2 instance in one

747
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,410
AZ if you wanted to. That's, that's

748
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,410
down to you. We would absolutely say please don't

749
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,709
do that. You could do that.

750
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:17,449
Please don't doubt.

751
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:19,930
Uh, deploy it onto several 100

752
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,479
EC2 instances across multiple AZs,

753
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:25,348
but that is on your side of the shared responsibility

754
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:27,568
model. There are other kinds of services

755
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,430
though. Now, many of you may have seen.

756
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,269
In architecture diagrams,

757
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:35,328
usually in the corner of the diagram there'll be a

758
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,689
picture of a bucket

759
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:39,229
with the S3 service icon on there, and

760
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,229
that might make you think, hang on, what is that? Is that

761
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:42,348
a single point of failure?

762
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:43,959
What's it doing down there?

763
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,469
Is it, is it in those, is it there somewhere?

764
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,709
It's not uh outside of the region or

765
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,750
floating in space there, so the S3

766
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,789
service is also, let me choose a better

767
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:53,410
color for that.

768
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,828
Is also

769
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,549
implemented as APIs that you're calling.

770
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,400
When you're calling put and get, there's an S3

771
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,489
API here, here and down

772
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,959
here. So by

773
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:09,650
Amazing coincidence, it's

774
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,479
also a multi AZ application.

775
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,098
There's a difference here,

776
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,680
because this application is one that AWS

777
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,920
is managing on your behalf. You're not choosing,

778
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:19,029
well, unless you use

779
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,689
S31 zone, you're not choosing

780
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,729
the the availability zone where your

781
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,848
data is being stored. You just give S3 your

782
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:26,430
cat picture

783
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:29,009
and it breaks it up into lots and lots of little pieces and

784
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,150
then stores it very redundantly across

785
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,568
the region on your behalf.

786
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,759
So it's very important,

787
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:36,358
going back to your application,

788
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,868
that your engineers are aware of the kinds of

789
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,239
services that they're using.

790
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,789
Are they zonal services

791
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,039
like EC2

792
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,750
or are they regional services like S3,

793
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,779
because the resilience model changes

794
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,199
depending on how they're working with that.

795
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,959
So What we also

796
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,680
want to cover, so we've covered the global infrastructure,

797
00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:58,939
we've spoken about that.

798
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:00,539
And we've spoken about

799
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,160
um AWS service design,

800
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,439
how the service is designed and how they er

801
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,699
implement resilience.

802
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,059
We also spend some time talking about

803
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,170
AWS service operations.

804
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,880
So the teams, the single threaded teams

805
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,920
behind the services, how do they, how do

806
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,219
they work and how do they

807
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,299
include resilience in their processes.

808
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,390
This goes back to the risks that we talked about before.

809
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,890
Absolutely, so one of the key risks that we haven't

810
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,509
covered yet,

811
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,309
er, we haven't covered bugs and we haven't covered change

812
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,469
and deployment risk.

813
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,969
So let's go back to that.

814
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,368
So what I want to do is imagine that

815
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:39,348
there's a new AWS service team.

816
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,239
And they're building a new service, as let's run

817
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,358
through the kind of life cycle they run through and the

818
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:46,358
process they would go through to build and deploy

819
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,640
that service and get it out into production.

820
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:50,299
Now these teams

821
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,039
are run by single threaded teams

822
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,039
that we call two pizza teams. Many of you may

823
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,108
have heard that terminology, but this is not a kind of

824
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:59,239
sad and lonely UK one

825
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,279
person pizza. This is a massive, big and

826
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,279
friendly American pizza, so we're talking

827
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,279
about 12 to 14 people

828
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,318
here. Might be Americans here, we have to be careful what we

829
00:29:07,318 --> 00:29:08,729
say. They're lovely pizzas.

830
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,890
So, um,

831
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:13,568
these single threaded teams, they run

832
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,630
everything to do with that service. So they build

833
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,390
the software,

834
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,709
they deploy the software, they carry the

835
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,789
pages, so when something goes wrong they do the product

836
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,390
management of the software as well.

837
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:24,789
They are all encompassing, so a service

838
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:25,979
like S3

839
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,828
will be composed of hundreds of thousands

840
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:30,910
of different service teams, there will be all of those

841
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,229
teams, single thread running a component

842
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,250
of that service.

843
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,789
So with our new service being deployed,

844
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,920
it all starts with something called the

845
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,000
operational readiness Review.

846
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,539
So the operational readiness review

847
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,078
is a gate that

848
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,539
the team has to go through

849
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,160
where we would check a number of axioms.

850
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,858
So one of those axioms would be

851
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,578
ensure that you have enough capacity in your service

852
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,519
across all three availability zones so that

853
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,900
the service will carry on running unimpeded

854
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,199
if one availability zone is impaired.

855
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:04,719
So they need to have +50%

856
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,170
at least capacity in all three availability

857
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,358
zones to be able to do that.

858
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,219
There's a number of these axiom checks

859
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,699
in the operational readiness review and you'll see

860
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,029
er as I go through this,

861
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:17,920
how that builds up over time.

862
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,338
But this is a key part of how do we maintain

863
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:22,400
a high bar when new services come

864
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,759
online because we're making sure that everything in that

865
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,900
operational readiness review

866
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:28,318
is all the things that we've learned over the years and

867
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,509
how to make sure that service is built in the

868
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,549
right way. And

869
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,729
er nowadays this is something that we go

870
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:36,549
through every year, so it's an annual

871
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,088
recheck to make sure that we're still maintaining

872
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:39,910
that high bar.

873
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,799
But eventually the team will be ready

874
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
and they'll start building the software, so

875
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,959
a lot of requirements will go onto the backlog, the team

876
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,180
will be writing the code.

877
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,449
But eventually we have to get to the point of deploying

878
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,068
that software out now.

879
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:56,309
When we last published it, I think it was 2014,

880
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,759
we were making 50 million deployments

881
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,838
a year, and that's quite a long time ago now,

882
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
so you can only imagine how many changes

883
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,459
we're making,

884
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,160
uh, per second as we're

885
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,539
deploying this software out

886
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,779
into the field. So if you think about it,

887
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:12,479
38 Edibus regions

888
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,618
around the globe, 120 availability zones,

889
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,199
200+ services.

890
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,029
And making 50 million deployments a year

891
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:20,420
over 10 years ago,

892
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:22,549
how can we keep that safe,

893
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,049
as we're making all of that change and your own mission

894
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,029
critical applications are running on top of that.

895
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,680
So the way that we do that is we do it very carefully

896
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,959
and we use pipelines, we use automation

897
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,699
extensively in that process.

898
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,640
So it all starts with a pre-production

899
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,680
stage. Now that contains everything

900
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,920
that you might expect in a er

901
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,420
pre-production deployment of

902
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,380
code review with peers,

903
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,259
um,

904
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:49,118
performance testing, configuration

905
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:51,439
testing in lots of early stage environments,

906
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,809
environments which mirror the production environment and

907
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,380
all its dependencies as well.

908
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,430
But eventually,

909
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,890
once he got through those pre-production checks, and this is

910
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,949
all done automatically as well.

911
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:05,098
So another thing to bear in mind is these changes

912
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,160
that we're talking about, 50 million changes a year,

913
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:07,989
these are not

914
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
massive new feature changes, these are

915
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,380
typically very, very small changes, just a

916
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,420
few lines of code

917
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,858
where the developers made that small change, committed

918
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:16,598
it to Git,

919
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:18,680
and at that point, the automated

920
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,640
tools take care of everything from that point onwards.

921
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:26,108
So now we start the production deployment pipeline,

922
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,380
and it starts with a stage that we call one

923
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,890
box.

924
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,750
So it's very, very small change will be deployed

925
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,019
to typically 1 EC2

926
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,469
instance in one availability zone,

927
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,818
in one region around the world and then we

928
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,209
wait. We wait for a period

929
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,500
called the bake time,

930
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:45,029
and the reason we do that is we're trying to wait

931
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,709
for any

932
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,400
latent bugs or hidden bugs to

933
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,489
emerge during that period, so we'll, we'll be

934
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:52,719
testing it at that point. It'll be receiving

935
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,989
live customer traffic, this one instance.

936
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:57,969
If there's not enough customer traffic, we'll send it synthetic

937
00:32:57,969 --> 00:32:58,868
traffic as well.

938
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,098
If there's any problem detected,

939
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,509
so if any of the monitoring is off,

940
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,729
then that change will be rolled back.

941
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:09,430
We're very er careful to ensure rollback

942
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,549
safety, so the change will be rolled back automatically

943
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:13,750
by the tooling and it will be sent back to the developer.

944
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:15,078
But

945
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,660
assuming we get through that, uh, and it

946
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,259
passes,

947
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:20,699
then the change is rolled out to one

948
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,259
whole availability zone, so all the EC2

949
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,838
instances in one AZ for that service

950
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,140
will get this new copy of the software.

951
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,689
And then we wait again, we wait again for the

952
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:32,529
bake time

953
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,029
to check to see if anything shows up.

954
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:37,729
As a part of the deployment, what we usually

955
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:39,348
do is we ramp the traffic up,

956
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:42,098
starting at zero to this new deployment

957
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:44,529
to 50%, 100%, and then

958
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,250
on to 150%.

959
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,199
The reason we do that is to make sure

960
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,229
that the software itself has been built

961
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,459
so it can take

962
00:33:52,838 --> 00:33:54,838
one extra availability zone's worth of

963
00:33:54,838 --> 00:33:56,880
traffic when it gets deployed, so it always

964
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,269
goes up to 150%.

965
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,618
Assuming we go through that, then the

966
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:04,920
change will be, the small change will be deployed out

967
00:34:05,098 --> 00:34:06,459
to one whole region.

968
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:09,260
So one region somewhere in the world, all the EC2

969
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,500
instances in 3 availability zones

970
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,300
in that region.

971
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:15,530
And then we wait again for the baked time. There's

972
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,909
a lot of waiting involved here.

973
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,489
If any problem is detected, it'll

974
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,188
be rolled back.

975
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,208
But assuming it's fine, then the whole process starts

976
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,329
again, but usually we would double up at that point, so

977
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,628
we would go through one box in two regions.

978
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:32,019
And then one availability zone in two regions

979
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,429
and then doubling up again and eventually

980
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,090
that change will have made its way out

981
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,030
to all

982
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,429
38 regions around the world.

983
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,708
But if the, just imagine there's a problem.

984
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,010
We get to region 37 out of 38, this

985
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,500
change has been absolutely fine,

986
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,010
and some customer request comes in and it

987
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,010
exposes a bug and it's picked up by the

988
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,610
monitoring.

989
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,318
Purely automatically,

990
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:59,117
that change will be unpicked and rolled back

991
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:02,338
from all the EC2 instances in 37

992
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:04,338
regions, it will put back to the last known

993
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:05,117
good version,

994
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:07,728
and completely unpicked from

995
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,728
everywhere around the globe and then sent back to the

996
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,820
developer. And then the whole thing

997
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
has to start again. They have to go through, make

998
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,860
a change, go through the code review and start it

999
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,320
again. So you can see we're being

1000
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,699
extremely careful about this process because

1001
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,918
we know how important it is to get this right.

1002
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:27,679
My wallpapering, excellent.

1003
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,750
Um. So

1004
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:33,340
At that point, the change is now deployed

1005
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,918
out, and that's all been done by

1006
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,099
automated tooling.

1007
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,559
So at this point.

1008
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,389
We're now running in production and that same two

1009
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,539
pizza team are responsible for looking

1010
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:44,208
after that.

1011
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,648
Now there's a very useful reinforcing factor

1012
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:49,090
here in that if I've deployed a change.

1013
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,478
I made a change myself

1014
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,918
and I've deployed it and it's gone out to the field,

1015
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,059
and now I'm carrying the pager.

1016
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,898
Then if that goes wrong and I get paged

1017
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:01,139
at 4 a.m. on Sunday to say your

1018
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:02,010
change has gone wrong,

1019
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:04,418
that's a very useful reinforcing factor to make

1020
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:06,458
sure that I'm very careful in future about making

1021
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,159
that change.

1022
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:11,059
But now the changes aren't in production and we're monitoring

1023
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:13,219
it, and I'll come back to monitoring in a second, but

1024
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,260
we have a huge number of

1025
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,800
metrics. You can say that we're metrics obsessed.

1026
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,619
So if you look in some of our internal pages

1027
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,648
where we have the dashboard for S3,

1028
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,780
say, you will see pages

1029
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
and pages and pages of

1030
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,978
metrics covering every aspect of that

1031
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,599
service.

1032
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,639
Starting with some above the line metrics on

1033
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:35,079
uh service health, so telling us

1034
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,780
is this service healthy, is it all up and running

1035
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,639
as expected.

1036
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:41,300
And then lots of diagnostic metrics below

1037
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,179
that going down to the P99.9

1038
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:46,260
latency in the Sydney region for some

1039
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,458
small aspect of the service. I'll come back to why

1040
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,300
there's so many in a, in a minute.

1041
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,949
So those uh metrics have all

1042
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,978
got several alert thresholds on there.

1043
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,860
If those alert thresholds are crossed

1044
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:59,409
and the right conditions are met, then someone

1045
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,500
in the team is gonna get paged and then they have to go and

1046
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,478
address that issue.

1047
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,449
There's two more important aspects I wanted to cover

1048
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:07,309
here, so

1049
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,208
although we do try very hard

1050
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,329
to try and eliminate as many problems as possible

1051
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,269
and you've seen how careful we are,

1052
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,010
bugs will occur and sometimes they will get

1053
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,128
through this process.

1054
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:20,309
So

1055
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,228
When we have an incident,

1056
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:23,929
then we run through a

1057
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:26,378
process called correction of error. Now it'd be very

1058
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,489
unusual if any of you

1059
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,110
in the enterprises where you work, don't have

1060
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,228
a root cause analysis process, it's very

1061
00:37:32,228 --> 00:37:34,530
common, but we're very, very particular

1062
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,300
about the root cause analysis process which we run

1063
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,469
through called correction of error. Now this runs all the way

1064
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:41,469
through Amazon. If you go to the correction

1065
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,449
of error tool,

1066
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,269
you'll find that there's

1067
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,648
not only things to do with AWS but also

1068
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,030
roof blown off fulfillment center in Florida

1069
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,250
during a storm and.

1070
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:53,199
I put decaffeinated coffee into the caffeinated

1071
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,119
coffee pot, which is quite a serious incident,

1072
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,619
er, so everything like that has a

1073
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,239
correction of error inside Amazon.

1074
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,099
Now the reason we're very particular is there's a very

1075
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,199
set structure

1076
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,030
to this, so we ask very, very particular

1077
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,239
questions, so it starts with,

1078
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,898
How did you detect the problem?

1079
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,668
So was it detected by a customer?

1080
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,478
Now that's very rare nowadays, and

1081
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:18,869
if it was detected by a customer, then immediately

1082
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,208
the answer to that is, well we need some monitoring in

1083
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
place for that particular aspect that's just

1084
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:23,989
been shown up.

1085
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,679
So you can start to see more monitoring and alerting

1086
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,349
comes into play.

1087
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,599
But more typically it'll be one of our,

1088
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:33,409
one of our alerts picked it up and

1089
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,949
we found out in 30 minutes that something was going

1090
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:38,648
wrong. But then it asks, as a thought experiment,

1091
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,530
how could you cut that time

1092
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:42,309
to detect by half?

1093
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:45,128
And that probably means lowering an alert threshold

1094
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:45,688
or.

1095
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:48,668
Adding again some new monitoring lines, so you

1096
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:49,369
start to see

1097
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,849
how we get towards having

1098
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,168
so many metrics on those monitoring charts.

1099
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:55,688
And then we ask, well,

1100
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:57,530
how did you resolve

1101
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,159
the issue? What did you do, what kind of run book

1102
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,128
did you use to do it?

1103
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,539
And then also as a thought experiment,

1104
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:05,949
how could you reduce the blast radius

1105
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:07,728
of that problem by 50%, and that might mean

1106
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,070
reducing the number of customers impacted,

1107
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:12,269
reducing the time it took to

1108
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,628
recover from that, so.

1109
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,719
We'd then beer building actions

1110
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,179
out of the back of that correction of error process which would

1111
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:21,280
go on to the team's backlog for them

1112
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,789
to do.

1113
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,659
This process is tracked by our senior

1114
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,019
principal engineers, some of the most tenured engineers

1115
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:29,019
in AWS to make sure that these actions are

1116
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:29,800
followed up on.

1117
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,639
And the team then goes on to build it.

1118
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,489
But we also have a section where we want to get to the absolute

1119
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:37,679
root cause,

1120
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,590
and this section is called the five whys.

1121
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:43,199
If any of you have kids, if you've got a 4 year old

1122
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,418
and you'd be very familiar with them, just asking well

1123
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,019
why.

1124
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:48,539
So this process works to try and get to

1125
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:50,780
an absolute actionable root cause,

1126
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:51,840
so we might say,

1127
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,219
Why did the service fall over, because

1128
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,599
Rob ran a script with the wrong parameter. Well

1129
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,978
why did Rob run a script with the wrong parameter?

1130
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,958
Was it an issue where he hadn't gone through the

1131
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,300
training or well why wasn't it automated?

1132
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,030
Uh, so why was the wrong parameter accepted?

1133
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,119
Well, we, we had a backlog task to do that

1134
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:12,159
but we prioritized something else. So we'll just

1135
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,800
keep going, keep asking why

1136
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,800
until we get to some actionable, blame

1137
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,820
free. Actions off the back

1138
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,969
of that, so we don't think it's acceptable that

1139
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,050
the root cause of this problem was Rob. We

1140
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,179
want to get to something deeper that we can fix.

1141
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:27,820
Now,

1142
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,289
er, from time to time we will also run

1143
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,570
through correction of errors and

1144
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,090
look for any patterns

1145
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:36,728
within that. So we have a group called the deployment safety

1146
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,728
working group who will run through and look to see if there

1147
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,208
are any trends or patterns in there where we're encountering

1148
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,208
the same problem

1149
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,628
multiple times.

1150
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
And then what they will do is

1151
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,360
say, OK, well, what can we, what can we

1152
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,579
learn from that? And there's usually one of two things.

1153
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,659
So either

1154
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:54,349
Some new best practices,

1155
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,889
so this is how things feed into the axioms

1156
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,989
in the operational readiness reviews, so we've learned

1157
00:40:58,989 --> 00:40:59,909
something from that.

1158
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,478
Or

1159
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:02,918
there's gonna be

1160
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,340
some new automations in our

1161
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:05,898
pipelines,

1162
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,398
so they might add some stages to the pipeline.

1163
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:12,878
Uh, where we're going to build in some new automated

1164
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:14,949
checks to try and prevent that kind of thing in

1165
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:17,188
the future. Then

1166
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:18,728
the last part of this

1167
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,010
is a um

1168
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:23,489
what I would say is really the beating heart

1169
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,590
of AWS. This is the the

1170
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,688
machine that makes the whole thing go round

1171
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,148
and this is a call called the weekly

1172
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:31,489
optometrics call.

1173
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,829
Um

1174
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:35,438
So this is

1175
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,280
a

1176
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:39,619
critical inspection and

1177
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:41,159
learning and teaching event

1178
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:44,099
that happens every week inside AWS.

1179
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,119
So what we do is we get um

1180
00:41:46,418 --> 00:41:48,579
the leaders and the team from all

1181
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:50,929
200 service teams to join this call.

1182
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:53,458
The AWS senior technical leadership will join

1183
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,579
and run the call as well, those senior principal

1184
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,619
engineers, the most tenured engineers will

1185
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:58,280
be on there.

1186
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
And we run through a number of stages in there, and

1187
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,260
it starts with, starts with quick wins.

1188
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,139
So, uh, any quick wins from the

1189
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,489
previous week, so the reason we do that is, so

1190
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,898
let's say the S3 team have found some new technique

1191
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:13,340
to reclaim, uh,

1192
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,849
unused storage and they freed up, uh,

1193
00:42:15,938 --> 00:42:17,519
several petabytes of storage.

1194
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,260
So it's good that we kind

1195
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,340
of celebrate those wins, but also the

1196
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,500
other teams on the call will say, ah, I

1197
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,659
can use that and I'll put that into my service as well,

1198
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,820
so it's a great way of sharing that knowledge amongst

1199
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,360
the team.

1200
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,250
We run through

1201
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:33,969
any um

1202
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,708
very informative correction of errors

1203
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,929
from the previous week as well, so if there's been a

1204
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:41,289
er service incident, we'll run through that

1205
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,820
and those er tenured engineers

1206
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,829
will go through and say well what can we learn from

1207
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,989
that? What's the maximum amount of knowledge

1208
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:49,128
we can get from that.

1209
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:50,699
Those events

1210
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,519
And then we have a section called spin the wheel.

1211
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,050
Now when this was done face to face, there used to be a physical

1212
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,438
wheel that they would spin,

1213
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,679
and this wheel has the

1214
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,099
all 200 services written

1215
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:03,739
on there.

1216
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,239
If you spin the wheel, and we do it twice, and

1217
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,250
then we'll pick 2 service

1218
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,239
teams, if you're chosen,

1219
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:11,780
you have to step up to the mic and then you have to

1220
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,820
present your metrics from the

1221
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,599
previous week.

1222
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,938
Now. You'd be

1223
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,320
uh subjected to a forensic

1224
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,878
examination by the most senior

1225
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:23,780
engineers in AWS as to

1226
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:26,219
what happens with your metrics. So you can imagine

1227
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:28,659
that you're going through your pages of metrics.

1228
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,340
And let's say we're looking at the

1229
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,739
P99 latency in

1230
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,918
the Sydney region.

1231
00:43:36,418 --> 00:43:37,849
It went upside down cos it's Sydney,

1232
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,728
er, and so we have a graph.

1233
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,619
And let's say it looks a bit like this.

1234
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:46,438
Then they'll say, well, what is that spike?

1235
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,159
What does that mean? Have you investigated that?

1236
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,239
And this is where it becomes a teaching event as well, because

1237
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,309
they'll say things like, ah well we've seen a pattern

1238
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:55,300
like this when we were

1239
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,878
uh in the early days of Dynamo

1240
00:43:57,878 --> 00:43:59,918
DB and we learned these things. So

1241
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:02,050
maybe you wanna consider doing this in your service

1242
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,239
or checking this or introducing some new

1243
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,340
processes and practices.

1244
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,739
Um, or maybe they'll be looking at your alert

1245
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:09,599
thresholds.

1246
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,199
So a common one is,

1247
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:14,039
let's say you've got a service

1248
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,019
and.

1249
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:19,610
Let's get this big rid of this big bump.

1250
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:23,559
Let's say it looks like this, and then the alert threshold

1251
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:24,360
is up here.

1252
00:44:26,188 --> 00:44:27,728
So what's that telling you? Well,

1253
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,809
It's looking like the alert threshold is too high,

1254
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,360
so maybe you've just set that alert threshold at the

1255
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,369
wrong level because if there's a problem with that

1256
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,829
service, then it's not going to cross the threshold.

1257
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,648
It could be a couple of things, maybe you've just said it

1258
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:42,728
in the wrong way, you haven't been following our best practices,

1259
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:43,750
or it could be

1260
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,208
that in the previous week or earlier you've made

1261
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,369
some performance improvements. You've brought down

1262
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,449
whatever that thing is measuring, but you haven't

1263
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:51,909
yet changed the alert threshold.

1264
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:54,489
So they'll say, well, come on, you need to bring that down and make that a bit

1265
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:55,010
tighter.

1266
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:57,389
So it's this kind of learning which takes place.

1267
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,300
During that exercise,

1268
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:02,958
er, and it was a great way of allowing the

1269
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,159
junior teams to learn from those senior

1270
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:07,199
tenured engineers and

1271
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,360
build that learning into their operations. So

1272
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,320
there will be a number of actions which come out of this,

1273
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,750
so a lot of actions out of the ops metrics,

1274
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,300
actions out of the correction of error process,

1275
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,260
and those will go onto that team

1276
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:19,260
backlog.

1277
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,510
And then they'll build it into the service and that's

1278
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,329
how the cycle continues.

1279
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:27,728
Now also worth noting at this point that

1280
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:30,188
the things on that backlog, the features

1281
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,369
on that backlog

1282
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,030
are all put there, well about 80

1283
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,168
to 90% of it comes from you.

1284
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:38,869
So you might find that your uh account

1285
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,949
teams that are working with you might

1286
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:43,070
bring um some service teams

1287
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,648
to you to talk from time to time.

1288
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,050
The reason they're doing that is they're trying to

1289
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,250
find out what is it that you need, what changes

1290
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:49,840
that you need.

1291
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:51,949
So if you're able to harness that

1292
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,269
and work with those, then that's a great way

1293
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:57,250
to get the features that you need into AWS

1294
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,360
because that goes directly onto that backlog and

1295
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,369
then those features go into AWS

1296
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:02,429
and then get deployed.

1297
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,389
So What have we learned now? If

1298
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,079
we go back to our board of risks.

1299
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:10,619
So

1300
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:14,090
Now we, we can't, I wouldn't say that we

1301
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,179
just eliminate bugs completely, but we think we've

1302
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:18,260
got pretty good at eliminating bugs through all the

1303
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,199
pre-production checks and the way that we

1304
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:21,280
do things.

1305
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:24,780
And we've also covered change in deployment

1306
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,300
risks.

1307
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,849
I've got a little bit of time, so it might also

1308
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:33,000
cover. Surges in

1309
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,519
traffic.

1310
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,869
Now, to do with surges in traffic,

1311
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:39,489
let's imagine.

1312
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:42,949
Who? Let's

1313
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:45,369
imagine that you've opened a pizza

1314
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,418
restaurant. And this

1315
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:48,438
pizza restaurant

1316
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,918
has got a great feature that you can go to the restaurant

1317
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:53,260
and ask for a pizza and you get a pizza in

1318
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:53,820
one minute.

1319
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,590
So you've just launched this restaurant, it's doing OK,

1320
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,168
and then you find that Taylor Swift has tweeted

1321
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:01,429
about this restaurant

1322
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:04,188
and the news has gone out and suddenly there's a massive

1323
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,208
queue of people coming up to your

1324
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,250
restaurant. So there's a few interesting aspects about

1325
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,188
the way that this works, which means

1326
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,530
dealing with a surge in traffic like that can be quite

1327
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,099
tricky.

1328
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:14,610
So let's

1329
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:16,840
say this is the

1330
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:21,519
Number of customers

1331
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:25,478
coming in. And

1332
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:27,728
then Time

1333
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:29,110
to pizza.

1334
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,599
So right at the start,

1335
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:33,898
We're getting there, then.

1336
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:37,079
We're doing OK, time for pizza is pretty low,

1337
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:39,489
but what tends to happen is, this is gonna go up

1338
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,469
and up and up and up,

1339
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:43,590
and then any system, whether it's a pizza pizza

1340
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,829
restaurant or a,

1341
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,800
Digital service that you're running,

1342
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:49,559
after a while,

1343
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:50,760
things start to take

1344
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,519
too long, so in the pizza restaurant,

1345
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:56,139
the oven's gonna be full of pizza, there's gonna be mozzarella

1346
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,500
on the floor, the chef is having a, uh, having

1347
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,260
a bad day.

1348
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,958
In the digital service, the database is gonna be

1349
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:04,139
getting slower and slower, the disks are gonna

1350
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:06,340
be much more contention, the network's getting

1351
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,579
contention, eventually the service starts to slow,

1352
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,500
slow down.

1353
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,309
But there's 2

1354
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:14,309
important things to think about here. The first is your,

1355
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,199
your SLA with your customers. Remember you're getting a pizza

1356
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,409
in a minute, so there's some kind of SLA.

1357
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,458
Where at this point.

1358
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,570
They just start giving up.

1359
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,228
So you kind of breach the SLA and then the customer

1360
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:28,829
gives up.

1361
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:30,219
Now,

1362
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,898
interesting aspect here with digital services

1363
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,679
is, I mean this would be unusual in a pizza

1364
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,760
restaurant, but what happens is you put your request in

1365
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,438
for a pizza.

1366
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:41,938
And it's taken longer than

1367
00:48:42,228 --> 00:48:44,619
acceptable, maybe you've given up after 2 minutes.

1368
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:46,860
So that's what we call a timeout.

1369
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,139
So at that point you're gonna go away,

1370
00:48:49,438 --> 00:48:50,079
hungry,

1371
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:51,429
without your pizza.

1372
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:54,599
But the team is still making your pizza, it's

1373
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,769
still going into the oven, so there's no way for you to

1374
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,469
tell them, actually I don't want that anymore,

1375
00:48:59,128 --> 00:49:00,949
because the the system is busy.

1376
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:03,449
So that's kind of compounding the problem

1377
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,458
because you've gone and asked for a pizza and then it's still

1378
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,070
being made and now you've gone away again.

1379
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:09,559
That's a bit of a problem, but

1380
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,679
If you've dealt with digital services, you'll

1381
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:14,000
know what will happen at that point.

1382
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:16,329
What happens is you do a

1383
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,090
retry.

1384
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,280
So, rather than just going away and

1385
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,429
going to get McDonald's or something like that, you're gonna

1386
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,898
come back and put in another order for a pizza.

1387
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,309
So now as this traffic is going up, we're compounding

1388
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:28,889
the problem.

1389
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:30,728
Because we had our.

1390
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,708
Timeout value here,

1391
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:37,409
and we start retrying, so you're gonna ask for another pizza,

1392
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,610
so you've now got two pizza orders in there,

1393
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:41,878
so you can just see this gets worse and worse and

1394
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,010
worse, and you enter a stage which

1395
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,849
we call overload, you get into congestive

1396
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:47,510
collapse,

1397
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,829
where rather than,

1398
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:52,099
Getting a pizza every minute, it gets slower and slower and slower,

1399
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:54,648
and now we're not able to make any pizzas whatsoever.

1400
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:57,760
So this is the situation which we wanna try

1401
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,619
and avoid.

1402
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,360
Now, what we would say is

1403
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,360
before opening your pizza restaurant, you would

1404
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,699
want to do an awful lot of performance testing

1405
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:08,239
to make sure, to try and identify what is the

1406
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,320
maximum number of pizzas that we can make and what

1407
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,300
happens when

1408
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,898
Taylor Swift tweets

1409
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:14,199
and then we get a,

1410
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,599
a backlog of work which we just cannot cope

1411
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:17,458
with whatsoever.

1412
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:19,909
So

1413
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,369
how do we think about that? So what we could do is we could turn

1414
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:24,780
this around and do another graph

1415
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,719
now. Where

1416
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,389
Going to introduce a couple of terms, so

1417
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,320
Throughput

1418
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,958
Is the number of customers coming in and

1419
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,199
asking for a pizza,

1420
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,119
and goodput.

1421
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:43,469
Is the number of customers who actually walk away

1422
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:45,628
successfully with a pizza in a reasonable amount of

1423
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:48,208
time. Now we can

1424
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:50,329
draw the overload situation again in a

1425
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:52,628
new way by saying what happens here, so

1426
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,188
as we start off.

1427
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,708
Throughput is the same as goodput.

1428
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,570
Because

1429
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:02,458
we're not too busy at this point, people are getting their pizzas,

1430
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,179
it's fine,

1431
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,739
but as we enter that state of congestive

1432
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,789
collapse, this starts to tail off and we're

1433
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:08,728
plateauing here.

1434
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,228
Plateauing,

1435
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:14,148
er, and

1436
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,000
eventually we reach our overload condition

1437
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,429
where it just gets so busy we're no longer

1438
00:51:19,429 --> 00:51:21,889
able to make any pizzas and that's a bit of a disaster.

1439
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:24,250
What we wanna do

1440
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,610
is we would like to extend this

1441
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,909
a bit further.

1442
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:30,849
As much as possible.

1443
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,329
So what I'm going to talk about here is

1444
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,458
one technique that we use inside ADOS. This

1445
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,530
is not the only technique, it's a technique that

1446
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,510
you can use as well.

1447
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,168
There's articles on this in the Amazon

1448
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:43,458
builders' library that you can take away,

1449
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,039
and this technique is called load shedding.

1450
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:48,610
So a very, very simple idea. What we want to do

1451
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,800
is. In this period

1452
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,500
here, we were successfully

1453
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,938
serving customers and making pizzas.

1454
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,349
We want to protect that as much as possible.

1455
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,119
What we want to avoid is this dropping back to zero.

1456
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,280
The way we can do that is to say here.

1457
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:05,909
We're gonna start throwing work away,

1458
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:08,329
so we know the number of pizzas because we did

1459
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:10,648
our performance testing, we know the number of pizzas

1460
00:52:10,648 --> 00:52:11,269
that we can make.

1461
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,780
So beyond that point, we're just going to tell customers,

1462
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:16,599
no, sorry, we're full, go away.

1463
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:18,300
But we're gonna keep

1464
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:21,070
protect the fact that we can make some pizzas and the

1465
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,699
effect that this has is

1466
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,360
we can extend this line so we're still

1467
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:25,978
able to

1468
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:28,139
serve a fixed number of customers.

1469
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,760
And carry on and that buys us vital

1470
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,849
time, because what we can do now is we've got time,

1471
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:35,610
we know we're in an overload situation,

1472
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:38,128
we can bring on some more capacity, we can kind of wheel

1473
00:52:38,128 --> 00:52:39,409
in some more pizza ovens,

1474
00:52:39,728 --> 00:52:40,849
hire some chefs,

1475
00:52:41,168 --> 00:52:43,070
get some more mozzarella and tomato ordered,

1476
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,050
and we buy ourselves extra time. Now unfortunately,

1477
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,110
it's not a

1478
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:49,648
permanent solution, apart from the fact we're turning work

1479
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:50,188
away.

1480
00:52:50,728 --> 00:52:51,539
Eventually,

1481
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:53,949
when so much traffic arrives, the cost

1482
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:55,958
of shedding that load, the cost of

1483
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:58,329
telling people you've got to go away also overwhelms

1484
00:52:58,329 --> 00:52:59,030
the service.

1485
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,599
So what you'd usually find is at some

1486
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,099
point this is also gonna drop to zero.

1487
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,898
So it's not a permanent solution, but what this means is

1488
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,269
if you're in that situation of overload,

1489
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,679
you've now got a mechanism to protect yourself

1490
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:13,539
and buy valuable extra time

1491
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:15,059
to be able to recover from that.

1492
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,840
Now obviously the right answer here is that in

1493
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,938
advance you'd have tested to

1494
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:22,898
beyond the Taylor Swift tweeting point

1495
00:53:23,168 --> 00:53:25,239
and you'd be able to recover your pizza restaurant

1496
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,228
without doing this,

1497
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:28,599
but this is a vital technique to make

1498
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:30,760
sure that you're protecting the work that you're able

1499
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,039
to do. So

1500
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:35,780
We covered one more bonus

1501
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,309
risk.

1502
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,780
Let me talk about security risks a little bit. Yeah, go

1503
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,059
on. So, um.

1504
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,030
I learned something that was really good.

1505
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:47,438
Thank you, pizzas.

1506
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:49,809
Pizzas. I learned about, I didn't know you were a Taylor Swift

1507
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,469
fan. OK, so.

1508
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:53,458
We talked about

1509
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:55,090
Um,

1510
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,128
we talked about the deployment,

1511
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:59,059
the pipelines and how we deploy,

1512
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,679
how we can deploy at scale. We talked very carefully.

1513
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:03,750
But what if we don't want to do that?

1514
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:06,030
What if we wanna do something else and speed it up?

1515
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,000
Right, what if we've got a situation that we need to deal

1516
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
with? So I'm sure all of you

1517
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,079
had, uh, I guess a lot of you had fun

1518
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:13,918
for a log for Jay.

1519
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,340
Yeah. Yeah,

1520
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:17,539
exactly right.

1521
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,260
Uh, I've talked to a lot of my customers, you

1522
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,478
know, in this space,

1523
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,260
and I think what they really find quite interesting is,

1524
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:26,820
uh, how do you deal with that? How

1525
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,539
do you deal with,

1526
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,179
you know, situations like that. So actually what

1527
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:32,750
we can do is we can go back to those pipelines

1528
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,239
because they're well formed, well structured,

1529
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,329
and we have clear mechanisms to,

1530
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:39,739
uh, we use the word mechanisms in AWS, we

1531
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,849
don't use the word process, right? Uh,

1532
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,418
but we have clear approaches about how we're going to deploy

1533
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:46,648
safely. So in the case

1534
00:54:46,648 --> 00:54:47,269
where

1535
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,909
you need to respond to a situation

1536
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:51,050
fast,

1537
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:52,228
we can speed it up.

1538
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,199
OK, it's a balance.

1539
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:57,059
Right, you know, all the teams are on it.

1540
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,849
So, uh, in the case of there's a really good,

1541
00:54:59,918 --> 00:55:00,438
uh,

1542
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:02,860
there's a really good YouTube video where,

1543
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,418
uh, we go through this, um,

1544
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:07,559
but, and you can look it up, you'll see it.

1545
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:08,500
Um,

1546
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,179
but basically where customers have taken,

1547
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,458
you know, people that have,

1548
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,090
who are very careful in themselves but

1549
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,958
have all the sort of, because they haven't got the pipelines

1550
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:18,878
quite the way they want,

1551
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,550
it's taken them months to kind of remediate these sort of

1552
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,699
issues, so they're still at risk for quite a long period of time.

1553
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,829
We turned around in 48 hours,

1554
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,688
globally. Which is amazing,

1555
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,159
right, when you think about it.

1556
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,719
So when you're, when you're talking to,

1557
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,199
uh, when you're talking, if you think about

1558
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,478
why we came here today.

1559
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,800
What we wanted to do today is give you some insights

1560
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,039
into AWS

1561
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,119
about how we build things, why we build

1562
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,159
them the way we do,

1563
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,360
how we do deployment,

1564
00:55:47,918 --> 00:55:49,739
the, the care we take to think about

1565
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,079
uh the various risks that we're under,

1566
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:54,438
you know, whether it's the API calls, whether it's the pizza.

1567
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:57,510
I don't know which pizza shop this is, but the

1568
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,579
pizza shop that you're talking about, he likes pizza,

1569
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:00,449
who knew, right?

1570
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:02,929
Um, we wanted to understand

1571
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,360
how to think about this,

1572
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,530
you know, so that you can explain it to people.

1573
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,389
That's really important to us and

1574
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:10,869
we're actually spending a lot of time in, uh,

1575
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:12,168
in our own industry,

1576
00:56:12,628 --> 00:56:14,769
uh, with, uh, financial services, which is a highly

1577
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:15,769
regulated industry.

1578
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:17,809
And has to think about all these things

1579
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,059
and we're spending a lot of time

1580
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:21,469
helping everybody to kind of kind of come up with a common

1581
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:23,550
model in their thinking, so you know

1582
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,860
we're trying to evangelize this sort of thoughts. It it

1583
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,648
seems pretty simple,

1584
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,239
but it's a good framing for a lot of these things.

1585
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,929
And you and the other thing is

1586
00:56:31,228 --> 00:56:33,429
there are always gonna be risks that we haven't even

1587
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:34,010
thought about.

1588
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:37,070
So the fact that we've thought about a lot of risks and we've kind of

1589
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,378
built these capa capabilities,

1590
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,159
you've got that two pizza team working

1591
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:42,719
together

1592
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:45,280
in the way that we discussed, and then you've got the the

1593
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,260
bigger sort of uh

1594
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,639
uh coming together in our

1595
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,148
operational weekly meetings, right,

1596
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:53,780
which really is a spin the wheel exercise.

1597
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:54,760
It, it's,

1598
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,239
I was quite shocked when I first saw it, but it's very

1599
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:58,938
much no blame culture,

1600
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,918
get to the bottom of things as Rob said.

1601
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:02,489
This, this is why

1602
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,789
uh when we get into this and we explain to

1603
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,789
everybody why we think

1604
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:08,869
about things in a risk framework and how we tick

1605
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:09,409
them all off,

1606
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:11,889
uh, then when it gets into kind of these

1607
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:14,389
uh issues when we have

1608
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,469
uh security issues, we're able to go and rectify

1609
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,789
those very, very quickly.

1610
00:57:21,478 --> 00:57:22,628
Excellent. So,

1611
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:26,969
Thank you very much for your time today.

1612
00:57:27,168 --> 00:57:29,409
Please, uh, make sure you fill out the session survey

1613
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:30,449
