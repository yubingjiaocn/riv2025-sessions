1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,750
- I'm Jovana, Senior Technical
Evangelist at Atlassian.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,580
I specialize in platform engineering

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,990
and cloud infrastructure

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,460
and also in Rovo Dev

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,293
and everything to do

6
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:11,820
with improving software
development lifecycle.

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,410
Let's get into it.

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,210
Now, before we do dive in,

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,070
let's quickly set the stage.

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,070
So, why are developer productivity
and quality so critical?

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,000
My favorite explanation to that

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,510
is that if you invest in your developers,

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,040
they will have better support,

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,050
creating better product.

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,240
If you have a better product,

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,430
your company brings revenue.

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,560
It's as simple as that.

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,780
And at Atlassian,

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,720
we now run Developer Experience report,

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,020
and each year we learn something new.

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,360
From our 2025 DevEx report,

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,060
we've learned that 99%,

23
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,400
so almost every developer,

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,150
has reported time savings using AI,

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,843
but still is losing time across
auto development lifecycle.

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,540
They're only spending
16% of their time coding,

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
which we all know that's not
the friction for developers.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,910
The other 84% is where
AI tools and assistants

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,610
have the real market opportunity

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,220
to change that and improve it

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,790
because really, developers
are losing valuable time

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,470
on non-coding tasks,

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,593
and that's exactly what I
wanna talk to you about today.

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,570
Software development is
at its core a team effort,

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,370
and our vision at Atlassian

36
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,040
is for every software development team

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,710
to have a teammate that deeply understands

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,760
their organizational context

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,500
as it's captured in the
Atlassian Ecosystem,

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,140
from Jira issues through Confluence pages,

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,090
all the way through the codebases,

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,050
wherever those codebases live.

43
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,010
That teammate should be aware
of your engineering history,

44
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,520
including past incidents
and their resolutions.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,440
Now, that intelligent teammate

46
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,770
can put all that
knowledge to work for you,

47
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,140
assisting you wherever you are working,

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,480
whether that's a terminal, the ID,

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,363
the CI/CD pipelines, or maybe even Jira.

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,840
And that teammate can be Rovo Dev,

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,690
and I would like to introduce you to it.

52
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,690
Rovo Dev is Atlassian's
AI-powered agent for developers.

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,390
It is designed to accelerate
software development lifecycle

54
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,940
all the way through code planning,

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,580
code generation, code reviews,

56
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,490
and automation of repetitive tasks

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,740
and all that at scale.

58
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,550
It understands both natural
language but also code,

59
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,070
which means you can interact with it

60
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,690
wherever you're working.

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,880
It is powered by
Atlassian's Teamwork Graph,

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,440
which means it's got context

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,833
of all of your data within
the Atlassian Ecosystem.

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,660
Now, of all the places that
you can interact with Rovo Dev,

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,060
my favorite one is the CLI

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,390
because it's meeting me
where I like to work.

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,710
It leverages Teamwork Graph,

68
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,090
so I can ensure

69
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,210
that it has all the
right suggestions for me,

70
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,190
it's got all my real context,

71
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,410
and it knows my business.

72
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,313
But let's take a look at it in action.

73
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,010
Now, here is a website

74
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,870
that I created one time,

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,650
and we have these speakers
that are all wrong.

76
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,360
Yep, that is me,

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,800
Jovana, Senior Technical Evangelist,

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,660
but that was not my face.

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,220
What I can do is I'm gonna ask
Rovo Dev to fix this for me.

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,490
Right now, I've just
authenticated Rovo Dev,

81
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,800
I've gone to my Jira issue

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,490
and I've literally just
copied that issue link

83
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,803
and pasted it into Rovo Dev.

84
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,593
Rovo Dev is pulling all that information,

85
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,680
the description,

86
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
any other links that I might
have added to this issue

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,270
just so it can give me
the best response it can.

88
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,000
Now, it might be leveraging
memory file as well,

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
depending on what I had added

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,260
in that description of the ticket.

91
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,080
If I go back and refresh, it's updated,

92
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,640
and now all of us kind of look

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,990
the way we should be looking like.

94
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,520
That is Shane, that is Willer,

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,870
and that was me.

96
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,370
Now, one of the cool things
is I can just copy an image,

97
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,970
paste it into Rovo Dev

98
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,063
and let Rovo Dev read the image as is,

99
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,950
detecting what is it that was on the image

100
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,840
so that it can make those changes.

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,780
It is that intelligent
that it will recognize

102
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,520
that there are certain
things on that image

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,560
that are not supposed to be there,

104
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,630
and it goes on and fixes it.

105
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,610
I'm quickly swapping between the two

106
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,740
just so you see that it's actually updated

107
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,593
exactly what I highlighted
that I need changing on.

108
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,570
Next, we've introduced
an AI-based code reviewer

109
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,240
that is also part of Rovo Dev.

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,090
On repositories where Rovo Dev is enabled,

111
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,790
Code Reviewer will automatically run

112
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,640
after your pull request is created.

113
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,500
Code Reviewer spends a few minutes

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,150
analyzing the code changes

115
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,660
and then it comments directly
onto your pull request

116
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,730
with all the possible recommendations,

117
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,930
fixes and improvements
that should be made.

118
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,300
It makes comments, including feedback

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,850
and things like bugs and maintainability,

120
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,003
readability, security,
and so on and so forth.

121
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,600
And there are ways to
improve your code reviewer

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,470
and tailor it to your
specific organizational needs.

123
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,960
Firstly, acceptance criteria.

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,520
It is designed to bridge the gap

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,970
between your requirements and your code.

126
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,650
Acceptance criteria checks automatically

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,420
and compares the code in your pull request

128
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,780
to the requirements you
had in your Jira issue.

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,203
It's checking if you built
exactly what you said you would.

130
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,730
Now, you can catch mistakes
early with this feature,

131
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,950
and we've actually been
told by software teams

132
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,250
that it has actually
saved them a lot of time.

133
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,700
Secondly, we have custom instructions

134
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,310
that you can set up for your repos.

135
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,740
Now, you can teach Code Reviewer

136
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,520
exactly what matters to your organization,

137
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,190
to your team, to your codebase.

138
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,100
Now, every team has unique ways of working

139
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,500
and different standards
that they want to enforce,

140
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,380
and sometimes generic
code just doesn't cut it.

141
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,280
So, if you teach Code
Reviewer certain standards,

142
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,900
design principles,

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,090
and you feed that to Rovo Dev,

144
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,510
every time your pull request is created,

145
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,880
what will happen is Rovo Dev will detect

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,290
based on these standards

147
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,263
that you are violating those principles.

148
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,840
It is described in your
standard natural language,

149
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,450
so just write in English, plain English.

150
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,300
And as long as you commit
that into your repo,

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,550
you should be good to go.

152
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,760
Now, we've also launched Rovo Dev in Jira.

153
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,340
It is very soon coming to open beta.

154
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,910
Temporarily it's in beta, closed beta,

155
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,480
but it is a self-contained
AI-driven workflow

156
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,170
that helps you tackle work
items with efficiency.

157
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,793
And let's have a look at a demo.

158
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,980
Let's have a look at Rovo Dev in Jira.

159
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,560
What this means is you'll
be able to trigger Rovo Dev

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,660
directly from your Jira issue,

161
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,240
and even do that at once

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,110
for number of your Jira
tickets from the backlog.

163
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,770
What it does, it opens
up an interactive sandbox

164
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,290
that looks and feels like VS Code

165
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,840
directly within your Jira issue.

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,120
Now, everything happens autonomously,

167
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,220
which means Rovo Dev
will work on your issue,

168
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,900
it will create a pull request,

169
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,460
and it will let you know

170
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,770
when there is something for you to review.

171
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,740
It will also update the
status of that Jira ticket

172
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,020
if obviously you're the owner.

173
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,440
Now, the benefits of this
is at any point in time,

174
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
you can also go back

175
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,000
and look at all the sessions
that you've triggered

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,310
with Rovo Dev within Jira.

177
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,400
Only you have access to this sandbox

178
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,530
because it feeds off of your credentials,

179
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,690
so security is in place.

180
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,520
Now, what actually happens,

181
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,980
this opens up a chat with Rovo Dev.

182
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,230
If you're not happy with what you see,

183
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,700
the changes that it made,

184
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,950
you can go back and give it some feedback.

185
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,590
And I do encourage you to
give it back some feedback

186
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,780
if you're not happy with what it's done.

187
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,430
Ask it to make more changes.

188
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,660
Why not?

189
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,440
Once you are ready with
everything that it's produced,

190
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,720
you can go and create a pull request,

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
and this is the stuff
that I told you about,

192
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,513
having access to all of
your sessions at all times.

193
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,970
We've also brought Rovo
Dev extension into VS Code.

194
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,710
So, it's...

195
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,570
Actually, let's get to
the video immediately

196
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,273
and then I can walk you
through what it actually does.

197
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,630
Internet is better this time, let's go.

198
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,960
So connecting your Atlassian cloud side

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,170
will instantly pull all your Jira tickets

200
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,730
that you are assigned to,

201
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,780
whether it's in to-do,
progress or in review.

202
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,893
Now, you can start
working on a Jira issue.

203
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,303
Ah, internet is not on my side today.

204
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,120
So you can start working
on your Jira issue

205
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
directly from the VS Code.

206
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,290
What it does is it will open up

207
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,123
Rovo Chat

208
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,170
and you can just tell it

209
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,210
what kind of stuff you want it to do,

210
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,283
attaching the Jira issue to it.

211
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,300
It will also send you notifications

212
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,360
if anyone has made changes
to the Jira tickets

213
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,870
that you are following or working on.

214
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,460
So, if you are working from
the VS Code with Rovo Dev,

215
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,930
you will be getting
notifications at all times.

216
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,030
So very similar to Rovo Dev in Jira,

217
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,550
very similar to Rovo Dev in CLI,

218
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,820
you can talk to Rovo Dev from VS Code.

219
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,063
We are working on adding that
to JetBrains, stay tuned.

220
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,750
Now, productivity for software teams

221
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,890
is increased through automation
in Rovo Dev's Code Reviewer.

222
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,568
Automation rules may be created

223
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:52,173
to review pull requests or generate code.

224
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,823
Is anyone else experiencing
poor internet today?

225
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,493
A lot of us are.

226
00:10:58,493 --> 00:10:59,326
Okay, great.

227
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm not alone, I'm not...

228
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,880
Okay, I'm not alone in
everyone experiencing.

229
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,550
Okay, we're just gonna
have to roll with it, guys.

230
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,920
So, with Rovo Dev in automations,

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
you can enforce organizational
code quality standards

232
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,110
across teams and repos.

233
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,800
So imagine all those code
standards that you wanna enforce,

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,830
now you can apply to more
than just one codebase,

235
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,920
you can apply to all of your workspaces.

236
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,760
You can also delegate
repetitive tasks at scale,

237
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,090
letting your team focus on important work.

238
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,100
Now, once you set up your coding,

239
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,550
security, privacy, or design standards,

240
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,880
you can use Rovo Dev
to automatically review

241
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,120
every pull request
against those standards.

242
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,420
You can also enter custom instructions

243
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,200
for Rovo Dev to use when
reviewing your pull request,

244
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,673
like I've done just here.

245
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,650
And similarly, you can
define common coding patterns

246
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,310
and use Rovo Dev to
automatically generate code

247
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,650
for repetitive tasks.

248
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,040
So, it lives in Jira in multiple ways.

249
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,350
You can automate pretty much anything.

250
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,290
Now, I'm literally demoing

251
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,000
the stuff that I've asked it to do

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,090
and identify all the sort of logging

253
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,270
non-compliance standards
that we don't allow,

254
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,353
and it's actually done and
told me about the violation.

255
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,000
We've also launched the
Rovo Dev in pipelines

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,513
in Bitbucket Cloud as part of Rovo Dev.

257
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,340
It diagnoses and resolves CI/CD pipelines,

258
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,720
all the failures

259
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,680
and analyzes those failed
builds through steps

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,330
and provides root causes,

261
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,060
suggesting actionable fixes.

262
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,990
Actually, the more you
use Rovo Dev in pipelines,

263
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,980
the better it gets

264
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,000
because it will learn about
your failed builds each time.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,180
So instead of manually
digging through your logs,

266
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,270
the troubleshooter surfaces
that context for you

267
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,073
directly in Bitbucket Cloud.

268
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,980
Now, how does Rovo Dev

269
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,180
actually stand out from all
the other AI coding assistants?

270
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,420
Apart from not only being
an AI coding assistant,

271
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,390
but it does help with all the other 84%

272
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,640
of software development lifecycle tasks

273
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,800
that I know no one really wants to do.

274
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,610
Well, Rovo Dev uniquely connects to Jira,

275
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,330
Confluence, Bitbucket, but also GitHub,

276
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,460
providing context aware insights

277
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,860
across your entire tool chain,

278
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,660
leveraging the Teamwork Graph

279
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,050
that connects your
Atlassian Ecosystem data.

280
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,870
Secondly, it is an AI-powered automation

281
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,450
across the software development lifecycle.

282
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,750
So, unlike tools that focus on only code,

283
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,120
Rovo Dev does a lot more.

284
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,290
Secondly, it is a terminal-first
context-rich experience,

285
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,940
which means it is designed

286
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,070
to meet you wherever you are working,

287
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,830
in the IDE, in the CLI,

288
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,493
in Jira, and in the CI/CD pipelines.

289
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,940
And it is enterprise grade
security and customization.

290
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,790
It lets teams customize workflows,

291
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,260
set review standards,

292
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,233
but also tailor AI behavior.

293
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,980
Thank you so much for listening.

294
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,270
If you do have any questions,

295
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,710
I will be right behind.

296
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,630
Also, I'm at the Atlassian booth,

297
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,600
and there's a lot more demos
I can do than just this one.

298
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,650
Thank you all for coming,

299
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,323
and thank you all for being patient.
