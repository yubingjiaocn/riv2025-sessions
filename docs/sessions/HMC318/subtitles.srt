1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,493
- Very good.

2
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:05,820
Well, welcome to "Multicloud
security best practices."

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,433
I think we're best friends now.

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,390
- I think we just became best friends.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,150
- This is Luis. I'm Geoff Sweet.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,230
I'm a security specialist here at AWS.

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,300
I've been here about six years,

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,160
a little over six years,

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,530
and I have many loves in life,

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,943
but one of my very biggest loves is tacos.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,210
- My name is Luis Pastor.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm in Geoff's team, as you can see.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,470
I've been here for three and a half years.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,290
And love is never a competition,

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,790
but if it was,

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,350
I love tacos more than Geoff.

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,210
And we're taking recommendations,

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,560
so at the end of this talk,

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,600
if you have a good recommendation
for a taco in town,

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,433
let us know.

21
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,198
We'll be over there.

22
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:49,470
- (chuckles) Yeah.

23
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,440
And because this is a silent session,

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
we won't get the chance to
do active question and answer

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,273
during the talk.

26
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:59,160
But, Luis and I will be
out back here afterwards.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,800
So if something comes
up you want to ask us,

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,700
please come back.

29
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,960
We'd love to chat with you.

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
So our session today,

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
we're gonna talk about
some of the challenges

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,433
that goes on with multicloud,

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,290
security strategies specifically.

34
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,120
We're gonna talk about
some common challenges

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,193
like how and where to federate,

36
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,890
how to manage your data
protection and privacy,

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,170
how to gain some visibility

38
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,060
around what's going on in
your multicloud architecture,

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,160
what does it mean to scale your teams

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,190
or tools to help you in that endeavor,

41
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,140
and what are some next steps

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,423
and some resources that
are available to you.

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm happy to tell you that none of us,

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,360
Luis and I are not here to
talk you out of multicloud,

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,283
but we're definitely here to help.

46
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:57,660
So, multicloud security strategy.

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,550
- So we love definitions.

48
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,860
So let's start with the definition.

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,610
So at AWS, we are defining
multicloud as an organization

50
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,560
that operates in two or more
cloud service providers, right?

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,470
That means you have IT
solutions or workloads

52
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,080
in two or more cloud service providers.

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,710
Is there anybody here that's
already operating in this way?

54
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,543
Yeah.

55
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,920
A lot of us already are there.

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,310
So we really wanna make sure
that you have the freedom

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,980
to operate wherever you can
do that more efficiently.

58
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,440
And like Geoff said, we're here to help.

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,700
If you're interested on
security, we have this talk.

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,020
There's other conversations

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,740
in the session going around
FinOps, observability,

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,510
developer experience,

63
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,150
and that we are going to
be the multicloud booth.

64
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,203
So come and say hi.

65
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:48,510
We'll also show you

66
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,090
how we created the picture in
the beginning, if you want.

67
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,923
No AI,

68
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,510
only Photoshop.

69
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,343
So,

70
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,277
many of you already multicloud,

71
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,850
so you already know.

72
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,067
Most organizations don't just
wake up one day and decide,

73
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,450
"I'm going to deploy in a
different cloud," right?

74
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,090
A lot of us have
different business drivers

75
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,433
that are gonna push us to go that way.

76
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,160
We have some examples here.

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,780
They're not all of the different
drivers that may push you,

78
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,630
but these are some of the
ones we see constantly

79
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,540
through our conversation
with our customers.

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,420
The first one is gonna be
mergers and acquisitions.

81
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,440
This is where your organization
acquires another one,

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,450
and then maybe you
operating in another cloud,

83
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,580
so now you're a multicloud organization.

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,610
Like if you operate a taco place

85
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,990
and you buy a quesadilla place,

86
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,390
now you're operating both, right?

87
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,020
So you have to understand
both considerations.

88
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,240
Differentiated capabilities.

89
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,890
Maybe you have a workload

90
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,510
that has specific business requirements

91
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,180
and then you are going
to deploy that workload

92
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,200
in another cloud that
better fit your needs.

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,213
So you're gonna become multicloud.

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,790
Regulatory requirements, right?

95
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,850
This is more to do with
security and compliance.

96
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,490
Think about things like data sovereignty.

97
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,080
Maybe you have to deploy in
one place that's a geo location

98
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,810
and that drives your
decision to go with one cloud

99
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,830
on another one.

100
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,590
And then, of course,
independent software vendors.

101
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,750
Maybe you start working with an ISV

102
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,390
and that ISV is operating another cloud.

103
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,630
Maybe your share of their
responsibility model,

104
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,510
your controls that you're
responsible for are lower

105
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,010
on that use case,

106
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,480
but you still have to understand

107
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,240
how they're addressing
your security concerns.

108
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,670
So I think the takeaway from this slide is

109
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,280
that it doesn't matter what the driver is,

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,460
the concern here is going
to be governed security

111
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,140
and compliance, right?

112
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,760
That's going to have to be extended

113
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,040
throughout your multicloud estate

114
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,770
so that you have the mechanisms in place

115
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,600
to protect the data that you're using,

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,670
the systems that you're using.

117
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,920
So we'll go through that journey now.

118
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,080
Let's talk about some of the questions

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,820
that you may want to ask yourself.

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,810
You may already be there,

121
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,070
but it's maybe a good thing

122
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,280
to start thinking through
some of these considerations

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,530
to understand the challenges
that you went through

124
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,033
and maybe come up.

125
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,280
And we have more than this,

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,550
so please talk to us after this talk.

127
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,220
We can have longer conversations.

128
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,320
But one of them is going to be,

129
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,410
how do your security operations
look like now, right?

130
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,350
Do you have a good understanding
of your current state?

131
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,210
Do you understand where your controls are

132
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,300
and how they are protecting
your data, your systems?

133
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,770
Do you have the capability to
extend those security controls

134
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,110
to a multicloud environment?

135
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,900
Here, we're talking more
about people and process.

136
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,210
So do you have the mechanisms in place

137
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,910
to extend those processes
to a multicloud environment?

138
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,187
Are you ready to move to another CSP

139
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,023
and expand your estate to a multicloud?

140
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,720
Another one is going to be,

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,490
who will own your security response

142
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,710
and monitoring capabilities, right?

143
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,680
A lot of organizations
have that distributed.

144
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
A lot of organizations
centralize those capabilities.

145
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,820
So what are you gonna do?

146
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,440
What's your decision gonna be

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,783
and what considerations are
gonna drive that decision?

148
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:19,170
This is true for other
security capabilities,

149
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,730
but in our opinion,

150
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,380
most important for security response,

151
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,210
because timing is gonna be of the essence

152
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,220
when you're responding to an event.

153
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,390
And then monitoring,

154
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,940
because visibility is going
to be so much more important

155
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,040
in a multicloud environment, right?

156
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,473
It's already important
when you have one cloud,

157
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:37,740
it's gonna be more important
when you have different clouds,

158
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,510
when you talk about two or three,

159
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,863
even more important, right?

160
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,640
Another question you may ask yourself is,

161
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,810
what tools do you already
have that are multicloud?

162
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:51,150
A lot of our customers focus on tooling,

163
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,760
and this is an important consideration,

164
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,310
but the good news here is
that a lot of the tools

165
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,140
that you may already be using,

166
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,850
they're already multicloud.

167
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,860
So you can start extending those.

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,660
And if you have expertise,

169
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,520
if your teams already
know how to use them,

170
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,810
how to deploy them,

171
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,433
it's a lot easier to deploy them

172
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,230
to a multicloud environment.

173
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,943
You get those benefits right away.

174
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,480
Another one of the
questions is going to be,

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,860
what are the divisions for?

176
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Things like SecOp, AppSec,
governance, auditing, security.

177
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,350
So all those teams are going
to have to communicate,

178
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,460
coordinate,

179
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,713
and if they're doing it in one cloud,

180
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:32,550
it's gonna add a lot of complexity
to do it in two or three.

181
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,170
So how do you think through,

182
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,150
how do you best manage your teams

183
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,690
and the tools they need

184
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,990
to drive those security requirements

185
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,870
throughout the multicloud state?

186
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,800
And finally, but even
maybe most important,

187
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,080
how do you enforce data governance?

188
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,090
Do you know where your data lives now?

189
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,310
You have good data flows,

190
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,760
you have good diagramming that
tells you where your data is,

191
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
how it's being processed,

192
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,180
how it's being transmitted,
where is it stored.

193
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,160
Because it's going to get more complex

194
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,327
in a multicloud environment.

195
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,390
And you really want to
understand where your data lives

196
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,510
so that you can apply
those security mechanisms

197
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,490
where that sensitive data is,

198
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,203
so you can protect it, right?

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,860
So these are some of the
considerations and challenges.

200
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,800
Let's start addressing some of those.

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,530
And one of the things we recommend here is

202
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,250
start by using a multicloud
security framework, right?

203
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,380
Here, we have NIST CSF.

204
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,860
So a NIST cybersecurity
framework as an example.

205
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,600
It doesn't have to be this one.

206
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,060
Pick whatever fits your needs, right?

207
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,600
Whatever you may already be
using or even an integrated.

208
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,530
But what the point we're
driving here is going to be,

209
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,530
pick a high-level cloud-agnostic,

210
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,910
cloud-neutral framework

211
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,370
that can drive your
posture forward, right?

212
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,340
So focus on those outcomes,
not recommendation.

213
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,400
We'll talk more about what
that means in a little bit.

214
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,960
But the multicloud
security framework is going

215
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,460
to help you in a couple different ways.

216
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,923
So we talked about measurability, right?

217
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,560
It's gonna help you
understand where you're at,

218
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,100
and it's gonna use that
cloud neutral language

219
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,240
to evaluate your entire
estate across the clouds

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
to understand where you're going.

221
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,310
So when you have a good security baseline

222
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,120
that is comprised of those
cloud-agnostic controls,

223
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,940
it gives you something
you can plan for, budget,

224
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,233
and measure against.

225
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,130
The second thing it's gonna
provide you is the ability

226
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,070
to communicate more effectively
within the teams, right?

227
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,020
You have that cloud-agnostic framework

228
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,030
that you can use to communicate.

229
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,380
We need this requirement

230
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,500
or this control to be implemented
throughout our estate.

231
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,185
It really doesn't matter
how it's implemented,

232
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:51,390
it matters that it's implemented

233
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,007
and we know that it's in place,

234
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:54,840
and it's doing it effectively, right?

235
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,310
Technologies may change,

236
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,353
but the outcome should be the same.

237
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,263
So let's put it all together.

238
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,710
Security doesn't care where your data is

239
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,500
and it doesn't care where
your workloads live.

240
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,630
It really-
- I got an idea.

241
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,580
You know, our supersonic
drone taco delivery program,

242
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,520
my Uncle Elroy's got a cloud provider,

243
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,110
he runs a cloud provider.

244
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,943
- Really?

245
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:22,560
- Yeah, yeah, man, it's in his basement.

246
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,470
- Does he comply with all
the security frameworks?

247
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,550
- No.

248
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,819
- Then no, we cannot use that.

249
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:29,652
So here-
- Whatever.

250
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:32,160
- We really want a cloud service provider

251
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,660
that is adhering to a lot of
the compliance frameworks.

252
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,080
Once you have established
which one of those requirements

253
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,940
you wouldn't have to align to

254
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,590
from that compliance frameworks,

255
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,140
you can drive that operational excellence.

256
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,420
So again, you really
don't have to focus on

257
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,000
what are the specific mechanisms in place

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,650
to drive those controls,

259
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,000
but that the controls are in place

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,420
and are acting efficiently.

261
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,553
And so it's outcomes, not implementation.

262
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,730
- So outcomes versus
implementation is something

263
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,990
that we start to see customers
become challenged with

264
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,880
when their growth starts to
expand into other clouds.

265
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,020
Because we want to have policies

266
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,560
that define

267
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:23,213
and control objectives, right?

268
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:27,490
And we want our development teams

269
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,400
to turn around and be able to
implement those effectively.

270
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,280
And one of the challenges is that

271
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,653
if you are kind of a small,

272
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,960
not even a small company,

273
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,550
if you're a company that's just operating

274
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,920
on a single cloud provider,

275
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
or maybe you are a company migrating

276
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,070
into cloud from on-prem,

277
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,020
you might end up with security teams

278
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,020
that have defined security policies

279
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,300
that include implementation, right?

280
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,420
So here's a good example
of something like that.

281
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,750
We've told our development teams,

282
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,750
for data that is classified
as internal, right,

283
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,430
we want you to store it on S3

284
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,330
with some given KMS encryption policy.

285
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,330
And for our development teams
that are operating in AWS,

286
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,930
this makes perfect sense.

287
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,120
We can deploy it, it's easy.

288
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,620
But what happens to our teams

289
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,500
that need to take that security policy

290
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,000
and go to another cloud
provider like Azure or GCP?

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,150
We now have created confusion.

292
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,890
And in that confusion,

293
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,620
you're gonna begin
overwhelming security teams

294
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,440
because your development
teams are gonna consistently

295
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,617
keep coming back and going,

296
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:48,810
"Well, wait a minute, what do you mean?

297
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,000
Is this gonna be okay? Is this okay?"

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,023
So instead,

299
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,270
we want to look at security policies

300
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,590
that still achieve our
security outcomes, right?

301
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,880
Here, with just a few
small tweaks to the policy,

302
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,290
we've now said,

303
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,420
internal data, when stored in cloud,

304
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,430
must be stored in an object storage

305
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:17,850
with the following types
of encryption, right?

306
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,420
If you look back a few years ago,

307
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,593
Stephen Schmidt,

308
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,697
he spoke on the top 10 things
to be doing in your AWS.

309
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,540
One of the things he talked about was

310
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,010
implicit policies, right?

311
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,610
Policies that are easy to
follow and easy to understand.

312
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,960
And this is where we've come to.

313
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,460
So now we have a policy
that achieves our outcomes,

314
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,883
can be applied anywhere,
including on-prem.

315
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,150
And then out of that,

316
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,420
we can begin creating
implementation guidelines.

317
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,410
And in fact,

318
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,880
those implementation guidelines

319
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,960
might come out of those
very same development teams

320
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,947
who then say,

321
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:03,387
"Here's how we did it and we
were approved by security."

322
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,410
So let's talk about common challenges.

323
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,830
A lot of what goes into this list,

324
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,210
it comes out of Luis
and I, and other folks,

325
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,523
our conversations with customers.

326
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,080
If you have got a challenge
that is not on this list,

327
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,090
I would love to talk to you after this.

328
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,380
I'd love to hear your voice

329
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,120
and understand what you're up against.

330
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,120
But we grouped these into the categories

331
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,840
mapped to the CSF.

332
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,510
So in protect,

333
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,120
starts with identity management.

334
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,830
You've got a bunch of places

335
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,570
where your developers have been approved

336
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,703
to run their workloads.

337
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,133
How do you identify,

338
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,730
how do they get there?

339
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,810
How do they authenticate?

340
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,983
What is your authn, authz
mechanisms look like?

341
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,400
Again, in the protect category
is data security, right?

342
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,380
There's gonna be a lot of data.

343
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,673
How do we manage it?

344
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,353
In detect is continuous monitoring.

345
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,100
You now have a lot of architecture.

346
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,553
You need to have visibility
into what's going on around it.

347
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,410
And in the respond category
is incident (clears throat),

348
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,210
yes, incident management (chuckles).

349
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,740
We need to be able to do
something when something occurs,

350
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,540
be it a security event,

351
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,570
be it a misconfiguration event,

352
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,970
be it simply something
that needs to be cleaned up

353
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,603
because our policies and
constraints have changed.

354
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,710
So when we look at this,

355
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,170
how and where to federate,

356
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,160
how do we get our users authenticated,

357
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,840
really comes down a lot
to centralized federation.

358
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,063
I need to know who is who.

359
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,440
When it comes to encryption and privacy,

360
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,590
we really are looking
at a lot of automation,

361
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,930
and we'll talk more in
depth about each of these,

362
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,513
but I need to control my data.

363
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,550
When we talk about visibility,

364
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,170
visibility really is gonna
become centralizing that event

365
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,490
and log data,

366
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,103
because I need to see what's going on.

367
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,280
And team skills and tools.

368
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,870
This one is gonna be,

369
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,350
maybe a little bit of the
more complex conversation,

370
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,490
but I need to look into specialized tools

371
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,080
or specialized teams

372
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,200
because I need expert people.

373
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,700
I need expert resources

374
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,433
that can help me manage all of the above.

375
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:50,524
And so,

376
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,520
centralize federation,

377
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,660
as we talk about this

378
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,813
and we get into each of these
categories a little deeper.

379
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,893
This is a kind of a
single source of truth.

380
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,830
We'll talk about what those
sources can look like,

381
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,150
but essentially,

382
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,680
we need to be able to make sure

383
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,010
that all of our cloud providers

384
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,920
and our on-prem resources are going back

385
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,023
to a single source of truth.

386
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,360
Automation can mean monitoring
configuration, right?

387
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Actively responding with
remediation around our data

388
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,340
and using cloud guardrails

389
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,213
and configuring them automatically.

390
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,870
Centralize data is,

391
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,550
eh, it's centralized logging.

392
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,753
It's pretty simple.

393
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,570
How we do that,

394
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,570
there's a lot of different
approaches, right?

395
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,573
And specialized teams and tools,

396
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,000
again, we'll get into this,

397
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
but essentially,

398
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,040
you might think about
specialized sub-teams

399
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,130
as part of your cloud
center of excellence,

400
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,120
or you might be looking at tools

401
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,670
to extend into the
different cloud providers

402
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,890
that you are operating with.

403
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,169
But let's start with identity
and access management.

404
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,180
- I think, technically,
we call this "Who's who."

405
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,380
- Yeah, yeah, the who's who.

406
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,280
- Who's who.

407
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,980
Okay, let's start with
identity and access management.

408
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,493
Again, the good news here is that,

409
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,030
we're tackling the challenge
that we already know

410
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,500
and understand, right?

411
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,470
Authentication. Who am I?

412
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,180
User system,

413
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,050
machine agent when it
comes to agentic AI, right?

414
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,030
Authorization. What am I allowed to do?

415
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,780
What are the permissions do I have?

416
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,530
And of course, accounting, right?

417
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,350
Tracking. What do I have access to?

418
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,860
What, in terms of data or
in term terms of resources,

419
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,540
do I have access to?

420
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,730
And I know a lot of you said

421
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,340
that you are already operating multicloud.

422
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,793
Who has already established a
centralized federation here?

423
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,390
A few of you.

424
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,750
This is one of the first things
we see some organizations do

425
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,310
when they go multicloud, right?

426
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,373
Because you want to have that
control in one single place.

427
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,550
And, probably, you're going to use things

428
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,050
like Microsoft Active
Directory, open-source LDAP,

429
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,270
Ping, Okta, something like that,

430
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,490
to give you that one source of truth

431
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,300
where you can control
your identity, right?

432
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,490
Where you have a better idea

433
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,170
of who's accessing your systems,

434
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,750
what those permissions
are to access the systems

435
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,680
and the data,

436
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,770
and keep track in case that
you have to investigate

437
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,633
or do some forensic analysis later.

438
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,200
So one of the first
challenges that comes up,

439
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,680
one of the first ones that
we see our customers tackle.

440
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,970
The recommended pattern
for these, in our opinion,

441
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,010
is going to be that single source of truth

442
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,580
for federated access for
multicloud resources.

443
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,290
So have that one place

444
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,520
where you manage all the identities

445
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,590
and all the access in
your multicloud state.

446
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,870
This is going to be enabled

447
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,960
by a third-party federation provider,

448
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,730
providing that identity source

449
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,793
that you need federation to work with.

450
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,640
So once you have this established,

451
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,310
it's going to give you two
very powerful benefits.

452
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,980
First one is that single point of identity

453
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,030
and access management, right?

454
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,640
Your team just to have
to focus on one place

455
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,980
to understand your estate,

456
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,180
who is who,

457
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,220
and what access they have.

458
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,123
And also,

459
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,880
it enables to maybe

460
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,520
put some higher controls and
standards in place, right?

461
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,960
For example, it might be
more palatable to users

462
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,470
to deploy things like
multifactor authentication

463
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,180
and complex passwords

464
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,770
because it's just one place

465
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,720
where they have to log on, right?

466
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,490
Your users are gonna be much happier.

467
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,550
They're gonna have one
place where they can log in

468
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,410
and they are not gonna have to log in

469
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,800
to disparate dashboards, disparate systems

470
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,520
to go through their day on operations.

471
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,800
So it's gonna be much easier for them.

472
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,660
And again, they might be more accepting

473
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,220
of tougher security controls

474
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,950
when it comes to users that
might be privileged, right?

475
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,183
Higher privileged users.

476
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,363
So really great benefits coming from this.

477
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,750
The tradeoffs are going
to be, in my opinion,

478
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,780
the first one is more of an investment

479
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,070
than a tradeoff, right?

480
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,710
You're going to have to
spend some time and effort

481
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,543
in the beginning.

482
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:38,490
Setting everything up is
going to be more complex

483
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,260
the more clouds you use,

484
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,060
and it's going to be exponential

485
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,140
if you have operating systems,
applications, portals, right?

486
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,363
It's going to create
that level of complexity.

487
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,790
It's gonna add up,

488
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,030
but it's gonna pay dividends
at the end of the day.

489
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,480
It's gonna save you time
from operational overhead,

490
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,930
managing all those different places

491
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,790
where your users may live.

492
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,790
And it's also gonna be a
lot easier for those users.

493
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,913
And the last three are
going to be related.

494
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,410
The reliance on a third
party is going to create

495
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,000
that dependency risk.

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,110
So you have to have really
tight break glass procedures,

497
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,110
so you can respond when
there's an outage, right?

498
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,650
So you're gonna have to be very clear

499
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,710
on how you are going to
operate if something breaks,

500
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,750
because there's that one place

501
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,370
where everybody's logging on

502
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,070
and where all the
administration's gonna happen.

503
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,240
So again, it's gonna be
a lot easier to sign on

504
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,530
and we're gonna be able

505
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,530
to avoid things like identity
sprawl, operational overhead.

506
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,320
So it's gonna be a lot easier
to establish your identity

507
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,240
and management once you centralize.

508
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,430
So now that you have an understanding

509
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,200
of who's logging onto your system,

510
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,950
let's see how to protect your data.

511
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,953
- So,

512
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,910
I think anybody that

513
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,280
is operating sort of on one cloud

514
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,930
probably starts to understand that

515
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,030
when data is all in one place,

516
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,410
it's a lot easier

517
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,530
and more straightforward
to control that data

518
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,920
because you can use

519
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:26,790
consistent guardrails and controls

520
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,130
within that cloud provider.

521
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,030
The challenge that becomes

522
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,410
in a multicloud environment is that,

523
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,470
that data begins to sprawl, right?

524
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,770
And we've got source code,

525
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,360
right, that has been deployed.

526
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,590
Maybe it's part of a workload,

527
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,313
maybe we're doing development
in virtual instances.

528
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,710
We have a ton of logs,

529
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,280
and those logs might contain
sensitive information,

530
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,253
they might have their
own data classification.

531
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,340
And we've got just simply data,

532
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,700
the data that our workloads work on.

533
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,700
And that can be anything from
PII, health... (stutters)

534
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:11,694
Yeah, yeah, there we go.

535
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:12,610
I was getting there.

536
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,020
And again,

537
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,730
what do we do about that data?

538
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,750
How do we understand it?

539
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,230
Well, we have policies that
are driving that, right?

540
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,500
So we have a data classification.

541
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,480
Whatever that works for you,

542
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,540
but you really should have
a data classification.

543
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,923
And if you don't,

544
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,020
you should go home

545
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,770
and really think about
having a data classification,

546
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,770
because that begins to define
things like data access.

547
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,490
Who can access that data?

548
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,983
Through what mechanisms
can they access it?

549
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,683
How is that data encrypted?

550
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,590
Do we need to apply a multilevel
approach to our encryption?

551
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,270
Is it just,

552
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,900
your kids' love letters
to their girlfriend

553
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,910
and we can just ROT13 that.

554
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,550
Who knows what ROT13 is?

555
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,960
Ooh, I'm dating myself.

556
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,793
Okay.

557
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,213
And what is the lifecycle look like?

558
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,950
Data gets left out

559
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,750
all the time, right?

560
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,080
We've seen a number of security events

561
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,760
over the years that have
occurred because data gets put

562
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,600
in a place without the
proper controls around it

563
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,490
and forgotten about,

564
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,120
only to be later discovered by someone

565
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,880
that we didn't want to discover it.

566
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,470
So this is why we need

567
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,403
to have these controls
classifications and access policies.

568
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,930
So how do we go about doing that?

569
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,610
Because it seems very daunting
to think about, you know,

570
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,610
you have development teams
ingesting data, producing data.

571
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,340
How do we get ahold of it?

572
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,640
The first place we want
to kind of start is

573
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,033
data security posture
management as an option.

574
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,803
Is anybody running a DSPM tooling now?

575
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,830
Okay, couple of people.

576
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,440
This is a very new space.

577
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,390
A number of really great
partner companies with AWS

578
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,750
have great product offerings around this.

579
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,610
They're here in the Village.

580
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,870
Make sure you go check them out

581
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,850
because data security posture
management can really give you

582
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,850
the tooling you need to go
understand how your data exists.

583
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,960
Right?

584
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,147
And that way, you can
start questioning like,

585
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:51,570
"Where do I need to go make changes?

586
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,630
Are my policies actually as
effective as they need to be?"

587
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,683
Things like that.

588
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,623
Cloud-native guardrails.

589
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,520
You should always question
what cloud providers offer you

590
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,473
in terms of protecting your data, right?

591
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,140
Obviously, I'd love to
tell you all about AWS',

592
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,550
from encryption to Macie and
tracking, finding your data,

593
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,612
and stuff like that.

594
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:22,170
But really, you should be
looking at those guardrails

595
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,510
and leveraging them where possible.

596
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,343
And then

597
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,680
questioning automation.

598
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,630
How can I pull automation in

599
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,410
to do things like monitoring
that data ingestion,

600
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,690
monitoring data migration,

601
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,133
monitoring how data is
being protected and managed?

602
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,060
Because then you can turn around

603
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,690
and assure compliance
for that data, right?

604
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,140
If you're under a compliance framework

605
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,890
that requires you to protect that data

606
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,650
because of its sensitive nature,

607
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,820
you're probably already
operating in this space

608
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,573
to assure that your data
is configured correctly.

609
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,750
And remediation.

610
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,610
If you go plug in something

611
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,123
like one of our DSPM partner tools,

612
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,460
you're probably gonna find a lot of stuff

613
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,610
that maybe needs remediation.

614
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,590
And the cool thing is,

615
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,323
when we talk about automation nowadays,

616
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,910
you know, even just a year or two ago,

617
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,870
I knew security teams that
would break out in cold sweats

618
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,340
when you told them that they
needed to write their own code

619
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,020
to do some of this automation.

620
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,550
But nowadays,

621
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,100
with agentic AI and vibe coding,

622
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,810
this is so much more approachable by teams

623
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,660
because this code can now get created by

624
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,613
literally anybody that can
write an effective prompt.

625
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,370
Find your prompt engineering
talk this week at re:Invent.

626
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,210
So what are the benefits out of this?

627
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,743
Well, DSPM is really streamlining
efforts in this space,

628
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,660
and that's great.

629
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,030
That means that it's one less thing

630
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,030
that security teams need to worry about

631
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,670
because tooling is emerging in this space

632
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,670
to really get a hold of
how your data is protected

633
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:32,670
and what controls are in place around it.

634
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,510
And automation adds efficiencies, right?

635
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,780
The story around automation
has always been the same.

636
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Automation adds virtual
people to your team, right?

637
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,180
One of my past roles,

638
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,170
we were a very small
security team of like four

639
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,760
or five people operating on
thousands of AWS accounts.

640
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,760
So embracing automation is
really a very powerful thing

641
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,693
for any security team.

642
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,350
There's some challenges
around this though,

643
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,690
and you're gonna hear some
of these kind of repeatedly

644
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,623
through this talk.

645
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,990
Cost.

646
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,823
Right?

647
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,240
Tooling comes with a cost to purchase,

648
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,320
might come with a cost to
bring in professional services

649
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,790
from that tooling company

650
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,200
to help get the most out
of the tool the fastest.

651
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,990
So there's budgetary questions

652
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,493
that you kind of have to have.

653
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,900
While I just said

654
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,690
that creating automation
has gotten easier,

655
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,180
there is still a complexity to it.

656
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,170
Deploying it,

657
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,450
making sure that your
automation is reaching

658
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,410
all the places that it needs to,

659
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,910
all the nooks and crannies that,

660
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,470
you know, to discover data

661
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,400
and work on any type of
remediation, things like that,

662
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,090
especially as you become
more and more distributed.

663
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,670
And guardrails.

664
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,660
While the native cloud-native
guardrails may be great,

665
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,680
you should be evaluating them
against your security policies

666
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,870
to question if there's gaps.

667
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,850
And when there are gaps,

668
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,420
you should be looking at
one of these other options

669
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,710
to fill that in.

670
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,500
Making sure that you meet the objectives

671
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,453
of your security policies.

672
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,980
So, Luis tell us about
centralized logging.

673
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,224
- Or, what's going on?

674
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:41,400
(Geoff laughs)

675
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,040
So let's talk about visibility,

676
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,623
because you can't secure
what you can't see, right?

677
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,230
And this is one other topics
that sound really easy, right?

678
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,880
Just centralize your
visibility and you'll be fine.

679
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,400
But putting this in place is
more complex than it sounds.

680
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,730
Again, the complexity
adds up exponentially

681
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,090
because we're not just talking
about logs from one cloud

682
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,290
adding another cloud,

683
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,170
but each cloud is gonna
have a tech stack, right?

684
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,710
So you're gonna be adding logs
from your operating system,

685
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,820
from your database,

686
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,350
from your applications, right?

687
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,550
So it's an exponential level of logs

688
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,460
that you have to ingest, consume, analyze,

689
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,000
and add that to the data
protection mechanisms

690
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,650
that Geoff mentioned
that need to be in place

691
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,000
to protect those logs.

692
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,793
It starts to get
complicated really quickly.

693
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,040
Still, our recommendation
is to centralize those logs,

694
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,440
but we'll talk through some
of the considerations, right?

695
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,940
So at the high level,

696
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,290
centralizing those logs

697
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,350
will give you the
visibility you need, right?

698
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,990
So one place to see everything

699
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,770
in your multicloud
environment is the way to go.

700
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,650
This is going to be, again,
easier said than done,

701
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,270
but if you have that visibility,

702
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,240
you'll understand your
multicloud environment.

703
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,700
You can create a security baseline

704
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,320
throughout your multicloud environment,

705
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,460
throughout your estate.

706
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,060
You're going to be able to
derive themes and trends.

707
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,920
You're going to have alerts

708
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,160
and notifications that are
going to be from everywhere.

709
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,550
And it's going to give you
the ability to respond faster

710
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,480
to events,

711
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,480
understand what happened with
a lot more context and nuance.

712
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,660
So having that visibility
in one place, it's great,

713
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,670
but we have some tradeoffs, right?

714
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,870
And that's on the next
screen I'll show you.

715
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,280
So for the recommended pattern,

716
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,710
that's centralized logging.

717
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,910
For the enablement,

718
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,140
we have a security information
and event management system.

719
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,780
So this is another place
where, like we talked,

720
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,140
you may be able to expand the
tooling that you already have.

721
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,580
And if you already have expertise,

722
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,830
it may accelerate the implementation

723
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,810
in your multicloud environment.

724
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,760
Again, who here is already using a SIEM

725
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,120
for their incident
response and monitoring.

726
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,953
Yeah.

727
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:03,000
So if you have that in place,

728
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,250
you're already halfway there,

729
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,083
but of course,

730
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,940
you're gonna have to
take those considerations

731
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,040
when it comes to how to implement it.

732
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,870
So let's talk about the tradeoffs first,

733
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,880
and we'll talk about the
considerations after.

734
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,750
So the benefits that are gonna
be provided are real, right?

735
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,850
You're gonna have that central visibility.

736
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,100
That one place to see everything

737
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,810
that's going on in your environment.

738
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,400
It's gonna give you the ability

739
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,530
to understand your
environment a lot better.

740
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,840
You're gonna be able to differ normal

741
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,530
from maybe suspicious
or anomalous behavior.

742
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,480
It's going to give you all
the information you need

743
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,413
in one place.

744
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,700
And it's going to be able to
help correlate across clouds

745
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,200
for that faster response.

746
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,310
So if an event happens,

747
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,820
you can respond really quickly
and know if it's an incident,

748
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,180
and then try to do any
remediation you need to have.

749
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,640
Again, the first trade
off in my mind is going

750
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,100
to be an investment.

751
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,720
You're going multicloud anyway,

752
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,230
so a lot of this complexity is
gonna be audited by default.

753
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,150
And so if you spend some time
and effort in the front end,

754
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,870
understanding what logs you
need, where you need them,

755
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,700
what visibility you really need.

756
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,970
It's not gonna be about
collecting everything

757
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,050
all in the same place,

758
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,890
like in one database or in
one lake, or in one cloud.

759
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,550
It's about whatever your decision is

760
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,960
of where you put that data,

761
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,700
be it central or diversify
throughout your cloud estate,

762
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,940
having one place to get
all that visibility, right?

763
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,740
So that complexity,

764
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,100
that analysis that you're
going to do on the front end is

765
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,620
going to pay dividends
in the backend, right?

766
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,870
Because it's gonna be
a lot easier to respond

767
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,020
once an incident is happening,

768
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,183
and that's when time really counts.

769
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,680
So cost is a true consideration here

770
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,420
because of data and tooling, right?

771
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,600
Like Geoff said, tooling is
gonna be a cost consideration.

772
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,840
So you may have to start
thinking through use cases

773
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,220
that you need

774
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,100
so that you know what data
is ingested by your tool

775
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,580
and you are not incurring too much cost.

776
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,730
Data is also gonna be a
consideration when it comes to cost.

777
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,610
You're gonna make sure that
you're not duplicating data.

778
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,560
If you are moving data around,

779
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,450
cost may also be an issue, right?

780
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,000
Transferring that data
around may be costly.

781
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,920
So you have to consider that.

782
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,370
And you may wanna push
data through its lifecycle

783
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,010
so that you are putting data

784
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,490
in least costly storage systems,

785
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,700
so that you don't incur that
cost that you don't need.

786
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,750
Right?

787
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,210
Timing is going to be
an important thing here

788
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,540
because you want to respond
as quickly as you can.

789
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,200
So getting those logs
ingested, aggregated,

790
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,600
analyzed fairly quickly, almost real time,

791
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,670
so that you can react to them,

792
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,450
is gonna be very important.

793
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,460
And then, of course, time sync.

794
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,220
You may have different clouds
in different time zones,

795
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,820
so you may have different time
that you have to coordinate

796
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,670
and correlate before an incident happens,

797
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,470
because any times queue

798
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,483
during an investigation can
throw the entire time life up,

799
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,763
right?

800
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:12,400
So it's gonna make

801
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,850
the incident response a lot harder.

802
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,540
So those are a lot of the
considerations you have to have,

803
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,610
to have all that visibility in place.

804
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,320
Let's talk about the expertise

805
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,730
and tools that are gonna help you

806
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,233
once you have that visibility.

807
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,460
- Every time we went over that last slide

808
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,670
and we got to the challenge of timing,

809
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,360
you always told me it
was my horrible jokes.

810
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,960
(Luis laughs)

811
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,793
All right.

812
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,730
So expert teams and tools,

813
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,890
this is kind of an interesting one for me.

814
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,153
Again, I have some sort of
unique experience in this.

815
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,740
I came from a large company
prior to coming to AWS,

816
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,573
and

817
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:07,530
we we were large enough that
when we started to embrace

818
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,800
and expand into other cloud providers

819
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,513
for a number of reasons,

820
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:17,700
we were building sub-teams, right?

821
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,613
And the benefit of the sub-teams is that,

822
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,310
you're creating a team
of dedicated experts

823
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,590
around that cloud,

824
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,840
and then that team

825
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,660
becomes part of your
cloud center of excellence

826
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,593
that then is able to provide
security and architecture.

827
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,550
Security and architecture expertise voice

828
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,280
to your development
teams, to your leadership,

829
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,383
whoever needs that type of input.

830
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,270
And it also means that the management

831
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,500
of that cloud provider is
pushed down into the sub-team

832
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,693
who knows it best, right?

833
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,710
I'm also keenly aware

834
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,950
that not a lot of companies can scale

835
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,540
in this way, right?

836
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,280
This is typically more

837
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,210
like a large enterprise-type solution.

838
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,450
I think a lot of customers
are more commonly

839
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,640
on the other side of this slide,

840
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,280
which is the dedicated tooling,

841
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,310
where you have security teams,

842
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,330
you have maybe a cloud engineering team

843
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,760
as part of your CCoE.

844
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,600
And what you need is tooling
to augment that team,

845
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,210
tooling that can provide a lot of the

846
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,070
inspection, monitoring,

847
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,940
and the general wellbeing
of your architectures

848
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,440
and workloads in each cloud.

849
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,570
Because there are a lot of tools.

850
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,073
We encourage you to look for
ones that are cloud-neutral,

851
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,490
or maybe it's fair to just say,

852
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,010
tools that operate in the cloud

853
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,133
that you are trying to run workloads on.

854
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,380
'Cause you don't wanna run
down the path of one tool

855
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,640
for one cloud provider,

856
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,840
one tool for another,

857
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,580
because that doesn't
really fix the problem

858
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,903
in this particular challenge.

859
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,240
You should also look at the
tools that you already have.

860
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,160
Customers buy a lot of tools
that have features in them

861
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,830
that don't get used simply
because they don't necessarily...

862
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,960
They don't have workloads that need them.

863
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,120
There's a lot of tools

864
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,120
for configuration security
posture management, right?

865
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,070
CSPM or the new CNAPPs.

866
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,210
A lot of customers that buy
those for their AWS workload.

867
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,680
But that tool is,

868
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,690
also, a lot of those tools are ready to go

869
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,310
for Azure and GCP.

870
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,143
And so,

871
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,540
we should be looking at tools

872
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,240
that can just simply be
extended that we already have.

873
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,550
Question, whether or not
we should be buying a tool,

874
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,860
whether we should be developing a tool,

875
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,250
or simply looking into the
open-source community for tooling

876
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,073
that can achieve what we need.

877
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,590
And partners,

878
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,150
there's lots of partners out there

879
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,330
that have a lot of deep
experience in this,

880
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,500
that are ready to come and
partner with you and become,

881
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,643
effectively, that extension
to your team in this space.

882
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,793
So,

883
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,293
the enablement around this is,

884
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,570
one way or another,

885
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,740
your folks are gonna need some training

886
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,540
or you're gonna need to
hire additional folks.

887
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,290
Because if you're operating
in one cloud provider

888
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,900
and you suddenly start
operating in another,

889
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,140
you're not necessarily gonna have

890
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,800
even the most foundational
expertise in that other cloud.

891
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,010
So we're gonna have to train

892
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,433
and potentially hire to scale for that.

893
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,640
Partner tools exist.

894
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,390
There's a lot of them here
out on the Village floor.

895
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,400
We should definitely be talking to them

896
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,703
if this is a challenge
that you're up against.

897
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,050
Looking at, again, the
tools that you have,

898
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,153
and can they be extended?

899
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,370
Open source.

900
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,690
Open source is a place

901
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,950
where a lot of the tools
come out of the box,

902
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,650
ready to operate on a
number of cloud providers

903
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,190
because it's sort of the
nature of open source

904
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,430
that you don't want to
be locked in to a vendor.

905
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,843
You don't want to be,

906
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,657
you know, forced to do things one way.

907
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,920
And so the open-source community,

908
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,880
especially when you look
at a lot of the services

909
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,713
that are out there.

910
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:04,546
Terraform.

911
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,660
Terraform is really
into not being locked in

912
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,920
to one cloud provider.

913
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,920
They want to be able
to allow you to deploy

914
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,330
and manage architecture
on any cloud provider

915
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,893
that you're running on.

916
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,430
And cloud native services, right?

917
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:28,290
So there's a lot of cloud-native services

918
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,670
that might perfectly meet
or exceed your requirements.

919
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,350
And that's great.

920
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,580
You should always, again,

921
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,660
be evaluating it against
your security outcomes,

922
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,820
your security requirements,

923
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,410
and finding out like,

924
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,610
are there gaps?

925
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,220
Do we need to fill something in

926
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,130
through one of these other mechanisms?

927
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,283
And I think the benefits here,

928
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,250
the person scaling approach,

929
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,920
the sub-team scaling approach

930
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,620
has got a tremendous amount of benefit

931
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,683
in terms of specialized cloud expertise.

932
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,333
But is, again, that challenge
that we talked about,

933
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,070
it has whether or not
you are deploying tools

934
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,050
or you're bringing people in,

935
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:23,490
your cloud center of
excellence is going to benefit

936
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,323
from that

937
00:44:24,323 --> 00:44:28,710
because you're gonna have
folks and tools attached to it

938
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,910
that are gonna be able to bring expertise

939
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:35,370
and additional controls

940
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,850
or monitoring to benefit
your development team.

941
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,683
And

942
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,870
the challenges.

943
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,150
I think the challenges are
probably pretty obvious

944
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:45,983
in this one.

945
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:46,816
So,

946
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,783
teams.

947
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:53,400
If you go the team route,

948
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,850
you can kind of get that
siloed effect, right?

949
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,410
Because

950
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,060
if Luis here is my AWS expert

951
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,580
and his team just does AWS,

952
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,950
and I'm the Azure expert

953
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,263
and my team just does Azure,

954
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:16,790
if something happens that we
need to withdraw workloads

955
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,840
from one of those cloud providers,

956
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,390
and we want one team or the other

957
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:25,200
to begin working on the other cloud,

958
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,213
that is gonna require training.

959
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,140
Their skills may become very siloed.

960
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,513
So it's just a challenge to consider.

961
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,770
It can be hard to find
that expertise natively.

962
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,970
So if you are looking

963
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,100
to hire people into your security realm

964
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:45,098
for it,

965
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,090
I think, most of us probably
in the security space are aware

966
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:56,090
that hiring security personnel
is difficult, at best,

967
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,510
right now.

968
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,560
But then to ask

969
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,550
for some very specific
expertise can become

970
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,753
really challenging.

971
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,370
Complex tool deployment.

972
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,470
Complexity kind of comes with the game

973
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,750
when we're talking about multicloud,

974
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,450
because now we have to deploy our tool

975
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,930
over a number of different cloud providers

976
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,343
and endpoints.

977
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,870
And obviously, management comes into play.

978
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,360
More tools, more people means

979
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,490
more resources required

980
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,723
to kind of keep them all
functioning smoothly.

981
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,200
Our manager deals with Luis

982
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,229
and I's petty arguments all the time.

983
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:41,423
- All the time.
- I'm just kidding.

984
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,660
Hey, so next steps.

985
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,983
So, next steps.

986
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,123
There's a lot of help available to you.

987
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:55,680
AWS has got a lot of folks internally

988
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,130
that are ready to come talk to you

989
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,783
about any of these challenges.

990
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,310
Your account team knows
how to find those folks,

991
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,780
folks like Luis and I

992
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,783
that are dedicated security specialists,

993
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,470
that have a lot of compliance

994
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,830
and architecture security experience.

995
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,880
And so if you're up against
one of these challenges,

996
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,443
talk to your account team,

997
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,595
pull in some of these resources.

998
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:30,510
We can definitely provide a lot of input.

999
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,820
- [Luis] We're gonna be
at the multicloud booth.

1000
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,670
- Yes, and there's a multicloud booth

1001
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,950
out on the Village floor.

1002
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,330
We'll be there tomorrow,

1003
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:42,150
but there's people there the whole time.

1004
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,103
Definitely come have a talk to 'em.

1005
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,770
It'll be security people,
operations people,

1006
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,700
FinOps,

1007
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,283
a number of different expertise.

1008
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,450
We also talked about frameworks.

1009
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,493
Again, this is really important.

1010
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,560
You might or might not be
surprised the number of customers

1011
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,660
that Luis and I talked to

1012
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,040
who struggled to even define
their own security policies,

1013
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,320
when great frameworks exist

1014
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,320
to really help start
guiding you in this space.

1015
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,570
So be sure to check these out.

1016
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,150
I mean, these are very super common,

1017
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,510
very well-known center
for internet security,

1018
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,573
the NIST CSF like we talked about earlier.

1019
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,780
Cloud Security Alliance has got a ton

1020
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,850
of stuff available to you.

1021
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:40,800
MITRE ATT&CK framework
is very cloud-agnostic.

1022
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,070
So they really have got
a lot of good information

1023
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,350
from a security perspective.

1024
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,340
ISO.

1025
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,060
ISO's got a ton of frameworks, 27k.

1026
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,180
But even in the AI and AI security space,

1027
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,030
which is emerging rapidly,

1028
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,273
they have new frameworks
that have been published.

1029
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,011
FedRAMP and FISMA.

1030
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,700
If you're in that space,

1031
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,070
you already know about 'em.

1032
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,670
You pretty much can't operate without 'em.

1033
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,503
And PCI.

1034
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:14,400
PCI is a great one to look at,

1035
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,780
even if you are not required
to be PCI compliant.

1036
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,850
They publish a ton of stuff.

1037
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,910
Lots and lots of auditors
and compliance folks know

1038
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,860
how to operate around PCI,

1039
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,810
and it provides a really good framework

1040
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,333
for a lot of this security.

1041
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,523
So, takeaways.

1042
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,240
Security requirements don't change.

1043
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,600
I don't care how awesome
the cloud provider

1044
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,610
that your uncle runs is,

1045
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:48,930
but you need to apply
your security policies.

1046
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,900
You need to understand
your security outcomes

1047
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,960
and you need to hold
true and fast to them,

1048
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,200
and evaluate anywhere that
you're gonna run workloads

1049
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,810
against those security policies.

1050
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,790
- [Luis] Start cloud agnostic, right?

1051
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,860
Start cloud neutral in high level

1052
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,013
so that you can drive those
requirements throughout.

1053
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,340
Remember to look at
outcomes, not implementation,

1054
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,570
when it comes to the high level,

1055
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,763
and then look at the implementation after.

1056
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,153
- Look at extending your tools.

1057
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,090
I mean most people,

1058
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,600
most companies already own tools

1059
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,470
that can be extended into
multiple cloud providers.

1060
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,400
So if you're starting to think about this,

1061
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,380
if you've started to move that way,

1062
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,430
if you're trying to
rope in some shadow ops

1063
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,163
that are going on in
other cloud providers,

1064
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,750
a lot of people already have
tools that are easily deployed

1065
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:49,983
to begin handling that.

1066
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,560
- [Luis] And finally, data matters, right?

1067
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,150
That data governance really matters.

1068
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,040
Understanding where your data lives,

1069
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,740
where it's transmitted,
where it's processed.

1070
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,640
Geoff talked about data
protection and mechanisms,

1071
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,470
automatic mechanisms to put in place

1072
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,640
to understand where data is,

1073
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,410
but also non-technical, right?

1074
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,080
Talk to your people,
understand data flows,

1075
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,730
understand what business
centers are using what data

1076
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,140
so that you can understand

1077
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,213
how to protect it more efficiently.

1078
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,510
- And you might want to
capture these with your phone.

1079
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,460
These are a couple of
really good resources

1080
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,413
that you can explore from AWS' end.

1081
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:34,800
The first one is the main
AWS multicloud landing page.

1082
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,400
This has got a lot of really
great information links

1083
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,400
to other resources within AWS

1084
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,100
that can help guide a lot of this.

1085
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,970
This page is rapidly growing with content

1086
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,250
as we ourselves are beginning

1087
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:55,943
to publish and develop helpful content

1088
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,150
for customers in the multiclouds.

1089
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,580
They're operating in multicloud space.

1090
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,440
And the other one is the blog.

1091
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,950
So just like we have a
number of other blogs,

1092
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,270
like for instance,

1093
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,090
the security blog that Luis
and I have published on.

1094
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,790
Multicloud has a blog that is going,

1095
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,450
that content is being
developed fairly quickly.

1096
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,403
So definitely check it out.

1097
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,900
And from Luis and I,

1098
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,500
we super appreciate you
taking the time to be here

1099
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,490
and listen to us,

1100
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,060
and we'd love feedback.

1101
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,590
So when you evaluate the session here,

1102
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,080
please let us know what you think,

1103
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,837
how we can develop this better for you.

1104
00:52:42,837 --> 00:52:46,770
And after this, we'll be right back there

1105
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,330
and we're happy to talk to anybody

1106
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,160
that wants to follow up on this.

1107
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,620
So, thanks very much.

1108
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,573
Enjoy the rest of your week.
