1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,169
Well, thank you everyone for joining us here

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,890
on Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,629
uh, where we're going to

4
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:08,089
be here to talk to you from SEM to SOC

5
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:10,329
building an AI native

6
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:12,689
security in the cloud with AWS.

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,310
I am Jen Reed. I'm a worldwide principal

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,408
security SA and I have with me

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,440
today. Hi, um, I'm

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,530
Manoj. Uh, I'm a product manager in the NextGen

11
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,309
SIM team and I lead the data in injure strategy.

12
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,370
Namab Solomon, uh, solution architect

13
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,769
to CrowdStrike for our AWS partnership.

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,348
All right. And so today what we're

15
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:35,418
here to talk about, um, we're gonna start

16
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:37,560
with just a little refresher for

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,179
those of you who may not be aware,

18
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:41,560
uh, what CrowdStrikes Falcon NextGen

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,319
SIM is.

20
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,829
Then we're going to dig a little bit deeper and I'll

21
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,098
come back and tell you guys about NextGen SIM

22
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:48,250
4. AWS

23
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,630
and what that all entails and then we will

24
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,929
follow that up with the Marketplace

25
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,029
play as you go which Rob will talk

26
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:56,340
a little bit about at the end.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,009
Throughout this presentation we're gonna have a few

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,009
demos, um, that we're going to

29
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,209
show to you guys so you can understand how all of this

30
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:03,829
works

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,409
and so without further ado I'm gonna

32
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,459
turn it over to Manosh.

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,290
Thanks Jen

34
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,349
Hello, everyone, uh, pretty excited here

35
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,588
to actually share some insights on

36
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:17,778
some cool innovations that we have done in Exchange

37
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,150
SEM specifically for AWS customers.

38
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,588
So I'll be going to the details, uh, as

39
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:23,329
Jen mentioned.

40
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:26,049
Uh, but before that, let's actually start

41
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,349
by talking about some statistics from

42
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,088
our global threat report.

43
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,750
Uh, AI is the flavor of

44
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,870
the season. Everybody talks about AI. AI is

45
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,448
changing everything around us

46
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,349
for the better.

47
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:40,000
But at the same time, it is also

48
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:43,370
enabling adversaries to actually

49
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,260
improve their game.

50
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:45,668
So,

51
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,588
this particular threat report gives us some

52
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,709
key insights that I want to actually gain

53
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:51,808
your attention towards.

54
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:52,730
So let's start

55
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:54,969
with the first aspect, which is speed.

56
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,778
So as for the for the report

57
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:58,980
that we had this year,

58
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,489
the breakout time that takes, the

59
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,588
amount of time the user actually the

60
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:04,290
threat actor

61
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,290
takes to

62
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,588
gain access and breakout

63
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,409
is under 48 minutes,

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,028
and it's reduced from 56 minutes from last

65
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:15,028
year. And what

66
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,229
we observed in one of our customers

67
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:17,778
was

68
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,099
the user was able to execute this, uh,

69
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,389
the threat actor was able to actually break out

70
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,469
in under 51 seconds, that

71
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,469
is less than 1 minute, and most of

72
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,909
the organization actually need take

73
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:31,028
more time than that to actually respond

74
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:31,990
to a normal alert.

75
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:34,679
Next

76
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,139
is about stealth.

77
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,960
Most of these threat actors are now become

78
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,080
more sneaky. They are very hard

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,788
to detect.

80
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,338
And what we observed is that

81
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,469
81% of all the

82
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:48,819
the threat

83
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,979
and the breaches

84
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,778
were done through without any malware. So

85
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,118
gone are the times when we would actually use

86
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:58,439
the malware signatures and the files, hashes and

87
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,800
everything else, the traditional way of detecting

88
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,153
users are. Actually relying, the threat

89
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:05,433
actors are actually relying on

90
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,094
using

91
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:09,153
phishing and sophisticated mechanisms

92
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:10,955
to gain credential access,

93
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,875
some, let's say cloud admin

94
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,104
access, and somehow figure a way to actually

95
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,014
run manual

96
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:20,194
operations to gain persistence in the environment.

97
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,675
They are no more using malware. They're using

98
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,585
actually on keyboard manual

99
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,993
operations and legitimate tools to actually gain

100
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:31,058
access. Another

101
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,588
important aspect is sophistication.

102
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,558
So AI is another tool that they're leveraging,

103
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,899
and what we have observed is state actors,

104
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,379
state sponsored threat actors like famous

105
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,460
Colima actually are using to up

106
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,129
their game.

107
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,800
For example, they had.

108
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:48,929
Attacked 320 organizations

109
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,969
in one year and they have doubled the

110
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,050
number of phishing

111
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,949
campaigns that they are doing in the last.

112
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,169
The last few months

113
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,028
and we have seen that the cloud attack

114
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:02,610
itself has increased by 136%.

115
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,469
So what does this actually tell us?

116
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:05,889
That

117
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,550
AI is actually enabling these

118
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,300
threat actors to become faster,

119
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,409
difficult to detect, and more sophisticated

120
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:14,389
to identify.

121
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:16,928
So we need to use AI to actually up our

122
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:19,298
game and use it to actually defend

123
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:20,369
against these attackers.

124
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,658
So before we go into the details of how

125
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:25,918
falcon connection SIM would help with the exact

126
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:27,918
problem that I just mentioned, let's understand

127
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,238
how these threat actors actually behave. I'm assuming

128
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,668
most of you are familiar with this,

129
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,117
but just for uh knowledge purpose,

130
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:36,218
let's go through an exercise.

131
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,617
So in this case, we're talking about

132
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,959
a threat actor, scattered spider. Many of you may

133
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,747
be aware of it,

134
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:44,117
and we have been tracking this threat actor for a

135
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,660
while. What they,

136
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,439
what they prefer to do is use phishing

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,319
to actually gain initial access.

138
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,730
They somehow uh uh get access

139
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,389
of a, let's say cloud admin user,

140
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:56,678
use that to actually infiltrate into the

141
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,439
management or the control plane.

142
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,920
And then execute commands, for example, to

143
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,108
create uh a

144
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,480
new user, create a new VM,

145
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,119
uh, and then actually create, uh,

146
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,160
for example, download tools um

147
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,379
like RMM tools which are very legitimate

148
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,028
and then create persistence and create a backdoor

149
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:15,619
entry to exploit further,

150
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,119
let's say through ransomware attacks or to, to

151
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,439
do data exfiltration.

152
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,160
So they actually move across your

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,619
environment very quickly.

154
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,379
So that actually requires, so what is the problem

155
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,160
that we see here?

156
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:30,100
If you have to actually defend against these attacks,

157
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:32,350
you need visibility across multiple

158
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,869
domains.

159
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:35,189
You need visibility into your endpoints, into your

160
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,670
cloud, your identity, and other areas

161
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,028
within your organization

162
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:40,670
to actually defend properly.

163
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,819
And that's not

164
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,160
something that traditional SIMs and

165
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,500
tools that exist in the market are capable of.

166
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,069
So to summarize, AI definitely

167
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,899
is improving our life day to day,

168
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,509
making it much more easier, but it is also

169
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:58,088
enabling the adversaries to

170
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,509
uh gain access into our environment and

171
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,809
become more sophisticated.

172
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,108
So we keep asking this question,

173
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,588
and whenever we especially talk to our customers,

174
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:09,389
do your existing tools have the

175
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,449
necessary capabilities to address this challenge?

176
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,379
So whenever we have this conversation, we actually

177
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,959
identify and we come across

178
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,040
common scenarios and common frustrations

179
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,879
which we hear over and over again. First,

180
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,500
it is too, too many different tools that they

181
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,709
have to manage. They do not have a unified platform.

182
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,338
They need to actually access multiple tools and

183
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:30,160
make it work.

184
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,980
That means the users are spending a lot of time

185
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,059
figuring out uh how to

186
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,579
access the tools, how to integrate them.

187
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,500
So fragmentation is an exact problem.

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,778
Too many,

189
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,869
too many uh false positives,

190
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:45,540
too much noise to actually uh uh

191
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,720
analyze and figure out the true positives. It's

192
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,899
uh taking a lot, a toll on the

193
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:50,858
security analyst.

194
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,709
Again, response actions are too delayed.

195
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,319
They do not have necessarily the mechanisms

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,519
to act at the speed at which

197
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,980
these threat actors are performing.

198
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,069
So let's understand how

199
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,569
NextGen SIM is evolving to

200
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:06,910
actually address these challenges.

201
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,540
So

202
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,189
So the first, uh,

203
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,528
generally the question that I keep asking, SIM is not

204
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:16,649
a new technology, it has been there for decades. I have been

205
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,088
in the SIM space for over 15 years now,

206
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,028
and it has evolved, definitely.

207
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,720
So the question that I keep getting is what's

208
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,009
different about Falcon Nexgen SIM

209
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,350
versus the traditional SIMs that exist in the market.

210
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,720
And the first answer that I generally give is

211
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,178
a unified platform. Traditional SIMs

212
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,160
actually consider detection

213
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,778
and response as two separate functions

214
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,858
generally executed by two different tools

215
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:42,670
altogether,

216
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,178
whereas Falconnection SIM is a true

217
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:47,509
platform where it provides one single

218
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,939
workspace for detection,

219
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,910
investigation, and response. It does not differentiate

220
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,519
with it.

221
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:53,959
It truly

222
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,129
operationalized security operations or centralizes

223
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,329
it and unifies it.

224
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,858
So let's understand how this is actually achieved.

225
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:02,838
So

226
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,488
I'm not sure how I I think I saw

227
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,028
at least 50+ hands

228
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,720
of existing CrowdStrike customers, so you most probably

229
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,769
would have your endpoint solutions

230
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,290
deployed.

231
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,809
So with traditional SIMs,

232
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,369
one of the key challenges that you need to

233
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,608
perform is move all your endpoint data

234
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,298
and your identity data into a third party SIM.

235
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,439
You have to export the data.

236
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,869
That's not needed with an exchange SIM. It's a true platform.

237
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,069
Even if you're Falcon Insight or Endpoint

238
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,219
Solution, you have the SIM capabilities built

239
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,168
into the platform.

240
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,869
Second, uh, it actually can

241
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,869
respond immediately using the sensors.

242
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,008
You don't, you can actually block uh

243
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:42,548
a

244
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,268
a ransomware attack

245
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,168
rather than actually detecting it later once the harm

246
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,369
is done, or you could actually block a brute

247
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,229
force attack using the sensor

248
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:53,788
instead of detecting it after multiple days.

249
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,408
Plus we have a fusion workflow uh

250
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,447
powered by AI which allows you to automate

251
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,609
most of the response actions powered by

252
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:03,249
Charlotte which provides agentic workflows,

253
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,788
autonomous response, and automated

254
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:06,428
triage.

255
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,129
I'll go into the details of this in the next coming slides.

256
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,899
So the first important aspect of the takeaway

257
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,320
is a unified platform.

258
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,798
It's not a standalone single solution

259
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,178
or a siloed solution. It's a platform for

260
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:20,139
Falcon. Sorry,

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,940
Falcon, it's a uh platform

262
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,479
uh solution in every Falcon module.

263
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,690
So let's go into more details. The next

264
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,989
important question that I keep uh

265
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,690
um asked more often is what

266
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,509
exact data should I bring in

267
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,369
to actually get the coverage?

268
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,389
And our answer always is you need the data

269
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:40,928
that you need to actually

270
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,849
do your uh basically stop breaches.

271
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:45,989
You just need that right amount of data.

272
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,928
So that is a core principle where we differentiate

273
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,119
ourselves from other SIMs.

274
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,469
Instead of actually mandating

275
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,029
and ingesting logs indiscriminately,

276
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,369
our focus is on getting the most

277
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,529
important data set so that you can actually

278
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,418
stop your breaches.

279
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,129
Now what do I mean by that?

280
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:04,700
So with Falcon

281
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:05,619
platform,

282
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,798
We out of the box provide coverage in terms

283
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:10,359
of threat intelligence,

284
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:11,450
exposure,

285
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,080
endpoint, cloud,

286
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,979
identity, and IoT.

287
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,460
They are already available without any additional

288
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,178
cost. We also provide a mechanism

289
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:22,298
inside NextGen SIM which allows you to seamlessly

290
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:24,460
ingest third-party data through out of the box

291
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,580
integrations which we call as connectors,

292
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:27,529
passes,

293
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,048
and we now acquired a new data ingestion

294
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,259
pipeline, which allows you to stream real-time

295
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,379
data into NextGen SIM.

296
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,460
So instead of actually

297
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:37,599
asking the users to ingest

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,200
uh indiscriminately, our focus is

299
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,139
making sure that you bring the right data

300
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,639
and augment already available data

301
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,700
inside Falcon platform.

302
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:48,479
So that's another core principle where we differentiate

303
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,519
ourselves from other SIMs.

304
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:51,879
The third,

305
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,269
AI. AI is an uh

306
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:56,798
uh is a, I would say a tool that we use

307
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:59,038
inside Falcon platform at every step.

308
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,479
We have a workflow designed for

309
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,279
analysts

310
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,239
so that they can actually perform detection,

311
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,158
investigation and response in, in a very efficient

312
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:09,320
manner. So let's

313
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,710
understand how this actually happens.

314
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,029
The whole journey for a for an

315
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,139
analyst starts from analyzing

316
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,759
the uh uh the appropriate alerts. How do

317
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,428
they do that?

318
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,239
We have out of the box machine learning algorithms

319
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,519
which allows us to risk score

320
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,840
any given alert, assign it, and

321
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,000
surface it for the analyst to actually

322
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,500
focusing, focus on the right

323
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,379
high priority alerts that he needs to work on

324
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,190
instead of actually working across all the

325
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
sea of noise that he is provided.

326
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,000
So that and then again, um

327
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:41,700
AI

328
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,279
provides uh again, Charlotte AI

329
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,678
enables automated triaging

330
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:49,200
so that additional information

331
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,359
and appropriate insights is provided

332
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,619
for the user so that they can actually

333
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,700
perform the necessary steps to remediate

334
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,479
a risk.

335
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:59,538
Third, we actually provide a workbench.

336
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,649
Where users, security analysts and the SOC team

337
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,690
members can collaborate on a given area

338
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,690
we call that an incident workbench.

339
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,119
It is actually supercharged by

340
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,369
Charlotte AI, providing insights at

341
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,489
regular intervals at the right point

342
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,918
of time, providing insights, suggestions

343
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,288
and recommendations of how to remediate

344
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:18,808
the risk.

345
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:20,168
And

346
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,769
all of this is built on top of

347
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,469
AI powered Fusiona platform

348
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,269
which allows you to automate

349
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,668
your responses within CrowdStrike

350
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,960
and outside using integrations,

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,279
agentic workflows,

352
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,250
playbooks, and case management.

353
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:39,479
So to summarize, basically,

354
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,279
we have a unified platform.

355
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,509
We focus on bringing the right data

356
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,750
instead of quantity. We focus on

357
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,989
quality and relevance.

358
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:49,908
We actually have an

359
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:51,369
AI powered

360
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,590
threat investigation workflow which makes

361
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,590
the life of a security analyst

362
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,830
much more simpler and easier so that they can

363
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,109
focus on the right alerts.

364
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,119
Now you don't have to take my word for that. We

365
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,989
actually have evidences because

366
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,119
over thousands of large customers

367
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,489
across different industries,

368
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,750
whether it's healthcare, whether it is

369
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,369
tech or manufacturing, have actually

370
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:18,168
leveraged the capabilities of Nexgen within 1

371
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,369
year of our launch and have transformed

372
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,529
their sock. They're not simply replacing

373
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:23,200
the tools,

374
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:25,548
they're actually consolidating

375
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:26,308
their stack.

376
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:29,590
The security stack, they are eliminating

377
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,619
point tools, and

378
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:33,798
they are able to use the AI

379
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,259
built into our platform to

380
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:38,259
actually empower the security analyst.

381
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,279
So, let's look at some more stats

382
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,340
to just cement what I just stated.

383
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,609
Based on the analysis of all our existing

384
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,649
install base, what we have observed

385
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,330
is that our CrowdStrike customers

386
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,450
are able to consolidate over 15

387
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,279
plus tools

388
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,729
and have a standardized security

389
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:58,250
stack,

390
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,690
making it seamless for the security users

391
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,330
and soft operations to execute.

392
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,190
What we have also observed is we have been

393
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,269
able to reduce false positives by 95%.

394
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:10,779
We have been able to ensure

395
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,859
that security analysts are focusing

396
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:15,229
on the most critical alerts needed

397
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,450
for their organizations.

398
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,269
And most importantly, it is built

399
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,808
at a speed and scale that

400
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,969
is needed for today's time and for the future.

401
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,719
In fact, the statistics that I have here,

402
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,629
which says 11 petabytes a day,

403
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:30,928
is pretty old. We are growing on

404
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:33,129
a day to day basis, and today we have crossed 20

405
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:33,928
petabytes a day.

406
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,279
The same is also actually

407
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,710
um Uh,

408
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,500
for example, not only have the statistics,

409
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:43,820
uh, uh,

410
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,840
support my assertion, but what we have also

411
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,279
seen that industry has recognized

412
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,479
these aspects also.

413
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,190
We have been named as a leader within a year in

414
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,320
Giga's Sem radar report.

415
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,869
We have been also awarded the Innovation

416
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:59,918
Innovators Award, and we've been already

417
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:01,879
in a visionary quadrant in Magic,

418
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,918
uh, Gartner's magic quadrant this year.

419
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,710
So basically,

420
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,658
it summarizes the benefits of Falcon Nction SIM.

421
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,330
Now you may be actually thinking and

422
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,369
wondering how is it relevant for

423
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,080
AWS customers and what did we do differently.

424
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,859
What the capabilities that I just described

425
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:22,019
about Falcon Nexction SIM is relevant for

426
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,379
every CrowdStrike customers.

427
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,058
But what we did by partnering

428
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,190
with AWS is to actually build

429
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,619
an experience curated for the AWS

430
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,168
users.

431
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,590
So, we are going to elaborate in more detail with

432
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,859
demos about it, but let me start with some

433
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,369
critical use cases.

434
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:39,558
So what are we trying to solve here?

435
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,950
So one of the key challenges, which I assume most of

436
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,070
you would agree is that

437
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,538
actually uh is a challenge that you may be facing

438
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:47,899
today is first,

439
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,229
fragmented tools.

440
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,729
So this is not specific to just enterprise customers.

441
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,849
We have observed this with startups and small

442
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:55,399
customers,

443
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,729
uh, SMBs where you end up having

444
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,808
multiple tools. You have a tool for endpoint, you have

445
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,849
one for cloud security, you may have

446
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:03,489
one for identity and so forth.

447
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,408
You need to work across all of them.

448
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,928
So that that introduces additional latency

449
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,029
and overhead for every security analyst.

450
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:12,840
Next,

451
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,479
limited context, the big picture

452
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:16,359
problem.

453
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,139
Most of the tools actually lack the necessary

454
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,619
context needed for a security analyst

455
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,940
to make the right decision and take action.

456
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:26,038
What do I mean, what do I mean by that?

457
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,779
So let's take an example. So whenever there is an

458
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,820
incident, there is an alert, we would like to

459
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
understand the assets related to

460
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,009
that particular event,

461
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,229
who's the owner,

462
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,918
what a sensitive data is actually.

463
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,250
Either stored in that particular asset or

464
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,889
linked to it,

465
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,369
what is this will allow us to understand the

466
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,950
impact of the possible threat.

467
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,668
That information is not available in traditional

468
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:49,808
sense. All solutions are point solutions that we

469
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,808
have. Third, the systems

470
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:52,619
are disconnected.

471
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,940
The security signals are not correlated

472
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,119
across domain and requires manual analysis.

473
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,899
So it's, it's like piecing a

474
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,940
puzzle every time you see an alert because you need to

475
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,519
figure out

476
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,259
if an alert in cloud and identity are

477
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,459
related to each other or not, and user needs to do this

478
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,598
manually. This all leads

479
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,078
to delayed response,

480
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,400
increased mean time to respond and detect.

481
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,049
So what we ideally need is to move

482
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:19,910
away from a fragmented security

483
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,689
to an integrated security.

484
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,529
So instead of having multiple tools, you need

485
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,549
a unified solution, a platform

486
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,449
which brings all these tools together.

487
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,029
Instead of doing manual analysis, we

488
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:34,250
need automated detection and correlation

489
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,588
where security signals from different

490
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,969
domains are correlated

491
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,088
out of the box.

492
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:42,739
And we need a system which can actually

493
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,858
add the context needed

494
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,939
for security analysts to do the investigation.

495
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:49,920
And streamlined response

496
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:52,259
and response at speed is what is

497
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,259
needed for an ideal solution to work.

498
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,358
So, a lot of theory.

499
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,608
A lot of concepts, but it was important to

500
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,650
set the context so that you understand what is the

501
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,449
problem that we are trying to solve.

502
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:08,588
Now let's actually see what we have done differently

503
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,809
to address this use case specifically for

504
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:11,930
AWS customers.

505
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,000
So we have the Falcon Xion SIM.

506
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,368
Built for enterprises,

507
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,039
we have partnered with AWS to make sure that

508
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,449
it can be enabled for SMEs and

509
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,489
startups seamlessly and

510
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:26,848
integrated into AWS services.

511
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:29,739
In a simplified manner which

512
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,489
removes any manual intervention,

513
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,160
provides automation

514
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
such that you can actually start seeing value

515
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:37,799
within minutes of subscription.

516
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,759
You see the data coming in, triggering detections

517
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,140
in a matter of minutes.

518
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:45,118
As part of this, what we have done is integrated into

519
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,000
the AWS Cloud trade,

520
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,739
security hub, and guard duty to begin with.

521
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,880
We launched this offering on

522
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:53,989
first of December here at reinvent.

523
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,660
We'll go into the details of the technical aspects. Jen

524
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,729
will be actually going into the details of what

525
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:01,729
we did at the background to make all of this

526
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:03,930
work. But at Short, what

527
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,130
we are able to do is, as soon as you

528
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,140
configure or subscribe to file

529
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,779
Connection SIM,

530
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,489
we have services built in to

531
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,969
integrate into these AWS services

532
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,549
and bring in real-time

533
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,739
alerts from your guard duty, cloud

534
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:20,868
trail, and security hub,

535
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,670
automatically detect

536
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,390
and Uh, uh,

537
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,189
and

538
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,680
show the alerts in your detection console,

539
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,489
respond to those triggers automatically.

540
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,449
All of that done in minutes.

541
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,709
I will skip the technical details and

542
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,578
let Jen go into the details,

543
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:39,650
but let's

544
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,309
see how this particular solution

545
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:44,630
will actually work in a real

546
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,689
world example.

547
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,170
So let's take an example of a threat actor

548
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,739
by the name Curly Spider.

549
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,949
Uh, specializing in

550
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,029
finance and e-crimes.

551
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,509
So basically their motto and uh is

552
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,779
very similar to the scattered spider, uh,

553
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,949
or the, I would say the tactics are very similar

554
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,068
to the uh scattered spider. What

555
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,509
they do actually is rely on phishing.

556
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,598
Very sophisticated campaigns to get credentials.

557
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:10,049
It all starts from there.

558
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,920
Once they gain initial access,

559
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,949
they create persistence by creating

560
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:16,670
new users, create, uh, launching a VM,

561
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:19,289
uh, downloading necessary tools, all looking

562
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,259
as legitimate.

563
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,769
Now if this is a scenario that is happening in your cloud

564
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,309
environment, let's say AWS,

565
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,209
how does this solution help you detect that?

566
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,920
So as you can see, there are multiple services

567
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,160
in play. AWS already has

568
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,390
necessary detections in place in different

569
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,489
aspects. Cloud trail, for example, would

570
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,299
detect unusual login patterns.

571
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:40,719
Guard duty is going to detect a

572
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:42,189
Suspicious

573
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,309
privilege escalation. So whenever

574
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,868
the threat actor tried to create an IM profile

575
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:49,229
with admin privileges, it will detect, trigger

576
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:49,910
an alert.

577
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,219
And similarly, security hub would detect any misconfigurations

578
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,209
or scenarios where

579
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,588
there are overly permissive network

580
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,289
access rules.

581
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,150
So these alerts are already coming from AWS

582
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,838
services into NextGen SIM

583
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:03,789
in near real-time manner.

584
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,160
At the same time,

585
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,519
Falcon modules are also able

586
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,578
to detect other

587
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,039
signals, for example, other scenarios. For

588
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,140
example, Nexgen SIM would generate

589
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,640
an alert for unusual RMM activity.

590
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,118
So whenever it sees an RM tool activity

591
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:18,640
in

592
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,400
in a node which is suspicious, it is going to

593
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,420
generate an alert.

594
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:25,400
Similarly, it generates an alert for any data exfiltration

595
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,539
pattern that it sees

596
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,848
which is attempted by the threat actor,

597
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,108
and also generates an alert for any

598
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,199
curl download operations.

599
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,759
The interesting part is it is already

600
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,059
taking response actions

601
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,719
as soon as it sees this behavior, but I'll get

602
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,789
into it. But before doing that,

603
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,318
all of these alerts came from different services,

604
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
but NextGen SIM is able to correlate all

605
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,140
of them as

606
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,489
a single threat activity,

607
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:54,459
assign it to a single case.

608
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,489
Use Charlotte AI to provide a summarized

609
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:59,118
view of what that means,

610
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,689
recommendations of what steps you need to take

611
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:02,650
to mitigate that,

612
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,729
and also trigger any automated

613
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:07,779
response actions to stop these threat

614
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:10,250
actors. For example, it will remove or

615
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,250
restrict the access of the user that was

616
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,868
created.

617
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,729
Isolate the VM that was generated

618
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,608
which was provisioned. All of these actions will be

619
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:21,809
automatically triggered by the fusion

620
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:22,809
saw response action.

621
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,098
So this is what we are launching

622
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:27,358
here, where

623
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,380
we have an completely automated solution

624
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,539
which is able to correlate alerts

625
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:34,390
from AWS,

626
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,739
from Falcon modules, and any other

627
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,890
third party modules and give you a

628
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,719
complete picture.

629
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,160
So let's actually see this

630
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,140
in a demo in real action.

631
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,368
So we'll take the same example that I talked

632
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,449
about. We're using a recorded demo, so I'll just

633
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:52,130
voice over it.

634
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:55,500
So we have Curly Spider who has already gained

635
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
access, and they have actually

636
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,549
uh uh

637
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,380
logged into the control plane, created a

638
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,420
new user.

639
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,420
Uh, they generated SSS

640
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,769
keypads and they also provisioned a VM

641
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:10,689
and also created a new user

642
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,209
for that VM with admin privileges.

643
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:15,769
So as soon as all of these operations are done, out

644
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,088
of the box integrations in Nextgen SIM

645
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:20,289
will bring in all the necessary security

646
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:22,650
signals from all the

647
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,009
required AWS services.

648
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:26,709
And will be able to detect all the

649
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:27,529
activities

650
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,630
and the API activities

651
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,009
and correlate all of them together. For example,

652
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:35,189
there is an out of the box detection which will

653
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:36,890
trigger an alert on the suspicious

654
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,709
excess privilege activity the

655
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,509
user performed.

656
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,368
It will also identify.

657
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,650
The EC2 operation that was performed.

658
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,410
And all of these are correlated

659
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,578
because it has the necessary context. It is able

660
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:52,729
to identify the detection that happened

661
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:55,209
at the cloud and identity

662
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,368
and correlate them at real time and

663
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,469
generate a detection. And as soon as it does,

664
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,150
it automatically triggers

665
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:03,750
a preconfigured response workflow

666
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,160
which will take the necessary actions to stop

667
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,828
the breach

668
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:09,309
by restricting the access and

669
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:11,250
stopping the VM from creating.

670
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,900
Charlotte AI at the same time provides all the

671
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,689
necessary insights and summary

672
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:18,489
for the analyst to work

673
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,949
on and perform additional

674
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:23,689
investigation. It will provide all the associated asset

675
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,789
information, it provides recommendation that the

676
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:26,709
user can follow.

677
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,868
It is also very easy for the security analysts

678
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,910
to perform the investigation right here at

679
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,170
the Workbench. So this,

680
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,588
so they can select any entity and actually

681
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:37,670
go and look at every security

682
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,088
event associated with that.

683
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,299
The solution also comes with out of the box

684
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,459
detection rules and dashboard that provides

685
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:47,239
you a complete unified view of all the activities,

686
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,279
all API

687
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:51,140
uh queries or API

688
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,640
invocation that is happening in the system.

689
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,219
So AWS and Falcon Nixion

690
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:58,519
seem together with this integration is able

691
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,088
to. Perform continuous

692
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:03,250
cloud detection and response as

693
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,910
a continuous operation

694
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,759
and is able to detect and

695
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,588
remediate

696
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:10,848
within seconds, in near real time.

697
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:13,410
So that's a solution that we are

698
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,939
proposing and uh pre uh

699
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,029
launching here and is available for customers

700
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,449
to actually benefit from.

701
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:21,989
So with that, we'll go into the details of

702
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,189
how this is all made possible and we'll welcome

703
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,469
Jen to share more details.

704
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,279
You might be wondering

705
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,519
how did we make this easy.

706
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,479
So 6 months ago

707
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,000
when, um, we proposed this

708
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,170
to the CrowdStrike team of,

709
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,640
you know, what we want to do is make SIM easy

710
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:42,439
and the problem was that SIM isn't easy,

711
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:44,640
but what if we could make it easy,

712
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,449
uh, because at AWS we

713
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:48,459
really understand.

714
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,334
How to really automate and simplify

715
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:53,515
the onboarding of AWS

716
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:56,164
organizations and AWS accounts and resources.

717
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:58,614
If we take that and integrate

718
00:25:58,614 --> 00:25:59,354
it with

719
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:01,193
how what CrowdStrike's really good

720
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:03,755
at, which is threat detection and response,

721
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,854
and we marry those together, I

722
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:08,045
really believe that we can make SIM

723
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,035
easy and that's what we've launched.

724
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,969
And so what I'm gonna do today is talk a

725
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,348
little bit more for the existing customers

726
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:16,150
of CrowdStrike,

727
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,618
how we made that easy for you within

728
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,900
the Falcon console,

729
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,670
and then I'll take a step back for that and actually

730
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,368
explain what we launched on November 19th

731
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:26,809
that makes that happen.

732
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,858
And then I'm going to talk about for new customers,

733
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,949
how you discover it, how that integrates

734
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:33,670
with AWS Security Hub,

735
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:36,890
then how that integrates with Marketplace,

736
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:39,390
and if you haven't used the CrowdStrike console

737
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,009
and you're brand new to CrowdStrike,

738
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,509
how we make that onboarding experience

739
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:46,130
easy through the AWS Marketplace

740
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,088
so you don't have to start by learning

741
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,479
the the Falcon console,

742
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:52,130
but you can actually start

743
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,983
by deploying. And then it will pivot you right

744
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:57,025
into the Falcon console and show

745
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,005
you how to make use of that data.

746
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:00,904
And more importantly,

747
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,265
AI investigator is part of that. So

748
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:03,963
if you

749
00:27:04,384 --> 00:27:06,535
or your team are new to

750
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:08,634
incident response or, uh, or an

751
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:10,785
analyst team, so maybe you have some cloud sec

752
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:13,443
ops team members who aren't necessarily analysts,

753
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:16,064
it gives you a really good way to enable

754
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,184
them to understand what they're seeing and

755
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:19,824
what next steps they should take.

756
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,049
So how did we make that easier? How

757
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,170
did we make that simplification journey

758
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,328
easier for, uh, the

759
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:30,140
existing CrowdStrike customers? Well,

760
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,130
within the Falcon console,

761
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,489
uh, there is a Quick Start

762
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:35,660
for AWS.

763
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,390
And so what this is, is it's a, um,

764
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,269
inside of the data connectors page,

765
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,108
there is a button

766
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:45,269
that says Quick Start for AWS.

767
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,088
And when you click that, that's going to take you into an

768
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:50,118
experience that shows you cloud trail, guard

769
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:50,670
duty,

770
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,670
um, and security hub. But

771
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:55,209
for those of you who maybe are a CrowdStrike customer

772
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,828
NextGen Sim, but you felt very overwhelmed,

773
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,489
uh, by onboarding AWS because

774
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:02,568
the truth is it can be a little difficult

775
00:28:02,568 --> 00:28:04,750
because our best practice

776
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,630
is to have a multi-account structure.

777
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,618
And with that, we have AWS organizations.

778
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,239
So for a security team

779
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:12,479
that maybe isn't

780
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,019
trained in AWS, it can be really, really

781
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:16,299
challenging to figure out,

782
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,900
well, how do I connect? Where do I connect

783
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,949
that to, and what's the data that I need.

784
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,000
And so for that, we made that easy

785
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,779
by giving you a button that says, connect

786
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:28,000
my AWS organization to the management

787
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,140
account. You provide that management

788
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,160
account information.

789
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,608
And then with that, it's going to then

790
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:35,900
connect to AWS and start

791
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,439
to pull in that information and do that automated

792
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:41,358
asset discovery of the AWS

793
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:43,699
organization for security analysts

794
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:46,160
that aren't that well versed in AWS.

795
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,170
And a key part to make that happen

796
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,630
is the service

797
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,400
that we delivered in November 19th,

798
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:54,880
which is AWS IAM

799
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:58,868
temporary delegated permissions

800
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,269
managed by partners.

801
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,118
And what this does is when you click

802
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,279
that button and you provide your AWS account

803
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,368
number for your management account,

804
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,219
that will actually, uh, send a message

805
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:11,098
to the

806
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,598
delegated administrator for

807
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,838
the AWS management account

808
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,259
requesting permission

809
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,180
to add a read-only role

810
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:21,828
so that the Falcon platform can

811
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,598
understand where is Cloudtrail deployed.

812
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,170
If I have guard duty or security hub

813
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,689
deployed,

814
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:29,328
what AWS account is that deployed in?

815
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,670
Which regions is it deployed in?

816
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,969
Have I consolidated to a single region

817
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:35,848
for a security hub so I have a home region?

818
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,170
All of these questions would normally

819
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,368
take 3 to 6 months of

820
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:41,640
your security team

821
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,049
talking to your cloud ops team to create

822
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:44,709
a plan

823
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,489
in order to do this deployment.

824
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,890
And so trying to remove that friction

825
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,890
is what we really wanted to make happen

826
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:54,289
when we provided this IM

827
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,368
delegated temporary permission. Now this

828
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,729
doesn't mean you're giving CrowdStrike the permission

829
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,430
to add roles whenever they like.

830
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:01,269
It's only

831
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:04,130
a permission for the next, when the administrator

832
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,539
approves it for 120

833
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,469
seconds for them to actually initiate

834
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,529
the request that then comes back and

835
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:13,568
actually triggers the cloud formation

836
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,568
template stack sets to actually get

837
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:16,750
deployed into your account.

838
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,989
And what that does is it really makes sure you have the visibility

839
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:21,930
to understand what was deployed,

840
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,709
and they can actually look at that.

841
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,209
But then if ever you want to look

842
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:28,289
back in time, it's in that account where it was

843
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,289
deployed, what was deployed, and how

844
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,170
it was deployed.

845
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,578
And this is the demo.

846
00:30:38,348 --> 00:30:38,880
Yes.

847
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,430
So in this example is

848
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,779
inside of the NextGenim when you first log on,

849
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,930
and you see that on here,

850
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,049
these are the number of detections.

851
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,459
And when you actually first log into

852
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,358
Falcon Xion, I mean you've deployed.

853
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:55,380
And you're a new customer,

854
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,219
um, it will actually have a link that tells you more

855
00:30:58,598 --> 00:30:59,858
about the documentation,

856
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,000
just logging in.

857
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,368
And this is the next GEM onboarding guide

858
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:06,568
that tells you detail. All of this would be

859
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:08,809
available inside of the Falcon

860
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:09,430
console.

861
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,380
Actually explains

862
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,779
in detail with all the documentation

863
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,140
and videos to follow along

864
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,598
so that you can understand how to do detection and

865
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:20,739
response triage, set up workflows,

866
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:22,519
um, set up automation.

867
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,500
Um, and then there are a number of additional quick

868
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
start guides, which are also more

869
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,019
about the different Falcon cloud, um, Falcon modules

870
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:31,920
that you can use.

871
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:34,618
But in this example here, what I'm going to go

872
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:36,199
over to is.

873
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,529
Going to the data connections

874
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:40,108
page.

875
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,170
Getting there. As you can see there are a lot of components

876
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,689
to the next gen SEM.

877
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,890
And here you can see the actual

878
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,078
um. Quick start

879
00:31:59,078 --> 00:31:59,680
tab.

880
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,848
Sorting it by.

881
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,618
Cloud trail,

882
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,368
and you can see this cloud trail and guard duty

883
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,439
itself. Clicking

884
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,358
on the Quick Start

885
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,838
on here, you can see that it's already connected to

886
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:27,880
one active cloud trail and it shows another

887
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,799
one disactive,

888
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,559
as well as all of the active, uh, guard

889
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,598
duty and security hub connectors that

890
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:35,140
are automatically deployed.

891
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,779
At any point in time, you can disable,

892
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,920
um, a, uh,

893
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,598
one of the data connectors and it's immediately disabled.

894
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,150
No further data is coming in,

895
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,719
uh, to NextGen SIM.

896
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,660
But then when I want to turn on,

897
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:51,039
say, uh, an inactive service after,

898
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,500
um, asset discovery,

899
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,979
it actually issues a temporary

900
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:55,799
permission request.

901
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:58,900
And when you click on it, it actually

902
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,098
sends a redirect link. This is what the

903
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:03,199
administrator would see inside of

904
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,750
the IAM console.

905
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,500
You can see someone has issued a temporary delegation

906
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,078
request,

907
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,618
and when they actually click that, it'll actually show

908
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:13,818
them what permissions they're

909
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:14,519
requesting

910
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,358
and what's the temporary permission

911
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,739
that they're requesting that's only going to be for

912
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,108
the 120

913
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:21,920
minutes that it was enabled.

914
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,489
So that they can actually create the role, what role they

915
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,529
were creating it in, what account it was creating

916
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:28,750
in, as well as the permission boundary

917
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:31,209
so it doesn't allow runaway access. Now each

918
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,009
of these,

919
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,029
um, temporary permission requests

920
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:37,640
have been submitted by, um, ISV

921
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,170
vendors in advance for.

922
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:41,723
Security review by AWS with

923
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:43,384
the appropriate permission boundaries.

924
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:46,084
So from that perspective, we're checking

925
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:48,364
to make sure that these permission requests,

926
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:51,344
um, do not, are not overly permissive.

927
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:54,324
So you're not necessarily giving ISV vendors

928
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,005
access that is inappropriate.

929
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,469
Then once that permission request has been,

930
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,568
um, approved, it'll actually

931
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:03,969
show that it's deployed. These are the number of different

932
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,049
states that that status can show so you

933
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,009
can understand if

934
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:09,449
the admin rejected

935
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,489
that request. You can also understand if

936
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,648
it timed out so you can reissue it. And

937
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:15,708
then once it's active, you'll actually show

938
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:18,728
on that page at the bottom the active

939
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,929
going from deployed to active state

940
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,889
again. So

941
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,929
for new customers, uh, that do not

942
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,228
use the Falcon console,

943
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,809
we have a number of ways you can find that. Number

944
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,659
one is through the AWS marketplace,

945
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,099
but also inside of AWS

946
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,289
security hub in the management

947
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:38,030
section,

948
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,688
uh, there is an integrations

949
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:43,050
tab, and within that there is a tile

950
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,530
for, um, the Falcon NextGen

951
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,739
SIM for AWS.

952
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,369
Inside of Marketplace,

953
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:51,628
um, it will, when you click on that, we'll send you

954
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,958
to the same page with AWS Marketplace

955
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:55,648
for which you can then deploy.

956
00:34:56,188 --> 00:34:58,188
Now this is the demo of that end to

957
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,559
end. So say you're an AWS

958
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,628
security hub and you go to that management

959
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:03,349
section.

960
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:05,820
Inside of that management section you could type

961
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,989
CrowdStrike or Falcon.

962
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,789
You can click purchase or configure.

963
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,648
And that will actually take you to

964
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:13,958
the marketplace page.

965
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,159
You can click,

966
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:17,648
uh, and, and review that page,

967
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,648
click View purchase options.

968
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,869
And once you click the view purchase options, you'll

969
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:25,010
actually see the metrics you'll be charged for

970
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:25,668
for consumption.

971
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,059
There you can see it's um per gigabyte

972
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:33,550
for ingestion and then there's

973
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,458
also some cloud workload um.

974
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,378
Protection that Rob will go into further.

975
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:41,739
Uh, once you accept that and subscribe,

976
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,500
um, and you click on set up my account,

977
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,619
this is the page of what will actually begin

978
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,679
the verifying the permissions that you would need to

979
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,860
deploy this in the marketplace,

980
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:52,938
uh, for

981
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,559
initially, it would be deployed out of the

982
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,590
management account. I remind you that because it needs

983
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,059
to be the head of the organization.

984
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,429
And then, um, it'll actually pivot you

985
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:05,110
to the Falcon page to actually register,

986
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:08,030
uh, as a new customer. Once you provide your

987
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,708
information on this page,

988
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,309
um, it will actually submit that

989
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,280
to CrowdStrike,

990
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:15,708
um, and then when CrowdStrike, they'll

991
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,449
start to auto provision your SID

992
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:19,570
for you, your customer ID.

993
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,929
And then it will, uh, send you emails

994
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,978
telling you the status of that.

995
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,398
And so here's an example of the emails. First,

996
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,478
you're gonna get an email from the AW or your

997
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:31,820
billing contact. We'll get an

998
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,579
email from um

999
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,329
AWS Marketplace saying that you have subscribed.

1000
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,458
You'll then get a welcome email

1001
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:41,280
from CrowdStrike as a pay as you go

1002
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,519
customer, and then you'll get an activation

1003
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,300
link. Once you click on that activation

1004
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,090
link, um, you will go ahead and,

1005
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,760
um, provide a password,

1006
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:52,878
an MFA for your account,

1007
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:55,579
and then, um, it will log

1008
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:56,309
you in.

1009
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,360
Now, once you complete those portions

1010
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,099
and you refresh the bottom of the page, it'll

1011
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,030
actually, uh, take you to the autoconfigure

1012
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,889
component.

1013
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:08,360
Now, it's gonna default to the region you're

1014
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,500
in when you're deploying this. Now you can

1015
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,579
specify a different region you want it to run in.

1016
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,159
But by default, it's gonna detect the region that you're

1017
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,478
in. um, it's also gonna detect

1018
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:19,958
all of the cloud trails that you have configured, selecting

1019
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:22,148
your organization with management events.

1020
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,938
Now, the reason we want to provide this to CrowdStrike

1021
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:25,978
is because

1022
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,340
management events inside Cloud Trail

1023
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,938
is every API action

1024
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,050
that happens

1025
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:34,469
inside of AWS. So if I want to know when

1026
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,510
someone's provisioning something, if I want

1027
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,668
to know when someone's creating something new, when

1028
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:39,869
someone changes something,

1029
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:42,188
it's always going to get recorded in cloud trail

1030
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:42,769
first,

1031
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:45,228
um, coming across the event bus. And so

1032
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,228
getting that information as soon as I can

1033
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:47,929
over to my SEM

1034
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,789
so I can start analyzing that quickly is really

1035
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,929
important. And then if

1036
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,250
the customer has a guard duty

1037
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,219
or security hub enabled,

1038
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,708
that's set up so it deploys those via Amazon

1039
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,628
Event Bridge

1040
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:03,110
so that those events as they're

1041
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,010
occurring and being logged

1042
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,789
to the default event bus within AWS

1043
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:08,699
across your organization,

1044
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:11,510
that is going to be sent immediately put on the

1045
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,530
event bus for CrowdStrike,

1046
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,148
uh, SIM so that it picks that up and can

1047
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:17,239
respond in real time.

1048
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:20,099
Now once the integration is complete, this

1049
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,619
takes about 10 to 15 minutes.

1050
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,938
Um, you have a link where you can click on and

1051
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:27,139
it'll take you to the stack sets in cloud

1052
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,139
formation so you can see everything that was

1053
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:29,728
deployed,

1054
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,300
how it was deployed, and for here

1055
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,659
when it comes to guard duty and security

1056
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:35,199
hub,

1057
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,619
it's not that. Changing the configuration or

1058
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,699
modifying the configuration of any of

1059
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,820
those, but we're just determining which

1060
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,000
AWS account

1061
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:45,340
that that might be delegated to, as

1062
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,449
well as the region or regions it's

1063
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:49,659
deployed into so that we can deploy these

1064
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,849
event Amazon event bridge

1065
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:52,489
rules

1066
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,228
so that we can start sending those.

1067
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,989
And then once you go back, you can also,

1068
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:01,369
uh, click on the launch crotch strike.

1069
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:04,329
And that will take you to the login page to the data

1070
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:06,398
connections. And within data connections,

1071
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:08,228
once again, going here, you can see,

1072
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:10,869
um, the cloud trails that were

1073
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,929
enabled.

1074
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:14,619
As well as those that it might have discovered later,

1075
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:15,610
the same thing,

1076
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:18,099
uh, with guard duty and security hub.

1077
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,458
And with that, talking a little bit

1078
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,429
more about the pay as you go, it's Rob.

1079
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:25,250
Thank you. Thanks, Jen.

1080
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,010
Many, most of you are already

1081
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:33,809
CrowdStrike customers. Thank you very much,

1082
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:36,668
um, but there are folks

1083
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:39,179
here who are not CrowdStrike customers and,

1084
00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:39,750
um.

1085
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:42,869
You know, we, we wanted to make all

1086
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,329
of this easier

1087
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,878
for the AWS customers, for people who are

1088
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,360
just starting to onboard.

1089
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:51,570
Now everybody here who's an AWS

1090
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,070
customer, like why did you move

1091
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:55,809
to AWS in the first place? Why did you start building

1092
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,050
there? Why did you migrate?

1093
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,570
It's a lot of different reasons, but at the end of the

1094
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,570
day, AWS allows you

1095
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,030
to move more quickly,

1096
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,789
simplifies your operational burden,

1097
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:06,809
um.

1098
00:40:07,628 --> 00:40:09,800
You're able to render your infrastructure

1099
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,269
as code. You're able to

1100
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,760
scale out, scale in. You're

1101
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,458
able to launch in other regions.

1102
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,099
That ability to move quickly

1103
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,360
is a differentiator for for

1104
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,340
companies today.

1105
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:26,938
Now If you don't

1106
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:28,938
have security it's very,

1107
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:31,219
very difficult to get all of those benefits

1108
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:33,539
because your security team is gonna slow you down at every

1109
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:35,769
step. You're probably the securities team,

1110
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,119
security team, you know what I'm talking about.

1111
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:40,780
Um, if there is not that security

1112
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,820
in place, how do you know that these

1113
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,139
developers who are building infrastructure are

1114
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,208
actually applying security best

1115
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,340
practices and even if they

1116
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,958
are.

1117
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:52,000
Um, uh,

1118
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,590
you know, how do you know that those,

1119
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,139
um, those controls are being deployed,

1120
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,519
uh, at scale across your whole

1121
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:01,938
organization? Now when security

1122
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,239
is in place and it is able

1123
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,639
to automatically scale in

1124
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,699
response to

1125
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,938
um uh resource

1126
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,719
uh provisioning events.

1127
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:16,059
And you know that it is being uniformly

1128
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,898
uh deployed across your environment.

1129
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,668
In those situations, security is a

1130
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,719
catalyst then you're able to move faster,

1131
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:24,929
able to grow faster, able to

1132
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,329
get all of the benefits of

1133
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,599
what you have done in AWS.

1134
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:32,938
So we wanted to make the, the, the,

1135
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,179
the Falcon platform and we, we've

1136
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:37,458
been partnering with AWS for years

1137
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,619
and we have over 110

1138
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:40,500
integrations.

1139
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,530
So we've been, we've been building hard

1140
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,849
and fast to make it really, uh,

1141
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,228
valuable for AWS customers.

1142
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,978
So we realized we like in order

1143
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,159
to reach customers who are not

1144
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,300
ready to sign an annual contract.

1145
00:41:58,128 --> 00:42:00,159
In order to match the, the,

1146
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,168
the universal common

1147
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:04,250
procurement method at AWS, which

1148
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,329
is to say consumption billing or pay

1149
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,139
as you go,

1150
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:10,010
we realized how important it was to offer

1151
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,010
that to, uh, to AWS

1152
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,628
customers now at launch.

1153
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:16,188
Our pay as you go offering

1154
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:18,648
is intended for new customers.

1155
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,648
If you were already an AWS customer

1156
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,389
and, and you wanna try out any of these new

1157
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:24,860
capabilities, then,

1158
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:27,199
you know, we, we recommend talking to your,

1159
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:28,280
to your sales rep.

1160
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,728
If you're a new customer, you can get

1161
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:33,309
started in minutes with no

1162
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:34,510
spend commitments.

1163
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,789
You are charged literally.

1164
00:42:37,128 --> 00:42:39,369
Um, as Jen said before,

1165
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,530
uh, per gigabyte ingested

1166
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,289
for NGSIM,

1167
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,708
and when we say per gigabyte ingested,

1168
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,309
that is a flat fee. It's not,

1169
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:48,269
OK,

1170
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,728
it's, uh, it's a gig here, and then

1171
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:52,958
there's some additional costs, you know, for retention,

1172
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:55,489
additional costs for all of your queries

1173
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,849
and dashboards. No, it's a, a single

1174
00:42:57,849 --> 00:42:58,849
flat fee

1175
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,289
for your, your data ingestion.

1176
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,898
And when we talk about how easy we

1177
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:06,300
made it to ingest AWS data,

1178
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,260
um, the simplification wizards.

1179
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:11,360
You can ingest any data that NGSI

1180
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,719
supports. And we have,

1181
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,000
um, I think approximately 200,

1182
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,500
um, data connectors built for a

1183
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,119
wide range of data sources.

1184
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:23,760
So we have per gig pricing

1185
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,860
for NGSIM and it always includes 13

1186
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,619
month retention.

1187
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:30,010
We also include in the same listing,

1188
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,530
Falcon cloud security runtime. Now you've

1189
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,378
heard, you know about the Falcon sensor.

1190
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:36,969
Falcon cloud security run time is that,

1191
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:39,260
that sensor component that deploys

1192
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,289
in EC2 instances and container

1193
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:42,619
environments or Fargate.

1194
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:46,030
And it also includes container image

1195
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,969
assessment

1196
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:49,369
um at at every phase

1197
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,679
in the um in the software

1198
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,119
development life cycle so

1199
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:55,349
something that can run on the

1200
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,489
um uh on the on the

1201
00:43:57,789 --> 00:43:59,878
uh IDE of the developer station

1202
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:02,030
or in a CICD pipeline or even

1203
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,148
registry

1204
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,469
um red um ECR registration

1205
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:08,590
we can do it all in all of those places

1206
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,869
and then you can build policy off

1207
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:12,329
of the findings

1208
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,750
of that image assessment.

1209
00:44:15,228 --> 00:44:17,429
So the benefit of this for customers is

1210
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,489
again, instead of going through a multi-month

1211
00:44:19,628 --> 00:44:21,708
sales cycle, you can deploy in

1212
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:22,250
minutes.

1213
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:24,929
Jen was showing you the workflow

1214
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:25,489
through

1215
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,168
uh through Marketplace.

1216
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,860
Um, once

1217
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,429
customers submit that,

1218
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:33,139
that input form data,

1219
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,918
essentially we, we need your email address

1220
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:38,090
because that's how we allocate permissions.

1221
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
It, it, it takes the, the

1222
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,478
fastest we've seen and probably on average

1223
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:44,679
is about 10 to 15 minutes for all

1224
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,820
of the provisioning. So we wanna get you

1225
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,780
protecting your workloads as quickly as possible.

1226
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,539
Again, there are no spend commitments

1227
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,159
and we provide very transparent

1228
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:54,840
public pricing.

1229
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:59,429
Um, to allow you to align your spend

1230
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:00,219
with consumption.

1231
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,938
Now what is Falcon cloud security? Now,

1232
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,438
um, if you're familiar with this module,

1233
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,639
we sell it in different flavors. There's really

1234
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,679
the proactive component and there's

1235
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,878
the cloud runtime component. Cloud runtime

1236
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:12,898
component is really

1237
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:15,559
more reactive, so the sensors running

1238
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,019
on your workloads, watching all of

1239
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,300
the events that are happening in,

1240
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,599
in, in your, on your host in

1241
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:23,239
your system.

1242
00:45:23,728 --> 00:45:25,769
Um, we take all of that

1243
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:27,789
information and the sensors themselves

1244
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,050
are able to, uh, are

1245
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,050
able to process about 92%

1246
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,329
of everything that comes through there and

1247
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:36,639
make a positive determination about

1248
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,250
whether,

1249
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,349
um, uh, some,

1250
00:45:39,648 --> 00:45:41,969
uh, suspicious activity might be malicious

1251
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,103
and if it is. Malicious

1252
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:45,014
you can create your own

1253
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:47,554
uh prevention rules that will

1254
00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:48,773
that will stop

1255
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:51,235
the the attack in progress

1256
00:45:51,235 --> 00:45:52,894
without any additional effort

1257
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:55,394
even out of the box we're doing that, but you

1258
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:56,494
have the ability

1259
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,914
to really tighten those rules based

1260
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:01,215
upon your particular workload and environment.

1261
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,820
Um,

1262
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,679
on the proactive side

1263
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:08,699
we're, we're collecting information

1264
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,898
about your, you know, CSPM,

1265
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:12,918
basically your cloud security posture management.

1266
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,579
And uh and that entails

1267
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,119
pulling in cloud trail

1268
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:18,860
through um

1269
00:46:19,228 --> 00:46:21,378
through Event bridge so in near real time

1270
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:21,918
we can

1271
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,119
see if

1272
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,688
there are any indicators of an active attack

1273
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:27,780
and we could look at your your your

1274
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,820
configuration of your AWS services

1275
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,139
and make sure that they are configured

1276
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,739
according to security best practices. Proactive

1277
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:36,739
security includes a lot more than that, including

1278
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:39,239
data security posture management, AI

1279
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,360
security posture management, and so on.

1280
00:46:41,978 --> 00:46:43,119
So in this release.

1281
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:44,878
Cloud security,

1282
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:46,800
uh, runtime protection

1283
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,280
that you see on the right

1284
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,800
in future release will be including

1285
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,019
proactive security, but just to give you an idea

1286
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,500
about what Falcon cloud security actually

1287
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,219
is. Um,

1288
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,500
We, we have a lot of studies since

1289
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,829
we've been releasing this. We talked to customers

1290
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:06,978
about, um, uh,

1291
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,780
the actual outcomes that they've experienced.

1292
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,800
Um, we have a team,

1293
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,860
uh, that does business value assessments

1294
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,179
so that we can provide some metrics

1295
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:18,628
around the improvements that, um,

1296
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
that companies of

1297
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,820
similar sizes are able to see so you

1298
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,898
can see things like a 98%

1299
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:26,898
reduction in critical vulnerabilities on the

1300
00:47:26,898 --> 00:47:27,719
proactive side.

1301
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:30,418
Um, on the, on the, on the

1302
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,820
runtime side, 89%

1303
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,800
faster cloud detection and response.

1304
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,458
And when you think about a number

1305
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,500
like that in the context of

1306
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,780
how fast these attacks proceed,

1307
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,898
as Minoj mentioned before, on

1308
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:45,340
average 48 minutes.

1309
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:46,695
From initial

1310
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:49,793
access in, in, uh,

1311
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:52,375
before the attacker moves laterally,

1312
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,074
51 seconds before the attacker

1313
00:47:55,074 --> 00:47:57,175
can move laterally is the fastest

1314
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,273
that we've seen before. It's imperative

1315
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:02,614
that, uh, teams are able to move quickly

1316
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,594
and we do that again through that automated

1317
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,773
capability that the sensor is able

1318
00:48:07,773 --> 00:48:09,054
to do all by itself.

1319
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,599
Um, and we're able to do it through,

1320
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,409
um,

1321
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:15,059
the implementation of agentic workflows

1322
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:15,679
and,

1323
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:18,239
um, in capabilities

1324
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,329
that we provide again that

1325
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,559
allow you to accelerate

1326
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,139
these, um.

1327
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,510
These investigations.

1328
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:31,269
Um, so just to summarize,

1329
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:33,769
um, Falcon Cloud security runtime

1330
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:36,050
protection, what are the capabilities that we're offering?

1331
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,599
Thread intel and thread hunting is

1332
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:40,889
really, uh, underpins everything we

1333
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:43,199
do across the whole platform. So

1334
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,148
we're tracking adversary activity.

1335
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,750
We track over 250

1336
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:49,889
adversaries, so we understand

1337
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,688
exactly the, the, the

1338
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:54,820
industry. Or organizations that

1339
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,978
they typically target as well

1340
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:59,039
as their very specific

1341
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,539
um uh tools tactics and

1342
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,519
practices so that we can anticipate

1343
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:07,019
what they're likely to do and when we

1344
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,369
start to see a series of behaviors

1345
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,539
we can figure out what they're probably gonna

1346
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:13,739
do next so that we can identify and anticipate

1347
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:14,639
and block

1348
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,949
um uh those kinds of attacks.

1349
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:19,958
Cloud workload protection again that's

1350
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,849
the, the sensors deployed on the workloads

1351
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,019
themselves that not only can take that

1352
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:26,398
independent action but take

1353
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:28,739
um uh that that that

1354
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,780
are also taking events and sending them up

1355
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,719
to the cloud for further analysis

1356
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,909
anything that's going on that we don't

1357
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,489
understand, we're not sure if it's an attack we haven't

1358
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:39,159
seen it, we don't know that it's positive.

1359
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:41,800
Um, you know, OK or neutral, we'll

1360
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,530
send that up to the cloud and in milliseconds

1361
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,349
we can return a response

1362
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:48,809
so that, um, that your sensor can

1363
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:49,889
take appropriate action.

1364
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,648
Um, cloud detection response,

1365
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:55,958
um, is a, a new and developing

1366
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,030
capability. This was one of our

1367
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:58,898
announcements.

1368
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:01,300
Um, cloud detection response is that we're able

1369
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,719
to take all of the telemetry

1370
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,519
across the entire cloud estate

1371
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,739
and we can determine

1372
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:10,360
through that overall context and

1373
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,500
through. Um, uh, subtle

1374
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,619
signals whether there's an actual attack

1375
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,699
in progress and what we just uh

1376
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,820
what we just announced in the last few

1377
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,438
days that we're gonna be pulling into.

1378
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:23,809
Um, the, it, it, it

1379
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,918
will be part of pay as you go,

1380
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,860
you know, within the next couple of months

1381
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,208
is real-time cloud detection and

1382
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,478
response where we're able to take that cloud

1383
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:33,909
trail stream

1384
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,409
and correlate it with other signals

1385
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,869
we may have to say,

1386
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,208
you know, it's not just that we see

1387
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,208
this particular one thing happening

1388
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,128
in cloud trail.

1389
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,289
It's that we see a chain of behaviors

1390
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:48,389
that of in and of themselves

1391
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:50,929
are indicative of an attack and um

1392
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:53,090
Curly Spider I think was a really good example

1393
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,148
of of uh of of the kind

1394
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:57,550
of signals where we would take all

1395
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,688
all that cloud information and show you

1396
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:01,869
that there's an attack in progress and then

1397
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,398
automate a response that you can

1398
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:05,469
set up the automation

1399
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:06,728
uh in advance.

1400
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,320
Um, and again, Falcon Overwatch and Complete.

1401
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,148
Um, you move to the cloud, maybe you've

1402
00:51:13,148 --> 00:51:14,168
just done a migration,

1403
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:16,780
maybe your security team is,

1404
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:18,909
uh, a little bit stretched or just getting up

1405
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,309
to speed with the cloud,

1406
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,188
um, you can accelerate your migration,

1407
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,769
um, or if you have a small team

1408
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:26,869
that you don't wanna,

1409
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:28,429
um, you know, try to.

1410
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:31,260
Um, staff a team for,

1411
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,949
uh, 24/7 365

1412
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:36,119
operations. We provide a

1413
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,280
portfolio of managed services

1414
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,559
including managed detection and response. That's

1415
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,579
Falcon Complete,

1416
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,300
managed thread hunting, that's Falcon Overwatch.

1417
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,628
If you purchase complete Overwatch is included,

1418
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,860
but you can purchase Overwatch separately.

1419
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,659
Why is Overwatch important?

1420
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,860
Right? There's a lot of data here.

1421
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,860
NGSIM next gen SEM

1422
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,438
is a place to correlate that data. We

1423
00:51:58,438 --> 00:51:59,668
provide those rules,

1424
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:02,148
um, we provide the correlation rules,

1425
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,938
we provide the automation,

1426
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,289
but if you want us to manage that,

1427
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:08,478
we can do that for you. If you want us to do

1428
00:52:08,478 --> 00:52:10,599
the, the, the, the threat hunting

1429
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,800
correlating all the signals, we can do that

1430
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,889
for you. Um,

1431
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:19,489
at launch, uh, we have,

1432
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:20,199
um,

1433
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:22,619
as Jen described, we

1434
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:25,659
have created data on boarding simplification.

1435
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:28,099
The data on boarding process can really slow

1436
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:30,300
companies down, so we wanted to make that

1437
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,280
easy so you can start getting value

1438
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,958
as quickly as possible.

1439
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:37,099
Now in a later phase of our pay as

1440
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:39,478
you go, uh, strategy and roadmap,

1441
00:52:39,938 --> 00:52:42,099
we are planning to add that

1442
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,500
level of automation,

1443
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,570
um, so post pay go purchase, you'll be able to roll right

1444
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,079
into

1445
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,820
multi-account or wide sensor deployment.

1446
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,668
Um, now this is that that

1447
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:56,168
capability is not in

1448
00:52:56,168 --> 00:52:57,559
marketplace today,

1449
00:52:58,188 --> 00:52:59,590
but what we,

1450
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,050
what we announced

1451
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,550
2 2+ years

1452
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,458
back is a partnership with AWS

1453
00:53:07,668 --> 00:53:09,849
where we built, um, a

1454
00:53:10,168 --> 00:53:12,000
set of cloud formation templates,

1455
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:14,030
um, called AWS Built in.

1456
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:16,809
That enables that multi-account

1457
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:18,849
organization-wide deployment of sensors using

1458
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,239
uh SSM Systems Manager.

1459
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:23,429
Uh, we have a published uh distributor

1460
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:25,688
package you can create those automations,

1461
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,269
um, uh, deployment on

1462
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,648
EKS and other container environments,

1463
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,469
um, uh, multi-account

1464
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:36,019
ECR registration, multi-region multi-count

1465
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:37,269
ECR registration.

1466
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:39,898
Um, all of these exist and

1467
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:41,949
the documentation that Jen was showing before,

1468
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,789
uh, also includes, um, how

1469
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,030
to use these features

1470
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:49,409
and one of the things that I'll say is this

1471
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:50,590
is continuous protection.

1472
00:53:52,728 --> 00:53:53,329
Um,

1473
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:55,938
if when you deploy these, um, these

1474
00:53:55,938 --> 00:53:57,938
templates in cloud formation, we also

1475
00:53:57,938 --> 00:53:59,079
have them in terraform,

1476
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,579
uh, they not only protect the

1477
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:03,478
resources that you already have deployed.

1478
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:06,199
But they also, um,

1479
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:08,599
they also deploy lambda functions and so on

1480
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:10,878
and, and, uh, event bridge rules that

1481
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:11,579
will detect

1482
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:13,739
when you provision new

1483
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:16,320
AWS resources and then will

1484
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,519
automatically protect those resources.

1485
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,619
So going back to what I said before,

1486
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,039
just protecting your resources in that

1487
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:25,188
single point of time is not enough. You

1488
00:54:25,188 --> 00:54:27,239
need to know that it is continuous

1489
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:27,800
deployment.

1490
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:29,449
Um, based upon

1491
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:31,909
when you are deploying your resources

1492
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:33,809
and of course if you scale them back

1493
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:36,389
then you are no longer charged for

1494
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:38,489
those sensors, only when only those

1495
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:40,570
running sensors. So to look briefly

1496
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,909
at what we have here, um, the first one

1497
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:45,530
is, uh, account registration

1498
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:47,869
that's something that's gonna come more into

1499
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:50,309
play when we release the proactive component.

1500
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,099
This already exists in our console.

1501
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:56,449
Um, the rest of them are runtime

1502
00:54:56,449 --> 00:54:58,530
Falcon Cloud security runtime features, so,

1503
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,789
um, EC2 instance protection,

1504
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:02,708
um, you know, again

1505
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,219
with, uh, systems manager. Systems

1506
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,329
Manager itself will see when a

1507
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:07,909
new,

1508
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,289
uh, when a new EC2 instance,

1509
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:10,949
um,

1510
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,728
uh, goes online and will automatically deploy

1511
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,010
the sensor at that time again cross region

1512
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:16,708
cross account.

1513
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,168
Um, container registry assessments if

1514
00:55:20,168 --> 00:55:22,610
you want to do that container assessment,

1515
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:24,809
we recommend that you do. It's a very powerful

1516
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:27,449
tool. Um, you can register

1517
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,789
all of your ECR, uh,

1518
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:31,889
uh, repositories across all of your

1519
00:55:31,889 --> 00:55:33,590
accounts inside of an organization,

1520
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:36,168
uh, again in, in just a single

1521
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,128
template deployment.

1522
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,750
And then finally we have a Falcon operator,

1523
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,769
um, uh, deployment methodology

1524
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:46,369
that will enable you to deploy

1525
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:48,519
the operator once in an in

1526
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,570
an EKS cluster and it will deploy

1527
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,570
the Falcon sensor and we have

1528
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,860
a Falcon Kubernetes admission controller

1529
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,250
that allows you to create admission

1530
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,228
policies

1531
00:55:58,648 --> 00:56:01,070
for those container images

1532
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:03,688
that um that we have done the assessment

1533
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:04,969
on. Um,

1534
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,780
in that assessment we're looking for different vulnerabilities

1535
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,780
or misconfigurations, and you can set

1536
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,820
your own threshold determine whether you wanna

1537
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,000
just prevent those or

1538
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:15,898
to alert on them and so on.

1539
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,340
And for those of you who are building your own

1540
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,719
um uh generative or agentic

1541
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,139
AI capabilities,

1542
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:24,059
um,

1543
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:25,179
um,

1544
00:56:25,918 --> 00:56:28,398
so many of the tools used in,

1545
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:30,599
in, in building these applications

1546
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:31,539
and models.

1547
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:33,958
Um, training models and so on

1548
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:36,239
are, are containerized, and

1549
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,239
many people pull those containers off of

1550
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:39,239
public repositories.

1551
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,099
This is one of the, the primary,

1552
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,539
uh, sources of,

1553
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,079
uh, of malicious software,

1554
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:49,579
um, malicious tampering that we see

1555
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,978
in these, uh, in, you know, as a,

1556
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,199
as a, as a large AI security

1557
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:56,139
threat, so, um.

1558
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:59,438
Sending all of those images

1559
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,610
through that kind of container, uh, image

1560
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:03,800
assessment and then being able to set policy

1561
00:57:03,978 --> 00:57:06,019
is gonna be uh a critical part of

1562
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:08,179
your, your integrated your integrated

1563
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,599
AI strategy as well.

1564
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:12,188
Um

1565
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,179
If you'd like to get started, if you're

1566
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:17,418
not already a CrowdStrike customer,

1567
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,179
um,

1568
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,719
uh, we have a QR code here on the left.

1569
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:22,760
Again, you can get started in minutes.

1570
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,599
Um, like I said before,

1571
00:57:24,898 --> 00:57:26,898
that single listing includes both Falcon Cloud

1572
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:29,050
Security and NGSIM. You could use any mix of

1573
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,208
those products that's relevant to you.

1574
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Like Minoj mentioned before, if

1575
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,559
you use Falcon Cloud Security with NGSIM,

1576
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,938
the storage of that Falcon Cloud security

1577
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:39,958
data is all free storage.

1578
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:43,719
Um, you can learn more about, um,

1579
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:44,599
uh.

1580
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,369
CrowdStrike Falcon for AWS. I'm not sure how

1581
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:49,110
that's different, but then the other one,

1582
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,898
CrowdStrike Falcon NexG SIM for AWS

1583
00:57:51,898 --> 00:57:54,239
through AWS Marketplace. Are these all the same?

1584
00:57:54,489 --> 00:57:55,050
No, they're not.

1585
00:57:55,688 --> 00:57:57,769
OK. The first is a site where

1586
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:58,860
they can learn about AWS and,

1587
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:02,329
uh, Falcon integrations. OK.

1588
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:05,208
And then the other is a blog on,

1589
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:07,570
um, how to deploy Cross Strike Falcon

1590
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,398
NextG SIM step by step.

1591
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,619
Thank you for spelling that out.

1592
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,329
Um, thank you very much. We're, we're.
