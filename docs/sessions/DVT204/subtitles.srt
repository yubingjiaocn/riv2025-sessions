1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
- Okay.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,750
Hey and welcome to our talk.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,750
What's new in AWS
full-stack app development.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,570
My name is Mark and with me
is my co-presenter, Salih.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,354
We are both based out of Berlin

6
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:18,270
and we have a background
in full-stack development

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,103
and that's probably

8
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,624
what brought us here to
have that talk with you.

9
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:23,010
(attendees chattering)

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,170
- So, what you will see today

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,390
is that I'm talking about what's new

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,800
in full-stack development obviously,

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,650
because that's the thing in its talk.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,430
And obviously, one of the biggest changes

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,600
that happened in the last few years

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,800
is how generative AI is being
used during development.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,092
And full-stack development
is not any different.

18
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:50,092
And because we don't want
to make this a sales show

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,393
and telling you that GenAI is
solving all of your problems,

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,950
we will go and have a
honest checkpoint with you.

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,650
So, where the gaps are, what GenAI can do,

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,440
where it doesn't do well,
and what we can do about it.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,932
And to make the things real,

24
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,008
we will have a live demo with Salih.

25
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:12,060
So, he is as brave as
it can be and he will go

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,676
and is coding live for
you in app on the stage.

27
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,926
(attendees chattering)

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,853
- So, let me see. Whoop.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,860
Let me see
(Salih chuckles)

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,300
who we have here today.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,360
So, who of you would identify
as a full-stack developer?

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,441
Please raise your hands.

33
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,340
(attendees chattering)

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,140
- Okay. That's pretty much majority.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,250
Nice, nice.

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,290
I think you found the right talk.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,710
And how many of you are
using GenAI tools day-to-day

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,061
to do software development?

39
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,080
(attendees chattering)

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
- Okay, that's a bit less.

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
Maybe we can change that a little bit.

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,682
And then, now, tell me who
of you use generative AI

43
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:55,180
and checking it in right away to prod

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,623
without checking it twice or triple?

45
00:01:57,623 --> 00:01:58,950
(attendees chattering)

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,990
- Okay, that's what I thought.

47
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,753
Nobody is doing that and
I'm very happy about that.

48
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:08,130
So, what's a full-stack developer?

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,237
For me, a full-stack developer
is handing the entire stack,

50
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:15,104
frontend, backend, databases.

51
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,880
And obviously, most of you will be able

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,120
to just code an idea up into prod

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,830
and actually have it right away.

54
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,545
So, who of you are full-stack developers

55
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,110
because the team is small

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,890
or there maybe solo
running their own startup?

57
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,750
Who of you is actually
a full-stack developer

58
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,375
because the circumstances are like that?

59
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,800
(attendees chattering)

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,220
- Yes. Okay.

61
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,330
And for me, full-stack development

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,580
has something beauty in it.

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,350
It is a very pragmatic approach.

64
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,900
It's about velocity and ownership.

65
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,960
So, because you are usually alone

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,580
on building your application

67
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,209
and you can actually build everything

68
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,780
from the backend to the frontend,

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,852
you have an idea, you can
bring it all the way through,

70
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:04,170
this is what is the
prototype of an entrepreneur.

71
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,170
So, a single person with a great idea

72
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,100
and a great mind and great
skills can build it all.

73
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,479
But while you have all of this control,

74
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,670
it also comes at a certain cost.

75
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,910
So, you need to deal
with a lot of complexity.

76
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,080
So, most of the things

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,980
that you're dealing with and juggling,

78
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:28,530
those things are a mental burden.

79
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,370
You have to deal

80
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,600
with all the different things
that might break in a night.

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,180
You have to deal with
security vulnerabilities

82
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,130
that you need to keep track of.

83
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,230
Oh, this stack now has a new update

84
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,150
and there's new vulnerability found.

85
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,780
And is my app really
working all the way through?

86
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,119
And all of a sudden, you are on TV

87
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:52,320
or I don't know, some social media outlet,

88
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,180
and does it scale?

89
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,840
And all of that, you have to deal with

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,830
but it's not something that
you will enjoy all the time.

91
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,360
And in the last year, the nature
of that complexity shifted.

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,730
It's not that GenAI source all of that.

93
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,100
It's more that the complexity shifted

94
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,904
into a different style of
dealing with the complexity.

95
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:15,450
(attendees chattering)

96
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,397
- So, what do you need as
a full-stack developer?

97
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:21,120
(attendees chattering)

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,640
- So, you have to deal with hosting.

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,341
So, you have to deal with
the content delivery network,

100
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,770
with your DNS records,

101
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,158
you have Infrastructure as Code hopefully,

102
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:33,013
because you're not doing ClickOps.

103
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:36,030
You have to deal with your
API gateway configuration,

104
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,350
your compute, your database,

105
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,230
your storage, your
authentication, all of it.

106
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,530
And not only that but
you also have a pager

107
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,410
because between all of
those integration points

108
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,830
that you have to deal with,
there might also be a little bit

109
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,540
of business logic that
you need to implement

110
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,700
to actually make that app real.

111
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,200
And at least in my time
as a full-stack developer,

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,240
things usually break at
3:00 AM in the morning

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
when you really don't expect that

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,120
or on a Sunday afternoon

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,340
when you're out there with your kids.

116
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,082
So, dealing with all of those things

117
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,570
(attendees chattering)

118
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,730
- is a lot on your plate.

119
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,892
And GenAI, in the last two years,

120
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,080
actually gave you a boost, right?

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,490
So, you're much more productive,

122
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,726
you get a lot more things done,

123
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:21,480
but faster is not always better.

124
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,370
So, how I see GenAI,

125
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,670
and I don't know if this is my fault,

126
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,530
at least it comes to mind,

127
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,380
for me, GenAI is the
fastest keyboard on earth.

128
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,180
But it's not really more than that.

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,140
There's still someone

130
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,020
that needs to know what
you want to achieve.

131
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,030
GenAI usually does not have an intent.

132
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,310
It does not have an objective to reach.

133
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,300
It is something that
brings you fast forward

134
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,570
and it creates very
confidently a lot of code.

135
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,850
And most of the time, the code is correct,

136
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,142
but do you know if it is
having the best practices?

137
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:58,142
Does it give you secure components?

138
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:02,327
So, you have this fast pace
now that you need to deal with

139
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:06,400
and fast also means a lot more complexity

140
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,021
in understanding that.

141
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:10,517
(attendees chattering)

142
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:14,661
- And if you remember
in the last 20 years,

143
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,782
when we had to deal with
complex integration projects,

144
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,468
there were frameworks
that helped us through it

145
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:22,662
and that's not any different today.

146
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:25,380
So, if you think about Amplify,

147
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,608
which is a full-stack
application framework from AWS,

148
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:32,463
it has comprehensive service covering,

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,520
it has global hosting,

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,893
TypeScript for full-stack development,

151
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,380
and it gives you CI/CD pipelines,
it gives you a sandbox,

152
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,540
it gives you UI building components,

153
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,823
and all of them fit very well together.

154
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:54,165
And it lets you use CDK to
define your infrastructure

155
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,980
and expand that infrastructure
with escape hatches

156
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,670
where Amplify doesn't have a
component for you right away.

157
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,420
And what's new is we also put some effort

158
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,480
into making it easier for Kiro, Cursor,

159
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,074
or your preferred AI
tool to actually use it.

160
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:16,680
(attendees chattering)

161
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,930
- So, the cool thing about Amplify

162
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,930
is it's outside for seven years or so

163
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,830
and it is used globally in
hundreds of thousands of apps.

164
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,320
So, all the components that
are defined in Amplify,

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,600
they actually work, they're battle-tested.

166
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,500
We have fixed all the bugs
and we keep it current.

167
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,977
And now, if you use GenAI,

168
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,750
the problem that most of us have seen

169
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,480
is if you ask it to create you a database,

170
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,500
it goes with Python code and Bota3

171
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,690
and gives you all the SDK codes required

172
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,561
to actually set up your database.

173
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,394
(attendees chattering)

174
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:53,610
- And that might not be what you want.

175
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,890
And it might also not
give you guidance on,

176
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,550
if you want to use Aurora
database or DynamoDB.

177
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,020
Obviously, I always want a Dynamo,

178
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,690
but that might not be the right thing

179
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,580
for your specific use case.

180
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,110
And to get your specific use
case there is not so easy.

181
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,540
It is a lot of prompting
that is happening.

182
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,020
So, Amplify is helping you

183
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,310
with giving you predefined
constructs that you can base on

184
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,690
and that helps the AI

185
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,480
to actually limit the
scope of possibilities,

186
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,980
which then also gives you

187
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,113
a lot less code that you have to review.

188
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,530
So, Amplify, as I said,

189
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,690
is already out there for a long time.

190
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,690
And just alone this year, we
have built 31 major features

191
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,450
and that was like basically
multiple deployments

192
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,030
of new things every month.

193
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,030
So, to just pick out a few CDK,

194
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,660
we integrated all across Amplify.

195
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,940
And one thing that we integrated this year

196
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,050
was the CDK toolkit
library, which allows you

197
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,843
to programmatically
using CDK under the hood.

198
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,057
And what it gives you is
full abstractions of L2

199
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:10,350
and L3 constructs that you can use,

200
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,360
and CDK promises

201
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,000
to have the AWS best practices built-in

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
so that you can rely on that

203
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,683
to be the right thing
that you want to use.

204
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,590
So, the other thing

205
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,030
that we built quite heavily
on was storage browser.

206
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,190
So, all the pink ones here.

207
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,190
Storage browser is basically a
micro site that you can embed

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,670
and it helps you to host or
to manage your files on S3.

209
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,380
It gives you permissions,

210
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,720
it gives you download capabilities

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,795
with multi-file downloads,

212
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:48,510
thumbnails, custom
validation for file uploads.

213
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,020
You can share them privately
or with a certain group.

214
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,910
So, you have really enterprise control

215
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,896
over what's needed in your file storage.

216
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:58,950
(attendees chattering)

217
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,420
- And the cool thing about that

218
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,500
is you don't have to build that
with custom code and GenAI.

219
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,440
You can just drop in that one

220
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,810
and you know that you
have all the capabilities

221
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,773
that you require.

222
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,460
But we wouldn't be AWS

223
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,940
if security would not be our prime focus.

224
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,500
And that's the one that also

225
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,090
is scaring most people off
when it comes to GenAI.

226
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,190
Am I really sure that all the codes

227
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,090
is being generated is secure?

228
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,520
(attendees chattering)

229
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,703
- I have some hard time sometime
to review all of the codes

230
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:35,910
that is being reviewed,
that's being generated.

231
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,280
So, if you can see there's a drumbeat

232
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,960
of security-related features

233
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,033
that we built into Amplify is here.

234
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,693
There was web application
firewall integration,

235
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,540
there's Passkey support,

236
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,920
which helps it to log in as a customer.

237
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,420
And one thing that probably

238
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,020
is a very tedious task is
refresh token rotation.

239
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,980
So, if any one of you ever had certificate

240
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,180
that ran out of time and
just broke in a moment,

241
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,730
it's a lot of hassle to
actually get that back up.

242
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,220
And I have never seen

243
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,478
that there is a perfect
way to deal with that

244
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,700
and it's something that just
requires a lot of automation

245
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,030
and consciousness about
that to be the case.

246
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,000
We also released a email MFA.

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,930
If you're like me,

248
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,380
you don't like to give your
phone number to any website

249
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,380
just for logins, email MFA might
be a way to deal with that.

250
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,540
The last thing I would like to highlight

251
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,950
as something that, is Svelte support.

252
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,330
Svelte is not just yet
another JavaScript framework

253
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,750
that we integrated in Amplify,
it was done by the community.

254
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,130
So, Amplify is an open
source community project

255
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,370
and we are super happy

256
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,650
with our community contributing to it.

257
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,490
And when Svelte became
famous, there were people

258
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,847
that were actually saying that,

259
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:04,470
"Oh, I would really like to
use Svelte within Amplify,"

260
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,430
because they already had mobile
applications with Amplify

261
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,190
and on the websites,
they wanted to use Svelte

262
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,500
for whatever reason, "because I liked it."

263
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,640
And so, I said, okay, let's
help and get that out there.

264
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,270
And now, Svelte is fully
supported in Amplify

265
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,572
and I think it's something
that we should continue doing.

266
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:27,750
(attendees chattering)

267
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,580
- And I know there's a lot
going on on that slide,

268
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,130
but those are not random features.

269
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,280
So, our mental model about
Amplify is that we want

270
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,443
to build you a framework

271
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:41,443
that is a rock solid foundation
for production-grade apps.

272
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,600
And all of those things
that we have built in,

273
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,880
were also with the mindset of, okay,

274
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,620
so if you want to be part
of this new GenAI wave

275
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,180
where people are using more

276
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,860
and more things like Kiro, Lovable,

277
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,440
any vibe coding platforms,
we need to make sure

278
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
that the things that are
really hard to get right

279
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,790
are built into the framework

280
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,550
so that GenAI doesn't have to guess it.

281
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,630
And all of what we have built
here actually brings us closer

282
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,590
to a framework that can
be easier accessible by AI

283
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,970
because it does not have to guess

284
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,860
how certain things have to be done.

285
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,970
Token rotation is something

286
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,770
I don't want to have custom code for.

287
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,603
I would like to know

288
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,400
that this was tested all the
way through in production

289
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,870
and I can trust.

290
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,540
So, we have done some
strategic investments

291
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,600
into what would GenAI
need from a framework

292
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,297
to actually make things
better for customers.

293
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:38,910
(attendees chattering)

294
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,383
- So, how is Amplify with GenAI?

295
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,023
So, how many of you
are using Cursor, Kiro,

296
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:50,430
(attendees chattering)

297
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,440
- or any of those tools?

298
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,523
Okay, it's a few.

299
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,530
You should try it.

300
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,363
It's actually pretty amazing.

301
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,710
Even I as a manager now can code again,

302
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,603
which is pretty cool to see.

303
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:10,286
So, many, many times when
I was creating software

304
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,148
with one of those GenAI tools,

305
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:14,940
(attendees chattering)

306
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,520
- the suggestions were
going in the right direction

307
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,150
but they were not exactly
matching my intent.

308
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,460
So, there's a lot of context in my mind

309
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,200
of what I want to build,

310
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,120
and the only way that I can transfer it

311
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,753
into a generic GenAI tool is I prompt.

312
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,530
And I don't know if you have tried

313
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,800
but I ran into doomprompting
over and over again

314
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,170
because it just didn't get
it right in the first place

315
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,820
and then I iterated over it,

316
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,170
and at some point, I just gave up,

317
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,570
and said okay, let me do it myself.

318
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,600
So, if you ever experienced
that, this is not great.

319
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,204
So, you feel at some point like,

320
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:52,020
okay, is this GenAI thing really real?

321
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,170
Does it really help me?

322
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,380
And it feels so tedious

323
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,380
because why do I need to
explain all of those things?

324
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,560
It should be more obvious
what has to happen.

325
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,840
But GenAI does not have the context

326
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,450
of your last two years of development.

327
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,932
It does not know what Peter did last week

328
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:10,950
and it does not know

329
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,070
what was discussed in
your last sprint planning.

330
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,190
And yes, you can maybe have
something that is listening

331
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,650
to all of your
conversation, put it all in,

332
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,370
but in the context, it's too
big and doesn't work either.

333
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,910
So, let's go back to the first principles.

334
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,286
So, how do we get into a place

335
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:33,000
where GenAI knows what it needs to know

336
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,010
to make proper choices

337
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,170
in your software development lifecycle.

338
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,120
So, I hope no one of you

339
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,127
ever had to build your own JSON parser

340
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:42,930
because the Ivory's out there.

341
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,450
So, GenAI, I should not
try to reinvent the wheel

342
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,988
and build everything from scratch,

343
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,160
but using things that
are already already made.

344
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,860
So, last year,

345
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,550
the Stack Overflow survey said that 84%

346
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,670
of developers were using
GenAI on a daily basis

347
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,350
or intended to do so.

348
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,300
I guess this year, it's even higher.

349
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,653
And I didn't check.

350
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,990
The benefits are real.

351
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,814
So, you can get a lot more
things done much faster,

352
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:14,430
but it also sometimes
is tedious, as I said.

353
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,930
And so, now, what happened this year

354
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,930
is that we try to close
the gap on the context

355
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,090
that the GenAI needs to have

356
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,780
to actually make proper decisions
on what needs to happen.

357
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,760
And one emerging technology

358
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,700
in this year was the
model context protocol.

359
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,653
Model context protocol is a way

360
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:37,823
that I can define a server for GenAI

361
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:40,380
that it can actually ask certain things.

362
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,150
So, how do I do this?

363
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,250
I have the following task.

364
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,980
Is there any best
practices or documentation

365
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,520
that I might need to pull
into my context window?

366
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,460
And we have released a model

367
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,547
context protocol server called AWS MCP.

368
00:16:56,547 --> 00:17:00,180
And that one embodies
the documentation of AWS,

369
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,480
all the different, I mean, we
have a lot of documentation,

370
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,070
not only like the main documentation

371
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,450
but a lot of outlets,

372
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,483
blog posts and everything, best practices.

373
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,330
And the coolest thing about MCP,

374
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,850
it's not only documentation,
it's not like RAG,

375
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,270
it also gives you the ability

376
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,060
to define workflows in a
specific predefined manner.

377
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,480
It's called SOPs, like
standard operating procedures.

378
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,150
So, if you want to create a database,

379
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,830
it does it in a certain way

380
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,720
so that it follows best practices.

381
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,129
So, use CDK under the hood,

382
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:35,310
have a certain configuration there,

383
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,500
make sure that it's secure,

384
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,120
that your S3 buckets

385
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,540
are not publicly
available, stuff like that.

386
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,340
All of those things that otherwise,

387
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,580
you might need to go through
tedious prompt cycles

388
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,840
are already there

389
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,693
and the model can take the
right choices from the get-go.

390
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,490
So, the problem that we have seen

391
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,150
is that if you take a generic GenAI tool,

392
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,216
only in 10% of the cases,

393
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,730
it was creating production-ready software.

394
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,897
So, most of the time, it
compiled, it actually worked,

395
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,890
but all the integrated details

396
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,350
that you want to have in this code

397
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,290
and that you would choose directly,

398
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,190
they were not there, they
were not configured correctly,

399
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,250
they missed maybe the index
for your DynamoDB table.

400
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,890
They choose Aurora over Dynamo,

401
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,100
or vice versa, no matter what it is.

402
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,933
And that's why you had to iterate over it.

403
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:35,910
With MCP, we can make sure
that the choices are more valid

404
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,790
and we have created a lot more knowledge,

405
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,410
especially for Amplify as a framework

406
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,930
so that it picks up things
that are already made.

407
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,340
And the same for CDK, so
that CDK cloud formation

408
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,810
and Amplify are no strangers

409
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,243
to your tool if you use that MCP.

410
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,870
And with that, I would
like to give over to Salih

411
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,430
who will go a bit deeper into that

412
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,720
and also makes it a bit more real

413
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,940
with like a proper live demo.

414
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,190
- Let's see. (chuckles)
Thank you. (clears throat)

415
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,490
Thank you very much, Mark.

416
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,700
All right.

417
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,730
So, today, we will talk about our journey

418
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,140
from going from the vibe
into something that is real.

419
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,030
GenAI, from the hands that I see,

420
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,600
GenAI is still a bit of a
thing that we are afraid of,

421
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,500
but we have to understand

422
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,811
that this is just a tool that
is making our lives easier.

423
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:26,370
To use this tool, AWS
actually offered you a lot

424
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,000
of different options like
Mark said earlier on.

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,910
For example, we had Knowledge
MCP that was allowing you

426
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,630
to get some best practices
or example codes, and so on.

427
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,960
We had API that was
allowing you to use AWS CLI

428
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,163
to get any information from your account

429
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:46,770
so it was doing the necessary
calls for your CLI command.

430
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,320
We also had frontend MCP
that was allowing you

431
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,570
to build a frontend application with React

432
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,900
and CDK in the most
effective way possible.

433
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,570
And we had the IaC and
Serverless MCPs as well

434
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,340
that was allowing you to
use these AI agentic IDs

435
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,740
or coding tools to move forward.

436
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,651
And maybe you heard, maybe you heard not,

437
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,720
we released in the middle of July, Kiro.

438
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,250
Kiro is the agentic ID

439
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,830
that is allowing you to not only vibe code

440
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,110
but also create spec-driven developments,

441
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,990
so you tell what you want from it

442
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,813
and it actually brings it
into a more structured way.

443
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,450
Today, one more time,

444
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,697
I'm happy to announce AWS MCP.

445
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:28,380
AWS MCP is there

446
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,080
to bring the Knowledge MCP that we have

447
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,620
and the API MCP and many
others all together.

448
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,840
These MCPs are giving you a chance

449
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,610
to create your full-stack applications

450
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,370
through the procedures that
we already created for you.

451
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,876
We have created more than
30 different procedures

452
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,990
to know what to do

453
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,223
for having the best for your
agents to build an application.

454
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,300
For example, in case you wanna
search for documentation,

455
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,940
you don't need to add the
documentation MCP anymore.

456
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,950
You still can but you don't have to.

457
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,010
You now, you can use AWS MCP to call that.

458
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,240
Do you want to get some information

459
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,170
about deploying an app to Amplify?

460
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,083
You can get that information directly

461
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,510
through the SOP's 3D procedures
that we already have.

462
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,580
So.

463
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,830
(attendees chattering)

464
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,370
- I'm not going to stop.

465
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,540
I'm here to teach you. (chuckles)

466
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,350
(Salih clears throat)

467
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,700
With the AWS MCP in place, we
wanna switch to 10% into 90%,

468
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,030
so you can have
deployment-ready applications

469
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,800
through the agentic IDs.

470
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,700
If you walk around,

471
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,150
you will see this ghost sign
all around and that is Kiro.

472
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,470
With that, we are committing

473
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,250
to build an application through
agentic workflows as well.

474
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,810
We are giving you success
rate of more than 90%

475
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,560
and it brings the best
practices automatically for you.

476
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,952
And one important point is,

477
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:56,970
with large language models,
there's always this cutoff date

478
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,400
and one of the solutions to that

479
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,406
was actually the MCP servers.

480
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:03,180
Thanks to the AWS MCP,

481
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,640
now you will know that you
get the latest version of it,

482
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,120
you get all the security-related
information as well.

483
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,410
So, you know in case

484
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,180
you're frontend developers like me,

485
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,420
I have been building
frontend apps for 10 years

486
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,010
before I joined AWS,

487
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,390
and for me, AWS is still a new
role that I learn every day.

488
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,180
And if you're coming from a world like me,

489
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,140
it allows you to move faster
and learn better as well.

490
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,180
But of course, like every one of you do,

491
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,423
do not push the code from
AI into the production.

492
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,272
So, what do we offer

493
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,560
from the SOP perspective for Amplify?

494
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,850
From the Amplify perspective,

495
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,240
we have three important
SOPs that you can use.

496
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,900
One of them is the frontend
MCP that is giving you a chance

497
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,050
to use the frontend libraries of Amplify

498
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,720
to connect with the backend
structure that you build.

499
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,090
The second one is the backend one.

500
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,180
Building backend with Amplify can be easy

501
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,430
but also complicated at the same time.

502
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,690
People ask a lot of questions

503
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,270
on how to do complicated data operations.

504
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,355
Now, thanks to the MCP,

505
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,600
you can actually build these operations

506
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,630
by telling the AI on how
to do it and what to do it,

507
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,560
or even ask to learn or get
the documentation as well.

508
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,200
You don't have to let agent do its tricks.

509
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,822
You can just ask agent to
bring you the information.

510
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:24,870
You will be still the person to open this.

511
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,030
Because again, these are your tools

512
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,720
and it depends on you on how
you want to use these tools.

513
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,420
And we also have the deployment pipeline.

514
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,790
For Amplify, we have something
we call Amplify hosting

515
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,671
which again, you will see in a second.

516
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:40,410
Amplify hosting is there for you

517
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,800
to deploy your frontend application easily

518
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,970
without touching any
additional AWS services.

519
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,540
We all know CloudFront S3
works really fine and all,

520
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,220
but if you come from frontend world,

521
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,220
when you jump to the AWS console,
it's a scary time for you.

522
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,798
You know that like there are
hundreds of things writing off

523
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,790
and you don't know which one to click.

524
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,079
And we are all afraid of
paying thousands of dollars

525
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,850
by making a simple click mistake.

526
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,640
That is why these tools that allow you

527
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,857
to have that knowledge (audio
breaks) or this fear as well.

528
00:24:15,857 --> 00:24:19,800
(attendees chattering)

529
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,570
- I was about to rap down
the trademark. (chuckles)

530
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,403
All right.

531
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:27,420
So, we have the demo.

532
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,310
And today, what we are going to build

533
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,430
is I'm going to show you
two apps that I built.

534
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,380
One is the app

535
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,880
that's showcasing what we have
built in 2025 with Amplify.

536
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,790
And the second thing is
I was talking to Mark

537
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,970
about like how to communicate
with people during re:Invent

538
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,940
and I thought of bringing
the maps of re:Invent

539
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,060
and just giving people a
chance to share their location

540
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,620
for a certain time period

541
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,200
so others can see if they can find them

542
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,580
and ask them questions.

543
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,520
It's not like they dock their location,

544
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,230
it's actually you share where you are

545
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,750
so people can find you
and ask your questions.

546
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,539
So, with that, I will

547
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,820
(attendees chattering)

548
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,805
- go back to the demo.

549
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:12,150
(attendees chattering)

550
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,820
- And I'm really curious how
it's going to work with this

551
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,603
and the coding.

552
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:19,853
(attendees chattering)

553
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,370
- [Salih] First question,
can everyone read this?

554
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,800
Everything good on the backside?

555
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,270
Perfect.

556
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,725
So, this is the first
application that I built.

557
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:35,100
This application is the showcase app.

558
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,480
But the apple of my eye

559
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,480
is the map-face-meetup that I call.

560
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,492
So, let's run this application.

561
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:47,910
To run the application, this
is a simple React application.

562
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,743
So, what I'm going to do

563
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:53,743
is I will just do npm run dev, run dev.

564
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,980
And this will just run
my application locally

565
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,040
so we will see how it
looks like with mock data.

566
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,637
So, I will go back, open up my window.

567
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:07,230
(attendees clapping)
And thank you very much.

568
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,230
And 5371, I think it
was, or no, it's 8081.

569
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,088
All right.

570
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:16,530
(attendees chattering)

571
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,420
- [Salih] 8081. All right.

572
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,150
So, this is a very basic
application that I built.

573
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,640
It has the sign in and sign up flows

574
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,505
And like I can just add my...

575
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:30,755
(attendees chattering)

576
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,350
- [Salih] This is totally random stuff

577
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,100
and like just shouldn't

578
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,540
connect to the backend yet.

579
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,215
Let me check it really quickly.

580
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:47,465
(attendees chattering)

581
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,790
- [Salih] The goal of
this application is...

582
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,810
Actually, let me show you the video

583
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,311
so we can build it together.

584
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,379
(attendees chattering)

585
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:57,690
- [Salih] No, the goal of this application

586
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,000
is to showcase your real time,

587
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,530
the file upload mechanism

588
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,020
and actually just
everything that you would do

589
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,610
with authentication and so on,

590
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,220
including the pipelines
(attendee laughing)

591
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,690
that you would normally do with functions

592
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,370
and everything else as well.

593
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,435
So, I will do one more npm run dev.

594
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:15,480
(attendee laughing)

595
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,750
And I would hope that demo gods

596
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,113
would allow me to showcase you this thing.

597
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,170
I have a working version of it

598
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,483
but I really want to build this with you.

599
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,533
So, let's say that this
is my name, this is this.

600
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,280
All right, so this is how it looks like.

601
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,880
So, this is the map that you
have probably seen around

602
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,840
and this is the expo hall map
as well that I found online.

603
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,190
I hope it's correct.

604
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,110
So, what you will do is you can click here

605
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,770
and you can say that I
will be at the AWS Village.

606
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,770
You can select the
services that you know fine

607
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,450
like CloudFront, for example,

608
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,360
edit in a picture, and
it will show a marker

609
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,720
and you will automatically
see the other people

610
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,710
are going to automatically see

611
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,210
how it will look like as well.

612
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,735
So, to turn this mock data into real data,

613
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:12,450
I prepared some prompts

614
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,800
and I want to take you through the prompt

615
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
and tell you a few trips

616
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,770
and tricks to build your applications

617
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,990
through prompts as well.

618
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,310
The first thing that I wanna
tell you is creating a prompt.

619
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,200
Like we will have a one single prompt

620
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,530
just for the sake of
making it run everything.

621
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,470
But first of all, never have
a full prompt like this.

622
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,600
Split it up into multiple ones.

623
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,643
Agents are like your kids,

624
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:38,697
you have to tell them
exactly what they need

625
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:40,590
or what they need to do.

626
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,850
They will say no in the beginning

627
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,370
because again, they
will ask more questions.

628
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,530
But later on, it will come

629
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,150
to the place that you want it to be.

630
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,640
In here, I gave them, I said,

631
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,900
use Amplify Gen 2

632
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,750
and use AWS MCP server
that I have mentioned today

633
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,420
that we have released to
build this application.

634
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,155
I added an application overview

635
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,500
and I added some like backend requirements

636
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,900
on like what to do for URLs,

637
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,360
the marker, basically for everything.

638
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,190
we have Lambda triggers so I don't need

639
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,080
to do the email confirmation

640
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,150
for every user that I have created.

641
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,000
Every single detail that
I have here is there

642
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,120
so I can let this thing know

643
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,213
that it needs to do a proper
implementation for this.

644
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,747
With everything in place, what I will do

645
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:27,794
is I will add even one point here extra

646
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:31,170
and say that like make sure
you remove the mock data

647
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,332
and actually use the real data at the end.

648
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:36,582
(attendees chattering)

649
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,790
- [Salih] I don't want to
keep you on hold. (laughs)

650
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,220
That's why like, I also want
to talk at the same time.

651
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,600
In here, I was like,

652
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,340
you don't have to make things complicated.

653
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,600
You can just say,

654
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,850
(attendees chattering)

655
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,840
- [Salih] so like you can just simply say

656
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,980
what you need in one way

657
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,070
and it's important
(faintly speaks) numbered

658
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,960
so it knows what is the most important

659
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,867
and what is the structure as well.

660
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:18,746
(Salih faintly speaks)

661
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:19,773
In place.

662
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:23,760
I will just copy and paste this thing.

663
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,690
It's touching my lips now. I
feel uncomfortable. (laughs)

664
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,030
Really, like it's...

665
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,590
Okay.

666
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,580
Maybe this is better.

667
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,253
But then this way, it
feels super interesting.

668
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,740
You hear me good, right?

669
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,710
Yeah, this is how I drink my tea.

670
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,560
So, I started the session, right?

671
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,210
What it does is it takes everything

672
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,580
and first, it gets
through the application.

673
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,160
It tries to understand
what it needs to do.

674
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,360
For this, we have something

675
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,130
we call in cure streaming files.

676
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,610
Stream files are given
information about your application

677
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,700
to the agents so they don't
need to read every single file

678
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,020
but they would have an understanding

679
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,430
of what they need to do.

680
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,080
And in here, it reads everything,

681
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,700
it checks most clients

682
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,280
so it knows what it needs to change

683
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,040
and what it needs to
remove later on as well.

684
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,410
So, next thing that I wanna show is,

685
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,160
as you see, it calls something
called sop over there.

686
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,970
This sop is one of these profiles

687
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,800
or procedures that is allowing you

688
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,330
to build these applications.

689
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,240
And in here, we have Amplify
backend implementation one

690
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,070
that I had mentioned earlier on

691
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,900
and it is calling them directly.

692
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,100
So, I will just call it,

693
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,100
it will get that information
and showcases directly.

694
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,970
Like I said, we also have the frontend

695
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,310
for the frontend libraries.

696
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,570
We also have the deployment

697
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,360
for deployment part of things as well.

698
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,810
It might need to call
some AWS CLI as well.

699
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,923
Then, it will call AWS
tool inside it as well.

700
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,068
How many of you have not
heard of MCP servers before?

701
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:55,470
(attendees chattering)

702
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,593
- [Salih] Okay.

703
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,400
For the few folks, I want
to give a very basic example

704
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,590
that everyone gives me as well.

705
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,039
MCP server...

706
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,289
(attendees chattering)

707
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,170
- [Salih] Is it for me? Okay.

708
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,170
MCP servers are basically universal buses

709
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,480
for your agents to get information

710
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,667
in the most efficient way possible.

711
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,543
This allows you

712
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:21,660
to get the latest information
from a third party

713
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,640
or official party immediate.

714
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,990
Earlier on, we needed to do,

715
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,880
for example, vector database and so on

716
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,647
to bring these informations.

717
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:33,326
But MCP changes a way
that we build things.

718
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,510
It's not also the lifesaver thing.

719
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,750
Like you shouldn't put
your very delicate data

720
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,208
to the MCP as well. (chuckles)

721
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,041
It's not secure.

722
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,660
It's basically allowing you
to expand the knowledge.

723
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,710
So, large language models cut off date

724
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:51,060
doesn't mean to you at
the end because of this.

725
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,720
Anyway, we are creating this stuff.

726
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,330
In the meantime, it does that.

727
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,070
I wanna also showcase
the other application

728
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,970
that we have built

729
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,533
and I wanna showcase what we
have built in Amplify in 2025.

730
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:04,710
How many of you have built an application

731
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,633
with Amplify Gen 2 before?

732
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,540
Nice. All right.

733
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,120
So, let's showcase from there.

734
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,202
I will say I trust you,
you can do this thing.

735
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,320
(attendees chattering)

736
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,270
- [Salih] And I will go back.

737
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,970
So, for building an Amplify application,

738
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,050
(attendees chattering)

739
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,150
- [Salih] when this is
bigger is more visible.

740
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,620
For building an Amplify application,

741
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,987
you have to initialize
the app by installing,

742
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:34,590
by saying NPM create Amplify,

743
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,830
and this will create this
Amplify folder that you see here.

744
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,433
From the Amplify perspective,
the most important one

745
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:43,380
is the backend.ts file that we have here.

746
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,200
The backend.ts file keeps the
infrastructure information

747
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,770
that you need about
Amplify or overall AWS.

748
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,495
And you can add any feature

749
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,180
or any service that you want

750
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,850
in the human readable way
like auth, storage, and so on.

751
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,640
And to build them, you need
to create an auth folder

752
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,190
or storage folder, or any
folder that you want to build

753
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,570
with the service that you want.

754
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,250
And these things will allow you

755
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,837
to just get these all together,

756
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:12,240
make a composition of your
infrastructure directly.

757
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,560
For example, for authentication,

758
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,310
we say I have the email authentication

759
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,170
and I want to have a
multi-factor authentication

760
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,280
because we released it this
year as well with email.

761
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,120
To use the multi-factor
authentication, Cognito asks you

762
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,380
to have a phone number
alongside it as well.

763
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,150
So, you have to have it too.

764
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,890
And the sender of the email

765
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,730
to get the confirmation is
like one email that I have.

766
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,190
And from the storage
perspective, it's just an image,

767
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,340
and we will showcase how the
storage browser works as well.

768
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,340
In here, we define the
storage as the name.

769
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,790
The name defines the
beginning part of your bucket

770
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,730
because S3, as you know,
has universal naming.

771
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,410
So, it needs to be unique.

772
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:59,070
And we have the rules for
public, protected and private.

773
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,635
Private is for you.

774
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:03,870
Protected is for everyone authenticated

775
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,030
and public is for everyone.

776
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,230
With this in place, let me
showcase how they look like.

777
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,240
So, we have this application,

778
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
we have the web storage, email MFA,

779
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,513
and web authentication to
showcase everything to you.

780
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,740
So, first of all, let me show
the authentication workflow.

781
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,295
With authentication workflow in place,

782
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:27,960
I will showcase the Passkey.

783
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,490
Passkey is the new way

784
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,310
of authenticating through your biometrics.

785
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,710
If your platform supports through camera,

786
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,830
you can do facial recognition,
finger recognition,

787
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,425
whatever you find useful,
you can do it that way.

788
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:44,010
How we do it is through two things.

789
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,480
You can have your custom name

790
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,250
or we have a ready-to-use UI
component called authenticator.

791
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,590
An authenticator
basically looks like this.

792
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,730
We have the sign in

793
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,850
and create account so you
can just create an account.

794
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,370
I will just use my burner account

795
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,290
because my Amazon email didn't work

796
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,353
so I will use the other one.

797
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:06,020
(keys clacking)

798
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,070
So, it will automatically
send a confirmation email.

799
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,400
Now, I will read the
confirmation email quickly.

800
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,749
And with the confirmation email,

801
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,820
I will be able to log in and
do everything that I need.

802
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,433
So, let me use that one very quickly.

803
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,410
I know I can trust you

804
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,000
but I still want to make sure

805
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,690
that (chuckles) I have
the right information.

806
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,060
All right, so let's go back to the demo.

807
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,290
So, I have my code in place,
right, and I'm confirming that.

808
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,540
And once I confirm that now I'm inside

809
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,310
and I have my email and so on.

810
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:57,330
To register new Passkey,
we have directly APIs,

811
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,760
directly functions that you
can call from our libraries.

812
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,593
So, I click here

813
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,730
and it'll automatically
showcase the email address.

814
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,070
And once I selected the profile,

815
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,500
it will directly edit on Chrome.

816
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,417
So, if I sign out now and go
back to sign in with Passkey

817
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,130
and click on this button,
it will show me that.

818
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,313
And when I use my finger,
it will allow me to log in.

819
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,950
So, this was more

820
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,110
or less the Passkey
approach with biometrics.

821
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,850
The second one that I wanna showcase

822
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,120
is in the meantime, I
wanna check out the...

823
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,743
And this thing is, it is
reading every information.

824
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,320
Another one that I wanna
showcase is the storage browser.

825
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,240
Storage browser is a plugin

826
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,197
and use kind of component that
like we have here as well.

827
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:51,240
This allows you to use
S3 without extra hustle.

828
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,403
We have UI components directly you can use

829
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:55,920
with the structure that you have built.

830
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,600
For example, in the protected one,

831
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,750
like we have nothing here,
I can just upload an image

832
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,903
by dropping, something I
will just drop very quickly.

833
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,025
- Okay.
- Tss, tss, tss.

834
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:11,275
(attendees chattering)

835
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,550
- [Salih] All right,
let's go back to demo.

836
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,010
So, you can see that
like, I put an image here

837
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,010
and I can just click on the Upload button.

838
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,745
Once I click on the Upload button,

839
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:27,960
I can go back to the protected

840
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,490
and I can, for example,

841
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,070
display the image that has been created.

842
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,750
I can click on Download

843
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,620
to be able to download the
directly, like it is here.

844
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,690
I can also do simple operations

845
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,570
like deleting and so on as well.

846
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,403
With all of these,

847
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:46,410
imagine you can just do
it with one line of code.

848
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,150
You don't need to think about how to do it

849
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,200
and what to do it.

850
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,360
Everything is happening
through Amplify's way

851
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,573
of building apps, which
is, let me go back,

852
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,300
which is through the
amplify_outputs.json file here.

853
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,370
It keeps all the information that we need

854
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,410
and it allows us to share this

855
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,960
through the components as well.

856
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,310
But this is not it.

857
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,930
We have more things to showcase.

858
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,680
In the meantime, other thing works.

859
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,490
And I wanna showcase

860
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,710
the multi-factor authentication as well.

861
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,780
Last year, we have announced the TOTP.

862
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,400
So, you can use the authenticator apps

863
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,430
like Google Authenticator
and Authy, and so on.

864
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,600
And you can enable it

865
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,050
with one click or one call to the APIs.

866
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,035
And this way, now if I
sign out and if I sign in,

867
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:38,702
(keys clacking)

868
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,050
now it will ask for a
confirmation code to me.

869
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,910
And the confirmation code should
be coming to here as well.

870
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,963
Yeah, sure, sure.

871
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,340
Yeah, the confirmation
code is here as well.

872
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,340
So, I can click, close it, go
back, and paste this one here.

873
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,970
So, if I confirm now

874
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,640
I have the multi-factor
authen (audio breaks)

875
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,190
For all of these, what
we did was two things.

876
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,397
One was calling the library
like from the frontend.

877
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:18,330
And second thing

878
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,360
was you have seen the
authentication workflow, right?

879
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,190
Adding this information

880
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,010
about the auth here was the way to go.

881
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,440
Like adding this true
(audio breaks) to go.

882
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,753
Let's do a time check. All right.

883
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,815
So, we have showcased like multi-factor,

884
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:37,710
we have showcased the storage, and so on.

885
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,180
I will take you through the code

886
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,930
but before I do, I want to
check out what we are doing.

887
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,553
It is doing some changes, that's good.

888
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,980
Meanwhile it does that,

889
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,830
let's go back and check out the code.

890
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,780
For the storage, for the UI component,

891
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,780
what you need to check out
is how we are using this.

892
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,810
Let me showcase the storage page.

893
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,683
In the storage page, we have
many components that we have,

894
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,980
that we have used like
about the like description,

895
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,050
the storage browser,
and so on and so forth.

896
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,300
This allows us to...

897
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,283
Something's moving forward.

898
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,213
Another one, okay.

899
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,280
So, this allows us to actually

900
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,400
bring in the storage
browser directly into place.

901
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,460
So, start, let me find the code.

902
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,263
It's really hard with the second...

903
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:40,668
Component.

904
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,813
So, if I go to the demo here,

905
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:51,226
you have to show.

906
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:54,476
(attendees chattering)

907
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,610
- [Salih] Yes.

908
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,543
So, everything that we have here,

909
00:41:57,543 --> 00:42:01,230
like we are first
configuring the browser here,

910
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,130
the Amplify here.

911
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,420
Before we use the Amplify libraries,

912
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,850
we have to pass in the
information directly.

913
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,610
The search browser here gets the adapter

914
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,830
to get the authentication,
not only authentication,

915
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,810
but authorization flow work as well.

916
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,700
Search browser works directly

917
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,340
through the UI components
that you have created.

918
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,590
And you can just embed it into anything,

919
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,477
including the card components as well.

920
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:23,760
And here, you can see that
we have the authenticator.

921
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,950
In case the user is not authenticated,

922
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,590
we don't wanna showcase
them the storage browser.

923
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,650
So, everything can be
through this one line of code

924
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,713
that is coming from the
Amplify UI libraries itself.

925
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,593
All right.

926
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:38,670
So, let me go back

927
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,640
and in the meantime, what it does,

928
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,650
I wanna showcase you one last thing

929
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,430
and how we have deployed it,
how AWS Amplify hosting works.

930
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,220
And this year, we also
announced rough support

931
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,880
which will allow you to have
firewall mechanism easier.

932
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,380
So, let's go back

933
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,500
and let me again, go for a moment,

934
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,333
so I can log in

935
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,653
really quickly.

936
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:09,822
All right.

937
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:11,880
All right. So, let me go back to demo.

938
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,700
So, in the AWS Amplify,
if you go to AWS Amplify,

939
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,160
you will see either an empty page,

940
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,090
in case you didn't do it,

941
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,190
or every application
that you have created.

942
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,440
For Amplify, I've showcased,

943
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,330
we have this application in place.

944
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,680
Everything that I've shown you

945
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,060
was out of the deployment stuff,

946
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,340
so I didn't use the local version for it.

947
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,361
So, you can see this is the real one.

948
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:35,790
So, you can see that you can
see the previous deployments,

949
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,550
the statuses, the problems
that happen with them.

950
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,000
Also for hosting, you can
have many different approaches

951
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,220
and one of them is the firewall.

952
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,900
With this one click here,

953
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,890
now you can have rough support directly

954
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,980
so you can prevent additional
attacks, and so on, to happen

955
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,640
to your Amplify frontend
applications with the single click.

956
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,320
It allows you to protect yourself

957
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,840
from the common
vulnerabilities automatically,

958
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,460
malicious actors.

959
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,920
For example, someone might try

960
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,360
to just send a user agent call

961
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,040
like my user agent or something,

962
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,360
and if it port,

963
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,880
it will automatically trigger
backend calls directly.

964
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,380
And of course, block IP
addresses to (audio breaks)

965
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,938
We did see what we are doing. Still...

966
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:24,330
(attendees chattering)

967
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,290
- Let's...

968
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,123
(attendees chattering)

969
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,990
- I'm very happy that Salih

970
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,600
could actually do a live demo one-handed

971
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,510
with a mic holding in the other hand.

972
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,663
I don't know if I would've dare to try.

973
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,460
So, what you could see
is that there was a lot

974
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,210
of complex features like
Passkey, storage browser,

975
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,410
web application firewall,
all kinds of things.

976
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,980
But the amount of code
necessary was like in the 20s

977
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,170
of lines of code instead of hundreds.

978
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,153
If you try to do a Boto3 application

979
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,916
with all the SDK codes,

980
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:02,430
and because it's so little code necessary

981
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,020
and we can guide the AI

982
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,490
to actually use those few
pieces ready-made components,

983
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,070
it is much easier to review.

984
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,896
I mean, I don't know if
you have seen a 600 line PR

985
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:19,920
on GitHub with just a ship it underneath

986
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,920
and a 10-line request that
got like 10 comments on it.

987
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,790
But that's where we are.

988
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,890
So, you see like hundreds of lines of code

989
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,312
and at some point, you
say, yeah, okay, go ahead.

990
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,903
Okay, so for 2026,

991
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:37,290
this is something that
we plan for Amplify.

992
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,730
So, first and foremost,

993
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,163
we want to get deeper
integration with CDK.

994
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:42,627
That is also because CDK

995
00:45:42,627 --> 00:45:46,440
and Amplify are in one team underneath me.

996
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,850
And what we want to have

997
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,670
is that you have more escape
patches that you can use,

998
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,740
more constructs that you can use,

999
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:57,510
more components within AWS
without having to do custom.

1000
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,210
And if you think about a framework,

1001
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,409
usually frameworks have a certain limit

1002
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:03,690
and then you're stuck.

1003
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,830
If you want to do something custom,

1004
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,320
you need to do a lot
of handstands to do it.

1005
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,700
But in our case,

1006
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,228
we actually want to give
you the full power of AWS

1007
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:14,070
but with everything with sensible defaults

1008
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,593
that most of you need, like
we can cater to the 95%

1009
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:20,070
and the 5% should still have a good time

1010
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,980
to actually escape where they need to go.

1011
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,480
Amplify libraries, working
with any other IaC platform

1012
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,920
is something that we have in mind.

1013
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,610
If you have created your stuff
with Terraform beforehand,

1014
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,410
I don't mind, that's fine,

1015
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,460
but Amplify should be able

1016
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,290
to recognize what infrastructure there is

1017
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,180
and actually apply that.

1018
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,160
And we would like to go even deeper

1019
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,770
on integration with other AI tools.

1020
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,440
And because we are an
open source framework,

1021
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,440
please reach out over
GitHub, over Discord,

1022
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,220
to tell us what you need for
your application development.

1023
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,560
And the last but not least,

1024
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,140
the database MCP is part of my teams.

1025
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,140
We will get more and
more deep SOPs in there

1026
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,973
to actually help you

1027
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:05,760
to get things out life
as quickly as possible.

1028
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,593
So.

1029
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:10,758
(attendees chattering)

1030
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,450
There you go. So, okay.

1031
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,960
So, please reach out to us,

1032
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,810
the Amplify documentation on GitHub.

1033
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,370
If you really want to give us feedback,

1034
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,600
if you have feature requests,

1035
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,910
please, please, please give them to us.

1036
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,170
And on Amplify Discord

1037
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,083
to really have conversation
with my team directly.

1038
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,200
And at the end of this talk,

1039
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,790
I would really like to ask
you to also go to that survey.

1040
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,530
We would like to know a little bit better

1041
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:44,760
on how you use IaC, what
you actually demand there,

1042
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,040
how your experience is using it,

1043
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,230
and what you can do to improve it further.

1044
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,690
So, CDK and cloud formation,

1045
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,940
we are all trying to get
things forward for you

1046
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,220
so that you can have a good time.

1047
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,929
And let's see if the
application now is deployed.

1048
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:04,080
- Almost there.
- Almost there.

1049
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,090
- Okay, we are almost there.

1050
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,730
I know with a lot of setbacks, and so on,

1051
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:12,150
it was a very interesting session.

1052
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,550
But thanks for sticking
around. Thanks for being here.

1053
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,750
For us, it's really important

1054
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,790
that we tell you like everything

1055
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,400
that we have done for re:Invent,

1056
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,100
not only re:Invent, but
also for Amplify as well.

1057
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,730
Amplify is one of those
I would say services

1058
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,950
that is like very close to my heart

1059
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,240
and I'm really happy

1060
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,730
that we can showcase what
we have built around it.

1061
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,340
So, right now, it says
it built everything.

1062
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,910
It actually deleted the
mock files and so on.

1063
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,943
So, let's see if
everything is working fine.

1064
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,270
We will start off with,

1065
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:49,650
I hope with a proper sign in flow.

1066
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,570
Then, afterwards, we will let the marker.

1067
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,640
And if it works, that will be great.

1068
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,640
If it doesn't, then I will share
the code with you later on.

1069
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,180
I will open source it hopefully

1070
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,400
so you can try it yourself as well.

1071
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,800
All right, so everything
is in place. Let's go.

1072
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,753
Let's create a new user.

1073
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:13,368
(object thuds)
(attendees chattering)

1074
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,620
- [Salih] So, like first
thing that people see

1075
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,922
is it is directly say that, okay,

1076
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:31,380
the account is created,
everything place this.

1077
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,330
So, once the account is created,

1078
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,770
it will send an information, and so on.

1079
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,470
But I didn't want this, I
actually wanted it to skip it.

1080
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,124
So, you can add this flow
directly into it as well.

1081
00:49:41,124 --> 00:49:43,020
And it should have. But let's see.

1082
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,363
So, let's see what it did for Amplify.

1083
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,490
Yeah, for the pre-sign up,
we have everything in place.

1084
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,470
So, maybe it was just a simple error.

1085
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,453
Let's see how we can log in.

1086
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,160
There's already a signing user. I know.

1087
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,113
Let me in.

1088
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,313
All right, let's do one more
round and we will be good.

1089
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,820
Let's see if we can see the
problem and fix it immediately.

1090
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,720
So, right now,

1091
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,619
what it does is it actually
confirm user and everything,

1092
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,772
but it is not allowing to move forward.

1093
00:50:32,772 --> 00:50:36,118
So, the issue might be
around (faintly speaks)

1094
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:38,340
the auth flow, the auth component.

1095
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,823
And once (faintly speaks) directly.

1096
00:50:44,413 --> 00:50:48,540
It will check directly the
state, which is your state,

1097
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,370
use auth is controlling the state

1098
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,110
for the authentication for the app

1099
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,320
and it uploads everything
and checks out run build.

1100
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,153
You can see

1101
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,230
that for every change that
it does, it permits stuff.

1102
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,670
This is what I tell them to do,

1103
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,700
- Sounds awful.
- tell it to do so it can know

1104
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,693
what I have changed and so on as well.

1105
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:05,526
(mic thuds)

1106
00:51:05,526 --> 00:51:08,640
And once everything in
place, we will continue.

1107
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,350
This is also not work.

1108
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,903
- [Staff] It keeps dropping out.

1109
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:15,468
(audio breaks)

1110
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,090
- [Staff] Sorry, everybody.

1111
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,710
We're working on the problem.
(Salih chuckles)

1112
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,970
- [Salih] This might be the only station

1113
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:21,930
in re:Invent history

1114
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,433
to have five or six different
(laughs) microphones in place.

1115
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:28,170
(staff faintly speaking)

1116
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,003
- Yeah.

1117
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,460
All right, we are like, we started off.

1118
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:37,230
Let me open up the DevConnect here.

1119
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,896
Let me to refresh and log in.

1120
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:44,563
(keys clacking)

1121
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,953
Come on.

1122
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,920
I will just do one more thing.

1123
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,170
If it doesn't work, I will cheat.

1124
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,820
And I already have a deployed version.

1125
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,520
I will just showcase you that one.

1126
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:02,562
(keys clacking)

1127
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,173
Yes.

1128
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,470
So, we logged in

1129
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,450
and once we logged in, the
next thing that we will do

1130
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:22,920
is to like add a location here.

1131
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,823
I will say expo at the Venetian.

1132
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:28,490
(keys clacking)

1133
00:52:30,078 --> 00:52:31,170
(Salih fantly speaking)

1134
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,340
I will just say, for example,

1135
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,470
I'm an expert in like API gateway,

1136
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,360
it will add the user directly.

1137
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,520
And you can see that
we have something here.

1138
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,470
You can also upload images too.

1139
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,720
So, I can just click on here

1140
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,713
and say again,

1141
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,340
Aria, like I stay at Aria,
so I will just write Aria.

1142
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,500
And say ECS.

1143
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,180
And no worries at all.

1144
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,810
And I will just select in

1145
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,880
image that is showing me.

1146
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,070
And I will just upload that image.

1147
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,170
And once that image is
uploaded, you can see

1148
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,770
that it actually brought
everything together so it cascaded.

1149
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,140
And when I come in,

1150
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,300
you can see that both of
the markers has changed

1151
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,000
because I added my image.

1152
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,770
And when I create a new user,

1153
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,390
it will showcase the others as well.

1154
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,623
So, demo worked.

1155
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,174
The storage happened, everything.

1156
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:29,910
And we can slowly take time (audio breaks)

1157
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,900
everyone sticking (audio breaks)
