1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,990
- Okay, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,990
Welcome to COP350, building
and validating cloud controls.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Make sure all of you have your headsets on

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,763
so you don't miss out on the
fun that I'm about to speak.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,463
And thank you for joining us
today, late in the afternoon.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,520
So my name is Pal Patel.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,804
I am a senior solutions architect,

8
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:32,460
specializing in cloud governance on AWS.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,680
And I'm joined today by Rodolfo Brenes,

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,560
who is a principal solutions architect

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,973
on the same team with me.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,140
So every time I open my Amazon app,

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,020
I recently bought a home,
so I do a lot of purchasing,

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,780
or I'm doing a lot of purchasing lately.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,500
I tell myself that I'm
only going to buy one item,

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,900
just one, a $20 item.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,400
But 10 minutes later,

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,660
my cart looks like I am going
to open a new data center.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,640
I add one cable, and somehow
I end up with a standing desk,

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,850
a label printer, another monitor arm,

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,973
and a chair named after
a Scandinavian forest.

22
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,960
And all this while Amazon is on the side,

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,000
going like, "Yeah, people who bought this,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,890
they bought a whole new
lifestyle on Amazon."

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,150
I'm like, "Yeah, I feel great

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,590
about finding all these products,

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,170
but my credit card, not so much."

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,170
So if only I had like
this intelligent guardrail

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,940
for my shopping cart that would go like,

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,100
not like, "Stop, do not buy this."

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,933
But more like,

32
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,250
"Hey, maybe you don't need
this third monitor arm,"

33
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,360
or, "This is the duplicate
of the item I bought,

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,700
panic bought last week."

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,190
And then it's it more like...

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,990
And, sorry, so where was I?

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,410
Yeah, imagine I had like a
guardrail for my shopping cart

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,580
that would not just stop me,

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,603
but quietly nudge me
to make right decisions

40
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:06,240
and kind of safeguard my bank balance.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,140
Now, thankfully, I do
have my husband for that.

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,120
Like, we share my Amazon account.

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,990
So next morning, most of the
items in my cart do disappear

44
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,290
and only the items that
he thinks we need remains.

45
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,480
I call it unauthorized access,

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,853
but he calls it cost optimization.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,488
So now going from there,

48
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:32,790
just like my cart needs
intelligent guardrails,

49
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,750
so does your Amazon AWS environment.

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,010
And how do we do that?

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,740
That's what we are going to
explore through this session.

52
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,770
So I have a really
simple agenda for today.

53
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,200
I will briefly start exploring

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,900
with the pressure that people feel

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,530
to innovate while still
maintaining security and governance

56
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,760
in their environment.

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,650
Then Rodolfo here will deep dive

58
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,910
into the foundations of AWS
governance services on AWS

59
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,480
and then also talking
about some latest launches

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,980
for these services.

61
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,410
And finally, I will demonstrate

62
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,103
how generative AI can accelerate
the governance for you.

63
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,370
So in my day-to-day
conversations with customers,

64
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,930
when I talk about governance,

65
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,200
it's not so much about how to innovate,

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,220
but it's about how to
accelerate and automate safely.

67
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,890
Like, think about it, a single team today,

68
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,340
they can launch hundreds of thousands

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,940
of dollar worths cloud
resources within minutes.

70
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,490
But if you have to track their ownership,

71
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,710
if you have to maintain their governance,

72
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,870
their compliance, that can take time.

73
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,410
Like, people today are
building AI models within days,

74
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,620
but getting them shipped
and deployed in production,

75
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,750
it takes time, and for good reasons.

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,660
So businesses, they expect speed,

77
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,800
but governance expects
assurance, and it takes time.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,100
And deployments and reviews, they are not,

79
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,090
or they often move at
fundamentally different speed.

80
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,670
So the opportunity here is clear,

81
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,490
like, governance shouldn't slow us down,

82
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,750
but we have to find, like,
ways to accelerate it,

83
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,590
validate it,

84
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,320
but without losing the
assurance that it provides.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,253
So you don't scale mistakes
instead of your environment.

86
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,620
So, how do you do that?

87
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,980
How do you accelerate governance?

88
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,000
And that is where generative
AI can really help,

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and which is what I'm going to
explore through this session.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,910
So it can really help
shift your governance

91
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,110
from being a gatekeeper, or
just a gatekeeper to an enabler.

92
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,130
So imagine, instead of
manually reviewing compliance

93
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,500
for multiple AWS accounts,

94
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,800
you would just describe
that in a natural language

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,920
and it could give you
automated compliance checks,

96
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,650
or crafting a custom config rule

97
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,930
that can take days for you,

98
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,480
you would just describe in plain English,

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,500
and have an automated
deployable config control.

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,240
And for audit reasons,

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,963
gen AI can correlate findings
from Config, CloudTrail,

102
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,660
Security Hub events,

103
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,680
and then show you the gaps
and suggest the remediations

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,623
that before even it
becomes a compliance issue.

105
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,110
So moving on from these possibilities,

106
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,650
let's talk about
real-world implementation.

107
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,930
So I want to introduce you to Nita,

108
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,920
who is a lead CloudOps
engineer at AnyCompany.

109
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,230
She's the builder behind the controls.

110
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,150
And her team is responsible

111
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,240
for managing 300 plus AWS accounts

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
compliant and operational.

113
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,600
And like many of you, she's
always looking for making

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,590
or deploying controls in a
faster, safer, and smarter way.

115
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,040
And that's where she
turned to explore gen AI,

116
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,810
not as a shortcut to governance,

117
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,020
but more as a way to remove the friction

118
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,463
from building controls.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,410
Now, as Nita explored opportunities

120
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,690
to improve her team's governance,

121
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,420
these were the challenges
that stood out to her

122
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,280
for her environment,

123
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,830
maintaining consistent controls at scale.

124
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,060
So as her environments and
AWS accounts keeps growing,

125
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,100
it becomes increasingly important

126
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,520
for her to have consistent controls.

127
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,643
Then their governance today
is very much reactive.

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,800
So, like they have ways to
detect non-compliant issues,

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,640
but they have limited
capability to prevent the issues

130
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,850
or prevent the non-compliant
actions from happening.

131
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,630
And while they are using
Control Tower Account Factory

132
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,153
to seamlessly provision their accounts,

133
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,420
applying account customizations,

134
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,280
it takes significant time
and pressure for a team.

135
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,340
So this is where she brings in Bob.

136
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,903
And I'll hand over.

137
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,760
- Thank you, Pal.

138
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,740
All right, so let's talk
a little bit about Bob

139
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,573
and his role.

140
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:17,610
So Bob, in this AnyCompany example,

141
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,350
he's one of our AI leads,

142
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,350
and he's gonna work with
Nita's team, operations team,

143
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,380
to actually build a
governance strategy, right?

144
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,660
One of the key things that we
are focusing in this example

145
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,060
is that we're gonna
start with this strategy,

146
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,480
but it needs to be agile enough
to actually keep the pace

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,760
of the innovation that we
want to achieve, right?

148
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,140
But in order to get started,

149
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,440
we need to actually start
looking at the foundations.

150
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,980
And Bob starts exploring all
the different AWS services

151
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,590
that can actually help us with this.

152
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,395
And, well, let's start with a very basic,

153
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,982
one of the longstanding services in AWS,

154
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:53,580
that is CloudTrail, right?

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,860
CloudTrail allows you to capture events

156
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,890
from, let's say, console logins, right,

157
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,810
control plane events, to data events,

158
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,520
to network activity events, right?

159
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,353
What is the activity

160
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:06,480
that is going through your
VPC endpoints, for example.

161
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,100
It allows you to capture all that activity

162
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,110
and actually aggregate that, store that,

163
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,450
could be in S3, could
be in CloudWatch Logs,

164
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,910
and allows you to take
actions on it, right?

165
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,940
What happens is if somebody
created an new EC2, right?

166
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,870
Who created it?

167
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,030
And then you can run investigations of it.

168
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,950
And you can review that from places

169
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,180
that you can store that on S3,

170
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,220
you can actually deploy
your dashboards on it,

171
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,900
or you can actually use managed services

172
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,600
like CloudTrail Lake in order to do that.

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,171
Well, he started looking at CloudTrail,

174
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:35,130
say, "Okay, let's take a look
on what has been launched

175
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,330
in the past few months."

176
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,060
So we're gonna focus,

177
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,430
we're gonna start actually
looking at the two

178
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,500
that are related here for data events.

179
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,333
As I mentioned,

180
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,340
data events is one of the
types of CloudTrail activity

181
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,490
that can be tracked
using AWS as a service.

182
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,480
So these normally are high-volume events.

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,250
So, for example, it is tracking

184
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,980
how many objects has
been stored on S3, right?

185
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,690
How many invocations to your lambdas?

186
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,020
And that could be, like,
a lot of logs, right?

187
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,760
So data events insights

188
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,410
allows you to, the tech anomalies here,

189
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,090
and this is something
that it has been available

190
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,170
for management events.

191
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,660
Now, it available for data events as well.

192
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,809
So allows you to actually realize

193
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,500
that something abnormal is happening

194
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,630
so you can actually review those.

195
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,120
And event aggregation is
for those high-volumes,

196
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,530
allows you to identify patterns.

197
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,110
What it's doing is actually
taking that information,

198
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,880
aggregate that on five-minute windows,

199
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,490
so you can actually
perform an investigation

200
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,976
to see if there's something
that has been happening

201
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,300
in the past few days, right?

202
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,250
So it allows you to ease
those investigations

203
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,640
on those data events that
you're getting from there.

204
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,440
And the last one that he realized

205
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,470
that it was launched is
CloudTrail Lake Event Enrichment.

206
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,000
So, as I mentioned, CloudTrail
Lake is a managed data store

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,890
that allows customers to aggregate data

208
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,260
from their whole organization
in one single place.

209
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,350
And then on that, you can
actually provide business context

210
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,390
into that event, right?

211
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,860
And this is done through, for example,

212
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,750
tax and the resources
that are been involved,

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,390
or the principles that were
actually taking that action.

214
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,860
So this is a very powerful mechanism

215
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,740
that Bob starts realizing that
they can definitely leverage.

216
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,220
And also, he realize that the event size

217
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,200
has been actually increased,

218
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,410
from 256 kilobytes to one megabyte.

219
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,390
So now all that enrichment can be done

220
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,860
and can provide you context

221
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,360
while you're doing investigations.

222
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,640
So, this is one of the
things that he starts doing,

223
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,210
and then say, "Well, definitely
context is very important,

224
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,043
what else is there?"

225
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,910
So he stumbles into Config.

226
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,370
Config is a service
that actually aggregates

227
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,800
and sits on top of CloudTrail data

228
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,230
and provides that configuration
history of that resource.

229
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,570
So gives you metadata on
that particular resource,

230
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,400
gives you the historical changes

231
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,380
based on, let's say,
compliance evaluation.

232
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,130
So it allows you to actually
assess that configuration

233
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,480
within your resources,

234
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,150
so you can run evaluations,
as Pal was explaining,

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,100
regarding to, let's say, if it is matching

236
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,110
on a specific steps, right?

237
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,030
If it's a desired configuration

238
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,140
that I want to have in there.

239
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,960
So this is basically when you
start setting up your controls

240
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,793
and making sure

241
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:05,700
that Pal is not buying more
stuff that she needs, right?

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,060
And it allows you to
remediate that on top of it.

243
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,000
So, let's say, it could be
natively done from Config,

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,490
or you can actually use
services like EventBridge

245
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,500
to remediate a non-compliance service.

246
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,760
And now, of course, at the end,

247
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,930
it provides you the capability

248
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,480
for you to audit your
environments in a certain way.

249
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,130
Let's say, following
a specific regulation,

250
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,780
or even internal policies that you have

251
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,850
and says, "Well, this is very good.

252
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,640
I have a couple of services
that can help me now."

253
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,350
Let's see what config
actually has launched

254
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,520
in the last few months.

255
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
The first one is the
service-linked recorder.

256
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,130
This is that we started the
year working with an integration

257
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,690
with what is called a
service-linked recorder

258
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,550
that allows other AWS services

259
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,240
to take actions on your
behalf using Config.

260
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,397
A great example of this is
the launch with CloudWatch.

261
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:51,870
CloudWatch now allows you
to actually take audit

262
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,580
on your telemetry data.

263
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,543
Let's say, if you wanna make sure

264
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:58,140
that all your EC2 instance
are using detail monitoring,

265
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,314
Config uses Config, I'm sorry,

266
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:03,240
CloudWatch uses Config data
to give you, let's say,

267
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,860
an evaluation of those resources,

268
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,780
as well as things like VPC flow logs,

269
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,650
or even having traces enabled
in your lambdas environments.

270
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,250
Security Hub, we just launched
the new experience yesterday.

271
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,660
It went GA.

272
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,160
And this also is using this.

273
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,170
So now you can just go to Security Hub,

274
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,003
enable what you need,

275
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:22,680
and it will be taken care
of Config on your behalf

276
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,830
using this integration.

277
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,980
And in terms of coverage,

278
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,240
we have been increasing the
automation around Config.

279
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,990
So now we, just last week,

280
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,750
we launched over, I think,
the couple of weeks before,

281
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,350
we just launched over 50 services

282
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,730
to the services that are covered,

283
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,830
as well as over 50 new managed rules.

284
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,320
And this is something
that keeps improving.

285
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,700
But then, as you start seeing,

286
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,070
there's a lot of changes
in these services.

287
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,470
So, start looking, "Okay,
is there something else

288
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,477
that can help me actually
build all this," right,

289
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:53,520
"in a managed way?"

290
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,110
And that's when we start
looking at Control Tower.

291
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,170
Control Tower allows me
to deploy a landing zone

292
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,240
where I'm gonna store all my resources,

293
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,950
and I can do that following best practices

294
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,690
for multi account, for example.

295
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,460
It allows me to establish that foundation

296
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,990
to eventually move forward

297
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,960
to how much I can automate
an account provision.

298
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,890
And this is also something

299
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,840
that is already embedded in the service.

300
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,850
And then I can start
working with controls.

301
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,150
There is a controls catalog
within Control Tower

302
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,370
that allows me not just to
deploy detective mechanisms,

303
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,880
but also going to, let's say,
preventive and proactive.

304
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,750
And with preventative,

305
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,690
I can actually go to AWS org policies,

306
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,520
I can deploy things like
service control policies,

307
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,530
resource control policies from the catalog

308
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,840
using the service.

309
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,140
And let's take on what is
new in Control Tower as well.

310
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,130
So Bob's realized

311
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,870
that there is a
comprehensive control catalog

312
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,790
that was launched actually last week.

313
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,330
And now he, even though
maybe he don't need to start

314
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,440
with the landing zone right now,

315
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,800
he just wants to go and start
deploying those controls

316
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,290
without actually taking that path

317
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,540
into a multi-cloud just now.

318
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,630
So the control catalog now can be accessed

319
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,130
individually of the landing zone setting.

320
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,100
So now you can explore
those controls easily

321
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,260
and deploy those if needed.

322
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,450
And then, again, auto enrollment accounts

323
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,850
is something that it was launched
a few weeks back as well.

324
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,130
This allows you to actually
migrate accounts easier

325
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,060
into Control Tower.

326
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,900
All those prerequisites

327
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,840
that sometimes it was a
blocker for some customers,

328
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,490
now they can actually do that easily

329
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,100
because the service actually
preparing the account

330
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,743
to be migrated into Control Tower.

331
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,530
And then finally, the
service-linked config rules.

332
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,000
As I mentioned, those integrations,

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,863
what this is doing is basically
I'm now, from Control Tower,

334
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,890
I can deploy config rules,

335
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,260
and I'm totally confident
that maybe somebody

336
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,580
with access to my member accounts,

337
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,140
even with permissions in Config,

338
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,160
they cannot touch those rules.

339
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,843
So those becoming mutable rules.

340
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,330
And he says, "Okay, all good."

341
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,610
But then now I have three services,

342
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,780
and a lot of our services

343
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,340
maybe even underlying Control Tower,

344
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,810
and we just saw only three,

345
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,940
and we saw that there
were a lot of updates

346
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,773
on each one of them.

347
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:54,510
So how can I actually keep
the pace on these things?

348
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,090
So this is when generative
AI actually comes in handy.

349
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,330
And the main service that we're
gonna explore today is Kiro.

350
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,900
Kiro is a conversional assistant
powered by AI, of course,

351
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,940
that is helping developers
and IT professionals

352
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,870
to write code, run test
on what you're doing,

353
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,820
access to AWS APIs.

354
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,020
And this is when we start looking

355
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,680
at how we can embed Kiro into AWS, right,

356
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,210
into my AWS environment.

357
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,570
So I can install Kiro in my AWS CLI,

358
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,390
and I can actually take context
and actually deploy commands

359
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,550
and do those centrally from my terminal,

360
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,620
or even from CloudTrail in AWS.

361
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,770
I can deploy code and I
can connect to MCP servers,

362
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,500
and deploy agents in those MCP servers.

363
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,410
So it comes with also with the
capabilities of agentic AI.

364
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,745
You can have rationalization

365
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:41,812
in those natural language conversations

366
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:44,670
with the agent to come up
with a strategy, right?

367
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,510
And that's sort of the things

368
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,180
that definitely it's something
that it can take a look on.

369
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,050
And then he realized

370
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,290
that AWS also provides
managed MCP servers, right?

371
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,370
So this is the capability

372
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,950
for you to don't be worried
about the standardization,

373
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,320
how many IPIs are actually in the backend.

374
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,820
CloudTrail is a good example of this.

375
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,490
They also launch and CloudTrail MCP server

376
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,990
that allows you to even run queries

377
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,330
without actually knowing
how to run those queries.

378
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,830
So you can actually
just have a conversation

379
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,870
to run investigations
using these kind of things.

380
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,170
And then you can leverage
knowledge MCP servers from AWS

381
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,170
to actually start doing
all the cool stuff,

382
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,100
the real cool stuff.

383
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,320
And that's when I'm
gonna move back to Pal,

384
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,937
that she's gonna explain
actually how to do all this

385
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:23,103
and how can she automate her husband.

386
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,213
- So it is the demo time.

387
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,100
Now, before we move on to the demo,

388
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,120
I quickly wanna share the
current test environment

389
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,440
that Nita's team built

390
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,470
for exploring these
generative AI capabilities

391
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,450
for accelerating governance.

392
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,240
So on the top you have
the management account.

393
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,000
It is a standard Control
Tower landing zone

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,390
that I have built on behalf of Nita,

395
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,030
and it has five organization units

396
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,250
that you can see on the right-hand side,

397
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,650
and it has about 18 accounts,

398
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,770
And for the most of the
demos that I have prepared,

399
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,830
we will be deploying it over the Labs OU.

400
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,240
And then on the bottom part,

401
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,720
you can see some of the shared
services, standard accounts,

402
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,510
log archive, and audit
accounts that come up

403
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,693
when you build landing zone
with the Control Tower.

404
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,990
So, with that, we are going
to really start simple

405
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,060
and with foundational rules,

406
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,730
that is how to create an
organization config rule.

407
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,660
And for all the...

408
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,550
I have prepared three demos in total.

409
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,420
And for all three,

410
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,830
I'm going to use Kiro CLI that
Bob introduced to my team.

411
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,600
So give me a sec here

412
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,303
to quickly change to my demo environment.

413
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,603
So I am starting here
with the Kiro CLI chat.

414
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:02,610
This is a default chat without passing in,

415
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,230
that comes up when you do not pass

416
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,010
any of the additional
arguments to Kiro CLI.

417
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,520
And I have loaded a
single MCP server here,

418
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,570
and that server is called
AWS MCP core server.

419
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,970
This is a really good server

420
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,450
to get started on using AWS MCP servers

421
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,240
because it utilizes dynamic proxy

422
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,603
to import other group of
servers based on roles.

423
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,560
Let's take a look what I mean.

424
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,560
So this is the MCP config
file that I've configured.

425
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,930
And you can see that I have
provided two roles here,

426
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,240
solutions architect and foundation.

427
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,970
Both of these roles are
like logical groupings

428
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,360
of MCP servers that are
commonly used together

429
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,860
for a specific use case.

430
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,990
So solutions architect role here,

431
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,257
it provides me access to MCP
servers such as knowledge,

432
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:59,610
AWS APIs, pricing, cost
explorer, et cetera.

433
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,610
While foundation, it gives
me access to knowledge,

434
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,283
as well as AWS API, MCP server.

435
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,450
Next, let's explore some of the tools

436
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,390
that come up with some
of these MCP servers.

437
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,520
An interesting one here

438
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,780
that core MCP server provides
this prompt understanding.

439
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,160
This tool really helps you

440
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,560
when you are designing AWS solutions

441
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,390
and using natural language to do it

442
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,749
because it really helps
translating your intent

443
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:34,440
in terms of what it means
and which services to utilize

444
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,243
and features and such.

445
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,610
Moving on, I have also
utilized knowledge base here.

446
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,680
So I have loaded the knowledge

447
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,550
about custom configures from AWS GitHub

448
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,780
into my knowledge base.

449
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,010
So knowledge command here,

450
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,580
it's like an experimental
feature on Kiro CLI right now

451
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,660
that helps you,

452
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,000
once you enable it, that
helps you store, search,

453
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,810
and manage additional
context across chat session.

454
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,750
And I have used best indexing type here

455
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,180
to index the knowledge base,

456
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,840
so that agent can do an
intelligent or a semantic search

457
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,683
against my knowledge base
whenever it requires to use that.

458
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,590
With that, I will move on

459
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,700
to create a basic organization config rule

460
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,160
that helps me detect EC2 instances

461
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,190
launched with public IP
address in my account.

462
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,930
And I'm asking the agent
to create the first fine,

463
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,858
if a managed config rule exists
for the similar use case.

464
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,410
If not, then go to the custom building,

465
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,270
the custom configure for that.

466
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,920
And also utilize knowledge
base in case it requires.

467
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,160
And finally use infrastructure
as code best practices.

468
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,600
So every action that it takes,

469
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,033
it can be traced back and audited.

470
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,220
So now, let's look

471
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,140
as the agent searches through
the knowledge base MCP server

472
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,260
to search through AWS documentation.

473
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,620
Then, for each of the tools here,

474
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,020
it is actually asking me for a permission

475
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,423
because I have not
trusted any of the tools.

476
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,810
But with t, I'm trusting all the tools

477
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,010
that are coming up

478
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,503
for the rest of the
duration of this session.

479
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,713
So let's watch it.

480
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,760
The agent also go,

481
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,400
went through the knowledge base

482
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,620
just to load the additional context

483
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,800
for custom rules in case it needs it.

484
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,550
It makes API calls to
my current environment

485
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,210
to find that there are no similar rules

486
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,483
already running in my account
to avoid any duplication.

487
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,170
And good news,

488
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,700
agent has found the
managed config rule for us,

489
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,213
and it is called
ec2-instance-no-public-ip.

490
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,213
Now,

491
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,340
next, you will see

492
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,880
that it'll create the required
CloudFormation templates

493
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,713
and files.

494
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:09,840
It'll create so in your
current working directory,

495
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,830
if you have not provided
any additional settings

496
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,840
in the config file.

497
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,290
And so it is utilizing my
current working directory.

498
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,510
It created...

499
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,740
Looking at the summary,

500
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,930
it created a CloudFormation template

501
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,630
for deploying the config rule.

502
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,700
It created a shell script

503
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,730
that will actually create
the CloudFormation stack,

504
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,320
and then a read me file.

505
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,270
So I reviewed the shell script,

506
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,790
and now I am going to
run that shell script

507
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,160
from within the session.

508
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,150
And you can do so

509
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,813
by proceeding your command
with an exclamation mark.

510
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,370
Looks like the deployment failed,

511
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,840
and this is where the fund begins

512
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,030
because now I can just ask Kiro CLI

513
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,640
to troubleshoot the issue for me

514
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,270
instead of me having to
go through multiple events

515
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,970
in the CloudTrail and correlate them.

516
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,970
So it quickly went through the
CloudFormation stack events,

517
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,423
it found the issue, and
it deleted the stack.

518
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,690
The issue is regarding the resource type

519
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,460
for the organization config rule

520
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,495
as it does not support rule ARN.

521
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:29,430
Instead, it returns rule name.

522
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,530
So you can see it making changes.

523
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,790
Whichever lines are in red,

524
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,470
it remove that from the template,

525
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,513
versus green is the addition.

526
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,580
So now it is waiting
for the stack to delete

527
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,323
before redeploying it.

528
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,980
It redeployed again.

529
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,040
And this time, you can notice
that it didn't wait for me

530
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,050
to explicitly tell him to troubleshoot,

531
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,400
or tell it to troubleshoot,

532
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,260
and instead, went ahead.

533
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,023
And again, the stack seems to have failed.

534
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,470
This time, the issue is
related to frequency parameter.

535
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,250
The ec2-no-public-ip config
rule is triggered by change.

536
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,730
So frequency is not a valid
parameter for this rule.

537
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,770
It quickly identifies the issue.

538
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,143
And it follows the same sequence,

539
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,410
deletes the stack, waits for the deletion,

540
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,033
and deploys the stack again,

541
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,610
Yay!

542
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,750
Third time was the charm,

543
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,120
and we have a successful stack deployment.

544
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,150
And hence, a successful deployment

545
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,163
of organization config rule.

546
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,450
It'll also provide the summary

547
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,670
of all the steps that it went through,

548
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,670
so all the issues that it found

549
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,430
And the resolution that it applied.

550
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,280
For the next part, I'm going to query.

551
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,740
So I have a config aggregator,

552
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,980
which is like you can
aggregate all the config events

553
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,310
from all your AWS accounts
in the organization

554
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,600
into a single account.

555
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,130
So I already have that deployed

556
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,570
by Control Tower in my audit
account that we previously saw.

557
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,550
And I'm using that to query
for the non-compliant instances

558
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,900
that were found

559
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,570
in respect to the rule
that we just deployed.

560
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,730
And we found three instances

561
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,483
across two AWS accounts that we can see.

562
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,030
So this kind of shows us how
easy it was for Nita's team

563
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,640
to do the research, do the deployment,

564
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,040
and even run the query for non-compliance,

565
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,050
all from within a single session,

566
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,063
without having to leave terminal.

567
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,463
With that, let me move on to my next demo.

568
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
So, with this, we are going to use agent

569
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,110
to implement shift left
strategy for controls.

570
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,090
So let's talk about shift left.

571
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,450
So, traditionally, compliance
and security controls

572
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,350
have had been added late in
the deployment lifecycle,

573
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,590
and sometimes the fixes,
it becomes costly,

574
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,920
it causes delay and also gaps in security.

575
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,910
So shift left,

576
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,720
it literally means
shifting left your controls

577
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,590
in the development lifecycle,

578
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,430
so you can detect the issues
earlier on and fix them

579
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,310
and not having to fix them later.

580
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,760
And what that means in
terms of AWS infrastructure

581
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,620
or what that means for Nita's team

582
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,760
is she's going to implement
two types of controls,

583
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,780
preventive controls,

584
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,600
which are powered by
service control policies

585
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,060
and apply it on organization,

586
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,100
and second is proactive controls,

587
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,160
which are powered by
CloudFormation Guard Hook

588
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,740
that can actually detect non-compliance

589
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,900
in your infrastructure templates

590
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,100
and block it

591
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,343
even before having to go
through the deployment.

592
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,800
So in this demo,

593
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,930
I will show you how Kiro helps implement

594
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,907
both the preventive,

595
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:01,140
as well as proactive controls,

596
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,960
and making it easier to
catch and stop issues

597
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,733
before they reach production.

598
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,630
So let me switch to my
demo environment again.

599
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,270
This time, instead of
using a default agent,

600
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,330
I created a new agent called
shift-left-specialist.

601
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,730
In the agent config file,

602
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,340
I defined such that the agent

603
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,370
is a special security architect,

604
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,370
and its expertise is to kind
of define or create shift left,

605
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,170
equivalent shift left controls
of a given config rule

606
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,240
or a given detective rule

607
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,640
in terms of both the preventive controls

608
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,830
as well as the proactive controls.

609
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,910
And for this agent, I
loaded to MCP servers.

610
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,083
I'm starting simple.

611
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,720
Oops.

612
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,783
Yeah, it's knowledge as well as API.

613
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,690
Now we do have AWS CLI tool

614
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,530
inside the Kiro CLI that
comes in by default.

615
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,990
So Kiro CLI can interact and call,

616
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,410
make AWS CLI calls to your infrastructure.

617
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,180
But I like to add API MCP

618
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,983
because I have noticed in all
the tests that it makes for,

619
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,820
or it quickly generates accurate API

620
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,530
or accurate CLI command

621
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,930
without doing many retries with the syntax

622
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,483
and the parameters that are supported.

623
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,670
So, moving on, let's
take a look at context.

624
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,760
So this time, I've
added an additional file

625
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,010
called shift-lift-bp-guide.

626
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,140
This is a context file

627
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,020
that provides some extra
information to the agent

628
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,719
about what is shift left,

629
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:59,250
how to author the preventive

630
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,550
as well as proactive controls on AWS.

631
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,310
And this is different
from the knowledge base.

632
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,200
It is simply increasing the context.

633
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
It's not something that
agent would search.

634
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,353
It's not indexed.

635
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,210
And this time,

636
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,240
you would see that there are
much less number of tools

637
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
than before because I have
just two MCP server loaded.

638
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,430
And on the permission,

639
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,280
you would also see that I've
pret trusted some of the tools

640
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,920
that I knew were going to get
used throughout this session,

641
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,730
like reading the files, calling AWS APIs.

642
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,980
And from knowledge MCP,

643
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,353
we have read and search
through the AWS documentation.

644
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,570
Now, the first part of shifting

645
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,890
or implementing shift left

646
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,540
is to identify what
non-compliant resources you have

647
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,800
through detective controls.

648
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,320
And that is what I'm asking it to do here

649
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,890
is to query the top two
non-compliant config rules

650
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,803
with most number of
non-compliant resources.

651
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,030
So let's watch as the agent again

652
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,320
knows to query the config
aggregator in my account,

653
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,340
it describes the rules
within the config aggregator,

654
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,720
think some more.

655
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,190
And based on the data it
collected, it gave me two rules.

656
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,613
So we have one is KMS tagged key.

657
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,730
This control really detects
which KMS keys are not tagged.

658
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,823
And the second control is
which lambda functions,

659
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,720
or production lambda
functions for not deployed

660
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,463
with X-Ray tracing enabled.

661
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,803
So now that we have that information,

662
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,670
I'm using editor command here

663
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,400
to provide somewhat of a longer prompt

664
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,283
that I already had prebuilt on the side.

665
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,194
And so by default, it opens a vi editor,

666
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:01,413
but you can set the editor
of your choice if you want.

667
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,660
And here, I am asking it to
develop the shift left controls.

668
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,910
And I'm specifically asking it

669
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,520
to deploy this through customization

670
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,180
for Control Tower
Pipeline, or CfCT solution.

671
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,220
If you're familiar with that solution,

672
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,250
it's, like, lets you
customize your AWS accounts

673
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,650
after they get provisioned
through Control Tower.

674
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,890
And I'm saying that for
the KMS config rule,

675
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,100
it should create a service control policy,

676
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,510
and only do it for the KMS keys

677
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,910
with cost and environment tags

678
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,700
and apply it on overall organization

679
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,530
that is just for simplicity.

680
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,990
For the lambda config rule,

681
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,810
I want to create a
CloudFormation Guard Hook

682
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,840
that will prevent the
non-compliant lambdas

683
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,820
to get created in the first place.

684
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,520
And I only want to deploy this control

685
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,520
on a specific organization
unit of my overall org.

686
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,940
So now, it has access
to my CfCT manifest file

687
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,100
through the current working directory.

688
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,000
And as the agent creates
and updates the files,

689
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm going to shift through some of these

690
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,910
and get us through the part

691
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,990
where we can see the git summary

692
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,090
for what changes were implemented.

693
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,353
So I'll pause here.

694
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,390
And here, you would see
what were the changes

695
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,100
that were made by the agent.

696
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,750
And some files were changed,

697
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,720
while some were deleted and added.

698
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,720
This is because we were not successful

699
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,870
to deploy the controls in the first run.

700
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,030
So I had some troubleshooting

701
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,730
that I had to skip for in
the interest of time here.

702
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,460
But I'll just give you brief
summary of what happened.

703
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,660
So while it was very smooth
in creating the right SCP

704
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,370
for the KMS control,

705
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,370
like detecting which
KMS keys are not tagged,

706
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,630
it had some challenges

707
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,240
to create the CloudFormation Guard Hook.

708
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,500
And one of the challenge was
so CloudFormation Guard Hook,

709
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,823
it evaluates your,

710
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:17,310
it can evaluate your entire stack

711
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,710
and then decide whether
it should let the stack

712
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,990
to go ahead with the deployment or not.

713
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,200
And since I am creating
the hook with the stack,

714
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,580
I don't want that hook

715
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,300
to run against the stack that created it.

716
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,070
It's like a chicken and egg problem.

717
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,640
Now we do have a parameter in
the CloudFormation resource

718
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,820
to skip the tag from running,

719
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,490
or from getting evaluated by the hook,

720
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,490
and the agent required some back and forth

721
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,900
for it to find the exact parameter.

722
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,520
It's like a niche skill or parameter

723
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,920
that not everyone might know.

724
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,370
But I did not just feed that
information to the agent.

725
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,330
Instead, I asked it to go
through the public documentation

726
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,740
and through knowledge MCP server,

727
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,561
it has access to AWS docs, blogs,

728
00:34:07,561 --> 00:34:10,950
as well as what's new
information, what's new posts.

729
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,440
So it was able to find that information

730
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,423
through a blog post that we have.

731
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,643
And now, here is the summary
of the commit that it'll make.

732
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,520
So here, I'm just again
running the command

733
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,200
to push the commit.

734
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,413
I didn't want agent to do it on this run.

735
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,320
And this, in the backend,
has started our pipeline,

736
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,200
or code pipeline for the customization

737
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,823
for Control Tower solution.

738
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,010
Again, I'm going to check on
the status of the code pipeline

739
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,143
that was triggered with this git push.

740
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,293
Let's see.

741
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,570
So now it knows the
exact API calls to make,

742
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,940
it lists the code pipeline
that I have available,

743
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,120
it lists the execution
of the given pipeline,

744
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,050
and also get the details
of the recent execution

745
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,150
or the most latest execution.

746
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,850
And it gives us the
status of the pipeline,

747
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,713
which is currently in progress.

748
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,550
So I waited for some time

749
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,370
for the pipeline deployment
to complete on the side

750
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,923
and check the status
of the pipeline again.

751
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,930
Again, it runs the same
command to list the pipeline.

752
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,540
And it shows us that the
pipeline has succeeded.

753
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,510
It has succeeded in all
the stages that it has.

754
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,133
Its total of six stages.

755
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,270
Now, from the same session,

756
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,820
I'm going to validate one of the controls,

757
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,660
which is CloudFormation
lambda hook, or Guard Hook,

758
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,020
that it created for
preventing lambda functions

759
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,233
or non-compliant lambda
functions from being created.

760
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,950
And so remember in the beginning

761
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,850
that I asked to deploy these
CloudFormation Guard Hook

762
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,440
only on the Labs OU, and the
Labs OU has two accounts.

763
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,610
And so it shows one of the
accounts to run that test.

764
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,520
But when I started this session,

765
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,090
I provided the credentials
for my management account

766
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,830
of my organization,

767
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,690
and so it quickly realizes

768
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,990
that it doesn't have access
to the member account.

769
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,500
So at this stage, I will ask the agent

770
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,810
to assume the Control Tower execution role

771
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,140
in one of these member
accounts and then tested.

772
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,910
Now I had to skip through the part

773
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,530
where it shows the entire test

774
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,820
because it prints the AWS
credentials on the screen,

775
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,610
which I did not want to
share for security reason.

776
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,170
So I'm just going to ask it

777
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,360
to print the results
of the validation test

778
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,660
that it performed instead.

779
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:58,380
And so that's the test environment,

780
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,650
one of the accounts in the
Labs OU you can see at the top.

781
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,570
And it created two tests,

782
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,610
one for the compliant lambda function

783
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,620
and one for the non-compliant.

784
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,450
In the compliant one,

785
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,870
the lambda function had
X-Ray tracing enabled,

786
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,410
as well as it was tagged with
the production environment key

787
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,070
that I'd passed in the original prompt,

788
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,483
and that was successful.

789
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,993
While for the non-compliant test,

790
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,220
we have the tag again, but it
was missing the X-Ray tracing.

791
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,760
So this deployment was blocked
by CloudFormation hook.

792
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,830
And that concludes my second demo.

793
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,787
And again, even this shows how
easy it was for Nita's team

794
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:48,990
to test the shift left
strategy for implementing

795
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,190
and how easily they can scale
across 300 plus accounts

796
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,990
that they have in their environment.

797
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,670
I'm going to shift

798
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,470
to our next and final demo of the session,

799
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,920
which is, again, I'm going
to use this same agent

800
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,110
to create an AWS account

801
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,590
and deploy SRA aligned patching solution.

802
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,300
So for those of you who may not know,

803
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,600
SRA is like a security
reference architecture.

804
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,570
It's like holistic
guideline that AWS provides

805
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,187
to implement, like, complete
set of security services

806
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:29,640
that we have following AWS best practices.

807
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,300
It has the whole GitHub
repository for this.

808
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,790
And so today, for this demo,

809
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,810
I'll use Kiro CLI to do two tasks.

810
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,330
One is to create an AWS account

811
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,640
and then deploy the SRA
align patching solution

812
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,780
on one of the existing accounts.

813
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,820
Actually, I'm doing it
on the Labs OU again,

814
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,890
just for simplicity.

815
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,600
So this is the architecture

816
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,440
of the SRA align patching
solution from the GitHub.

817
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,230
And you can see that it uses Patch Manager

818
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,560
from Systems Manager along
with maintenance window

819
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,560
to run these appropriate
baselines and patch the instances.

820
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,460
So let's see how our agent

821
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,150
is able to interpret this
solution that I will feed

822
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,813
and implement the design
through CfCT code pipeline.

823
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:22,563
Oops, no, I want to switch.

824
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,673
So let me switch to my
third and final demo.

825
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,160
Again, we created,

826
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
I created a new agent
called create-AWS-account,

827
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,270
which specializes in
provisioning an AWS account

828
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,760
and also apply account customization.

829
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,120
Here, I've loaded three MCP servers.

830
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,520
Now, let's look at the knowledge base.

831
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,520
So I have added the
entire GitHub repository

832
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:08,640
of security reference
architecture in my knowledge base,

833
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,730
and again indexed it with best type,

834
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,963
so that agent can do an
intelligent search against this.

835
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,080
Let's look at the context.

836
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,150
So I've also added an additional file

837
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,170
about what are the general
foundational best practices

838
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,403
for account customization,
et cetera, in my context.

839
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:34,710
And you can also see

840
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,470
the percentage of context window it used.

841
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,493
It's not much.

842
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,973
So...

843
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm going to use editor command,

844
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,540
and I will provide all
the required parameters

845
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,910
for creating an AWS account.

846
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,170
It's the usual one, email address, the OU,

847
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,573
organization account name, et cetera.

848
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,260
And let's watch as the agent.

849
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,790
So agent exactly knew

850
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,370
which method to create the account with,

851
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,340
which was to use service catalog product

852
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,550
that Control Tower already provides you

853
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,883
once you create your landing
zone with Control Tower.

854
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,600
So it searches my available products,

855
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,753
it searches the product
that Control Tower created.

856
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,180
It also finds the provisioning parameters

857
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,640
that are required for
deploying this product

858
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,260
through service catalog,

859
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,720
and then verifies if I have provided

860
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,273
all the parameters in my prompt.

861
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,340
So this line is important.

862
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,247
This is a heavy change that
will create an AWS account.

863
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:54,930
How did the agent determine
this is because I've defined

864
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,480
what a heavy change is in my context file

865
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,150
that I initially fed to my agent.

866
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,360
And so before making any
of the heavy changes,

867
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,810
I want the agent to ask
for my confirmation,

868
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,850
and that is what it exactly did.

869
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,470
And once I confirm,

870
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,950
it goes ahead to create
the service catalog product

871
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,863
that will provision
the AWS account for us.

872
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,513
I'm just going to check on the status

873
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:26,163
of the latest account that was created.

874
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,203
And here's the account
we have, really simple.

875
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,050
So for the next part,

876
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,800
now we are going to
apply the customization,

877
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,480
the SRA align patching solution
that we previously saw.

878
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,410
And for that, I'm asking agent to take,

879
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,910
again, it has the context

880
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,440
about my current working
directory, my CfCT solution,

881
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,410
my pipeline, and the SRA solu,

882
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,590
sorry, security reference
architecture documentation,

883
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:05,850
or the GitHub repo that I fed
in through the knowledge base.

884
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,510
So you can see how it searches
through different things.

885
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:13,080
It goes through my
current working directory

886
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,970
to find the manifest file.

887
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,500
It understands that.

888
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,490
Then it searches the knowledge base

889
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,410
for the reference architecture
and finds relevant,

890
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,750
tries to find the relevant components

891
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,430
of the patching solution

892
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,043
to design the patching
solution that I asked for.

893
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,470
And looking at the deployment
plan that it provides,

894
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,570
it provides the current
state architecture,

895
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:41,490
the existing ones, existing
resources that I already have,

896
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,800
and the future state architecture.

897
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,260
And for the future state,

898
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,650
it provides me with two
CloudFormation templates

899
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,680
that is going to deploy
my patching solution.

900
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,930
One is the prerequisite template

901
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:59,400
that has the prerequisite
for creating the baselines

902
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,770
or the maintenance window, et cetera,

903
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,140
and second is the main solution

904
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,350
that will actually deploy
the maintenance window.

905
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,840
So here, we have three maintenance window.

906
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,110
One is going to update the SSM agent

907
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,540
that is required for the patching.

908
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,420
Second is run the maintenance for,

909
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,033
sorry, run the patching for Windows.

910
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,523
And third is random patching
for Linux instances.

911
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:27,480
We can also take a look

912
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,210
at some of the key
configuration parameters,

913
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,630
like, what is the schedule
of my maintenance window?

914
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,950
Do I want to run the
patching in the install mode

915
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,363
or the scan mode?

916
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,850
And I have not provided
any of this to the agent.

917
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,680
All I have done is provided the prompt

918
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,130
that we saw in the beginning.

919
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,930
So it identified some
of the key parameters

920
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,333
that needs confirmation from me.

921
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,580
One is I did not mention
where to deploy the solution.

922
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,430
So it is confirming if it
should start with the Labs OU

923
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,040
because it has knowledge of my environment

924
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,550
It picked the Labs OU
based on the name, I guess.

925
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,490
It asks whether I want
to patch in the scan mode

926
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,831
or directly go to the install mode.

927
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,390
Are the schedules okay?

928
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,390
Do I have EC2 instances already tagged?

929
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,090
And I'm going to provide all answers

930
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,563
to all the questions here.

931
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,250
Sorry for the text, it is at the bottom,

932
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,133
but I couldn't scroll it at that point.

933
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,210
So now, now that it has confirmation,

934
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,940
it moves on to create the
CloudFormation templates

935
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,013
and all the other required files.

936
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,890
Let me skip us some of this

937
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,110
and get us through the git summary,

938
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,303
so that we can look at the changes.

939
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:05,030
So we saw that it created
two CloudFormation templates,

940
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,100
one for the prerequisites,
one is the main solution,

941
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,260
this is the manifest file which controls

942
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,010
where the CloudFormation
stack sets would be deployed,

943
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,320
which is Labs OU only.

944
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,500
And then it also provides
me with a markdown file

945
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,100
of what all the changes it did and how.

946
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,610
So I'm going to ask it
to commit the changes,

947
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,583
which will trigger our code
pipeline in the backend.

948
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:36,180
And this time, it already had
the command to do a git push.

949
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,743
So when I asked it to commit,

950
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:41,133
it also pushed the
commit to my repository.

951
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,160
So we are going to check

952
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,623
on the status of the code pipeline again.

953
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,970
It'll go through the
same sequence of events,

954
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,580
describing the pipeline,
the latest execution,

955
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,923
and getting the details for us.

956
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,610
So, currently, the pipeline is in progress

957
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,030
at the second stage,
which is the build stage.

958
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,410
Now, for this one, while I
was waiting for the demo,

959
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,010
I decided to experiment
with the tangent mode.

960
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,150
So tangent mode,

961
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,910
it kind of allows you to
have a side conversation

962
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:18,810
without spoiling the context
of your current environment

963
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,823
or whatever current session you have.

964
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:23,460
So here, I'm just asking it,

965
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,130
what are the some of
the top feature launches

966
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,200
at 2025 re:Invent,

967
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,070
specifically for organizations
and Control Tower services.

968
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:32,903
And you can see,

969
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:35,700
it searches through AWS documentation

970
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,010
using different set of keywords.

971
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,100
It also searches through the
what's new post and blog post

972
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,140
because we do announcements

973
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,420
through all these different channels.

974
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,280
And based on the search,

975
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,440
it provided a list of couple things.

976
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,510
Actually there were more in organizations,

977
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,060
like direct account transfer
and transfer billing.

978
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,680
You can see some of the announcement

979
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,920
that Rodolfo also spoke
about for Control Tower,

980
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,550
which is controls-only dedicated
experience, more rules,

981
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,563
more compliance frameworks, et cetera.

982
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,170
Now that we are done having fun,

983
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,390
let's get out of the tangent mode

984
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,173
and head back to check on
the status of our pipeline.

985
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,370
It makes the same CLI calls again.

986
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:27,573
And looks like we have a
successful pipeline deployment.

987
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,350
This was a really smooth experience.

988
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,860
Again, this shows how easy it
was for Nita's team to test.

989
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,500
Like sometimes, these
account customizations,

990
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,780
they get really complex.

991
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,990
And when it's, I mean, even for human,

992
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,260
it's kind of not every human would have

993
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,730
all the context necessary,

994
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,970
but it's easier to feed
like such large context

995
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,940
and knowledge base to
the agent and train it.

996
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,850
And we also saw that their team,

997
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,510
they kind of utilize these
specialized agents instead.

998
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,533
So having the agents do very
specific dedicated task.

999
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,680
And that's why they got great results.

1000
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,113
So I also have one more demo here.

1001
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,833
Let me switch.

1002
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,960
I promise this is the last one.

1003
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,460
It is just a validation of
what the agent deployed.

1004
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,460
So now, I am in the management
account of my Control Tower

1005
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,140
in the console,

1006
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,200
and I'm going through the CloudFormation,

1007
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,170
just to show you the stack
sets that it deployed.

1008
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,300
So remember how we saw two stacks

1009
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,650
that the agent provided us
for the patching solution.

1010
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:47,010
One was the prerequisites,
other was the main solution.

1011
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,410
So these are those two stack sets

1012
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,870
that were created through the pipeline.

1013
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,840
Let's go into one of these stack sets

1014
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,030
and take a look that this was deployed

1015
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,123
into two of our accounts,
which are under Labs OU.

1016
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,740
And I'm going to log into one of the OUs,

1017
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,920
one of the accounts that
I'm highlighting here.

1018
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,420
So this is that account.

1019
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,503
Again, I'm in the
CloudFormation stack window.

1020
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,380
This is the stack it created.

1021
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,270
And take a look at the timestamp.

1022
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,550
If you noticed it in my last demo,

1023
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,240
it should match with the
execution time of our pipeline,

1024
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,010
just to confirm that these stacks

1025
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,160
are actually from the that build.

1026
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,960
So now, I am into the
Systems Manager console,

1027
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,800
where I'm showing the three
maintenance window that we saw,

1028
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,120
each for doing Linux
patching, Windows patching,

1029
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,613
and just updating the SSM agents.

1030
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,070
So let me get into the detail
of one of those windows,

1031
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,513
which is for Linux.

1032
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,540
I'll head into the task to
see actually what it created.

1033
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,840
So it shows the default patch base,

1034
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,233
sorry, default document
to run the patch baseline.

1035
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,880
And then towards the bottom,

1036
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,940
we will see the operations
type, which is Scan.

1037
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,940
This is what I had prompted
in my earlier demo.

1038
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,903
Oops, sorry,

1039
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,630
I kind of...

1040
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,550
Okay.

1041
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,490
Next up, I just quickly
go into the targets.

1042
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,940
So it selected the instance tags,

1043
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,930
selected to specify, or select
instances based on the tags.

1044
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,040
And these were the tags

1045
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,030
that we had earlier
confirmed in our prompt.

1046
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,610
And finally, this is the execution.

1047
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,520
So if you remember, the schedule
of the maintenance window,

1048
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,943
this is one of the last
executions that ran successfully.

1049
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:13,962
Okay.

1050
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:21,180
So that concludes the
end of all of my demos.

1051
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,130
Now...

1052
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,563
Oops.

1053
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,423
Yeah.

1054
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:29,670
So here are some additional
resources for you to review

1055
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,180
before I summarize our
journey, or Nita's journey.

1056
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,070
So first, you have cloud governance,

1057
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,050
recent launches, and resources.

1058
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,940
Second is Kiro CLI docs.

1059
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,380
These are great docs

1060
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,200
to get you started with
how to install Kiro CLI

1061
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,140
and utilize all the niche commands

1062
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,390
and the tools that it supports.

1063
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,930
And last one is the AWS MCP Server GitHub,

1064
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:56,100
which is where we publish MCP
servers for all the services,

1065
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,800
or the CloudTrail one
that had also mentioned,

1066
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,803
as well as all the other ones
that I utilized in my demo.

1067
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,830
Now, to summarize Nita's journey,

1068
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:11,070
like, if you think back why
they were successful was,

1069
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,750
as I was talking earlier,

1070
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,990
like, they utilized the agent's various,

1071
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,880
for niche use cases,

1072
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,600
they provided as much
context that was available.

1073
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,730
They provided good examples

1074
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,790
for each of the tasks
that wanted to implement.

1075
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,193
And that is why it was
successful for them.

1076
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,270
And more importantly, they started small,

1077
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,000
like really simple from
a simple config rule

1078
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,690
to deploying a complex
account customization.

1079
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,830
And with each test,

1080
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,110
it kind of built trust with their team

1081
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:47,280
in how generative AI can help
accelerate the governance,

1082
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,650
as well as controls for them.

1083
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:52,740
So just start small,
think big, and scale fast,

1084
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,380
and you can leverage Kiro CLI today

1085
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,440
to accelerate the governance,
as well as controls.

1086
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,470
And gen AI isn't just a tool.

1087
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:06,090
It can really help you, like,
work smarter, not harder,

1088
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,063
or at least it has helped
me a lot in my role.

1089
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,810
Before you leave,

1090
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,980

and then you can have
more deeper conversations

1092
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,380

00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,030
There, we have experts

1094
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,310
that can also give you one-on-one demos

1095
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,040
for all the cloud
governance-related services

1096
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,740
and recent launches.

1097
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,960
And also we have swags
and stickers for you,

1098

Thanks.
