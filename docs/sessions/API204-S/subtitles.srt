00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:03,660
Hey everyone, I'm uh Rahul Dareja from Mortado,

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,110
and today we'll be talking about

3
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:07,509
how to get your AI agents from the promise

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,589
that they have to actual real

5
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,728
impact. So today

6
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:14,050
we'll be covering the fact that AI

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,129
is definitely powerful, but there's something

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,989
lacking. We'll talk about

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,449
how orchestration is that silent force

10
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,370
that really makes your AI agents smart,

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,809
and then we'll close out with how Vortado's

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,888
point of view, you know, how do we look at how

13
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,989
Vortado can make your AI agents a lot smarter.

14
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:32,000
So, you know, I bring this up everywhere, right?

15
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,250
You know, you know, AI

16
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,639
has been

17
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,899
the, has been the term,

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,700
you know, for the past few years.

19
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:41,200
Everybody has their own interpretation. Everybody

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,319
thinks, you know, you know, AI in very different

21
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:43,868
ways,

22
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,348
but if you take a closer look, AI

23
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:49,000
is essentially is this layering

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,240
of orchestration with agentic,

25
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,404
right? You have these. Agents that can

26
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:55,603
really help you perform these front end tasks

27
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,465
really well where they can take

28
00:00:57,884 --> 00:00:59,884
actions for you, you know, they can go

29
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:02,125
ahead and and write emails for you, but

30
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,424
orchestration gives them that superpower

31
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,805
where they essentially allow you to work on your

32
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:08,963
enterprise applications they allow you

33
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:10,933
to perform actions as

34
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,245
creating a new order or, you know, you know, you

35
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:14,525
know, going ahead and,

36
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:16,924
you know, adding a new employee to your company.

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,489
So, you know, let's talk about.

38
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,549
Where we are in the AI journey right now, right?

39
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,730
So we know that AI is everywhere.

40
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:28,088
There are, there are companies who have onboarded, uh, AI

41
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,500
agents, you, you see the clouds, the,

42
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,079
the, the bedrocks, the Geminis everywhere,

43
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,620
but what you see is that they're being primarily

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,808
used for a lot of front-end

45
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:40,290
activities, right? People are using their AI agents

46
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,329
to essentially help them write

47
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,459
emails, to help them, you know, find

48
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:46,689
information, but what they're not really

49
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,790
doing is.

50
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,138
Acting upon your end applications,

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,278
the main power or or or the main

52
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,400
data lies in your end applications, the sales

53
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
forces, the SAPs, the Zendesk that

54
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,948
you have,

55
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,239
that's where your main data lies, but your AI is

56
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,459
not really able to act upon those applications.

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,829
So what's really missing, right? Your, your AI

58
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,659
agents are smart.

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,159
You have, they, they have the ability to

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,679
perform actions on your behalf,

61
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,479
but why aren't they able to do so?

62
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,508
And the answer to that.

63
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:15,969
Is

64
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,710
orchestration, right? So if, so

65
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:19,409
if you

66
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,879
really try to look at any AI agent or

67
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,990
if you really try to look at any enterprise company

68
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,399
who is looking to, you know, adopt AI

69
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,270
agents for them,

70
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,808
4 main things are of prime importance, right?

71
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,788
They essentially want

72
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,258
governed real-time access to their data.

73
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,550
They want process orchestration,

74
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,050
they essentially want a way to

75
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,330
define roles and escalation paths, and

76
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,330
they essentially want a continuous life cycle.

77
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,629
And all of that are the powers that

78
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:45,990
an orchestration engine can

79
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:47,088
can bring to you.

80
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:49,580
Combining AI with orchestration

81
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:51,409
gives you the combined power where

82
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,629
your AI agents now can essentially

83
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:55,669
act upon your data.

84
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:58,368
They can go ahead and interact with your end

85
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:00,669
applications, perform actions on your behalf.

86
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,990
So if you have to create a new sales order

87
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,189
or onboard a new employee, your

88
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,308
agent is now empowered to do this

89
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:08,550
with the ability to orchestrate.

90
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,330
Now, why does it matter for agents, right? It's,

91
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:15,179
you, so orchestration, you know, allows

92
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:17,300
you to connect your end applications. It

93
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,919
allows

94
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:21,020
application A to, to speak with Application

95
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,479
B, which essentially is very, very important

96
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,819
for, for agents, right? So if agents have to perform something,

97
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,159
they need to understand

98
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,460
what application do I need to connect to, where

99
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,500
do I extract my data from, where do I

100
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,300
write data to.

101
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,250
You want to implement guardrails, right?

102
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,868
You know, security and trust are

103
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:38,770
the number one

104
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:41,149
things that every enterprise looks at, right? They want

105
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:41,849
to make sure

106
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,308
that if they have an AI agent that they're using to

107
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,429
perform actions, it should be done in

108
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:48,069
a secure and trustworthy manner.

109
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,569
You should be able to use

110
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,669
all forms of authentication that are available

111
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,860
to essentially interact with and applications,

112
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,080
and your AI agent should comply with those.

113
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,099
This should be enable collaboration right now

114
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,538
the way we look at AI agents is

115
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,838
as an assistant to an employee, you

116
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:07,139
know, it, you know, it could help a salesperson

117
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,189
bring up deals that that have been dormant

118
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:10,939
for a long time.

119
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,979
It could help a customer service representative

120
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,678
answer questions in a way which can

121
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,660
solve customer issues a lot quicker.

122
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,139
It can, and your AI agent should be able

123
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,649
to.

124
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,470
Enable collaboration and it should

125
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,500
be able to hand over from a human to

126
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,689
an agent any time

127
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,129
and finally

128
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:31,750
leave a trace, right? You are having your agent

129
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,910
interact with your end applications

130
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,949
you want to make sure that you're able to leave

131
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,428
that paper trail of what's happening

132
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:39,290
behind the scenes.

133
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,449
And that's where

134
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,488
Orchestration comes in, right? So orchestration

135
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:46,588
is your silent force.

136
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:49,048
It's the force that's gonna enable your agents to

137
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:50,170
be a lot smarter.

138
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,449
It's the force that's gonna enable your agents to

139
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,338
essentially act upon your end applications

140
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,528
and make them more meaningful.

141
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:59,298
Now, let's try and look at it from a

142
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,028
business process perspective, right?

143
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,559
Every single enterprise customer, right, they

144
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:05,639
have multiple business processes.

145
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,079
Now, these could be my

146
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,199
order to cash, my

147
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,678
uh procure to pay, or any other

148
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,509
process that I have.

149
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,959
And at the bottom layer is where I have all

150
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,678
of my ends.

151
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:16,713
This is where

152
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,173
my data resides. These are my systems of

153
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:19,834
truth of data,

154
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:22,434
which could be my SAPs, my,

155
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,653
my Salesforce applications, my, or my

156
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:25,754
other ERPs.

157
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,213
On top of that,

158
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,653
you have your connectivity fabric. This is

159
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:31,814
how you essentially interact with these

160
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:32,394
applications.

161
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,375
Now, forward to today.

162
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,028
You already have your agentic layer, you already have

163
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,850
your agents that, that essentially are running,

164
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,019
and you want to,

165
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,588
and you essentially want your agents to perform actions

166
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:43,879
on your end applications.

167
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:45,480
What's the missing link?

168
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,230
It's the orchestration layer.

169
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,629
The authorization layer is the one that's going

170
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,548
to allow

171
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,988
interaction of your of your AI

172
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:55,160
agents with your underlying

173
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,488
applications, which also lets you enable

174
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,689
this deep action layer where your

175
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,269
agents can really perform

176
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:03,548
actions on your data. They can go

177
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:04,970
ahead and perform tasks

178
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,509
based on what you're trying to do, right? They can

179
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,838
mimic what's you know what a human can do,

180
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,189
and that's where their, their real power lies, and that's the

181
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,850
power that orchestration brings up.

182
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,069
Now, You know,

183
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,569
a lot of customers have already built

184
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,730
a lot of orchestrations, right? The, the, the whole

185
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,850
idea of orchestration and iPass is not

186
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,889
new, and there are customers who

187
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:27,389
have, who may have already built

188
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,309
hundreds of thousands of integrations

189
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,838
with AI

190
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,689
in the midst. They don't really want to rebuild

191
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,769
everything, right? They, they, they should be able to reuse what

192
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,088
they've already built, and this is an example

193
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,769
where. An AI app they've onboarded

194
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,149
and can now interact with your with your

195
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,410
pre-built integrations

196
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,738
through MCP, right? And MCP is, you

197
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:50,028
know, is a great example where it, it

198
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,088
can really enable your AI agents

199
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,730
to become a lot smarter

200
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:56,189
without having to put a lot of effort because you

201
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:58,369
already have built your. Registrations you've

202
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,829
made sure that that that

203
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,170
all of your integrations that you have built, they're they're

204
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,269
already using the right

205
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:06,160
security protocols they're interacting with the right

206
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,170
applications they're using the right accounts and

207
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,269
now you can put your AI agent through MCP

208
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,230
and essentially now

209
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,790
interact with your end applications and perform those

210
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,329
actions.

211
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,660
Now this is where, you know, I'd like to

212
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,738
talk about Vortado's approach, right? You

213
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,988
know, you, you know, with Vortado,

214
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,358
our goal was

215
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:24,730
to essentially help enable AI

216
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,778
agents to be a lot smarter for them

217
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,069
to go ahead and interact with their with the

218
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,309
end applications and to take actions on your behalf.

219
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,139
Wortado always started off as an.

220
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,744
Torate platform and we use the

221
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:37,983
power of our Orrate platform to layer

222
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,384
on Agentic on top of it.

223
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:41,824
With our Agentic platform, it, it uses

224
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,975
the underlying power of Orchestrate to interact

225
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:46,144
with our end applications and it can

226
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:48,264
allow you to have your AI agents

227
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:50,264
now interact with those end applications through

228
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,004
MCP.

229
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,785
And this is where I'd like to introduce to Wortado

230
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:54,963
one now

231
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,165
if, if you talk to any,

232
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:58,384
you know.

233
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,088
Any director or any VP

234
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,750
in any enterprise company for them,

235
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,588
these 3 facets are the most important

236
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,000
for their AI adoption journey.

237
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,399
Uh, they want access to the right knowledge,

238
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:11,269
which means that they want access to their

239
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,048
company documents.

240
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,309
They want, they want

241
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,910
orchestration because they want to make sure that it can

242
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:17,869
actually perform

243
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,069
actions on a, on a user's behalf,

244
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,410
and the number one thing is trust, right? They want to

245
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,410
make sure that all of this happens in a

246
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,809
layer of governance and in a layer of security.

247
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,189
And these are the three things which we kept in

248
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,399
mind when designing Vortado 1.

249
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,899
So with Vortado 1,

250
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,298
as you can see here, right, with Vortado 1, we,

251
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,548
we started off as an orchestrate

252
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,710
platform, which is, which is our, which

253
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,788
is an iPad iPass Plus, but then we

254
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,649
layered on top

255
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:45,308
our gentic platform which essentially allows

256
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,609
you to build your own agents or

257
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,009
leverage Vortado's Enterprise MCP

258
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,849
to go ahead and empower your existing agents

259
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,428
to take advantage of your existing, existing

260
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:56,330
orchestrations.

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,899
Now, you might ask me

262
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,379
that, do I need

263
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,979
to have Rotado Orchestrate to use Roortado Agenic?

264
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,590
The answer to that would be no, right? Because you

265
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,960
may have built your orchestrations in

266
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,428
any language, in, in any software,

267
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,840
and you would be able to use Roortado's MCP

268
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,599
to to enable those orchestrations,

269
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,000
you know, to be used with your AI agents

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,658
and interact with your end applications.

271
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:19,950
And that's where,

272
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,558
you know, you know, I add this, another layer

273
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:24,178
to my diagram earlier,

274
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:27,440
does does the Enterprise MCP, right? My enterprise MCP

275
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:29,719
allows my AI agents,

276
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,548
you know, to essentially interact with my end

277
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,558
applications, and now all of

278
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:35,580
my deterministic.

279
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,769
can now be done in a non-deterministic

280
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,629
way through the use of my AI agents,

281
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,090
and that's where the power of of of MCP

282
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,450
lies and that's where, and that's the power that Rotaro

283
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,029
is essentially

284
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,489
talking about the power of Rotaro's Enterprise

285
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,808
MCP which allows you to interact with these

286
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:53,099
applications. Now talking about our enterprise

287
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:53,609
MCP.

288
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,408
With an enterprise MCP, right, the idea was very

289
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:59,450
simple. The idea was the fact that, you know,

290
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,379
you should be able to

291
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,229
use your existing orchestrate layer.

292
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,109
You already have done a lot, you've already

293
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,269
have done a lot of work in connecting

294
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:11,509
to your applications, right? You may have the ERPs,

295
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:12,538
the CRMs

296
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:15,239
that you've already connected to, and you essentially

297
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,320
are going to use that to empower

298
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,349
your agents. You already have agents

299
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:21,899
that are performing all of your front-end tasks.

300
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,259
How do you go

301
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,678
from those agents who are just performing

302
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,759
your front-end tasks to actually

303
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,739
go ahead and perform actions on your

304
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:32,590
applications? And that's where my MCP comes in.

305
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,500
Now, Vortado's Enterprise MCP.

306
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:36,369
Takes into account,

307
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,629
you know, Vortado's 12,000+

308
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,869
connectors that allow you to interact

309
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,070
with applications. It uses

310
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,340
our preexisting governance model

311
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,058
to ensure that you're able to interact with it and

312
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:50,558
applications in a secure way.

313
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:53,070
You're able to essentially impersonate

314
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,109
a user to go ahead and perform an action on your

315
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:57,139
behalf. So if I am a

316
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,279
support person who wants to go ahead and check,

317
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,489
and check the status of a, of a request,

318
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,029
the action can be performed on my on on my

319
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:04,849
behalf now,

320
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,190
you know, with, with Rotato's Enterprise MCP.

321
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,830
So essentially,

322
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,158
imagine this, right?

323
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Imagine having your agent, you know,

324
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,629
be it a cloud, be it a chat GPT, be

325
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:15,558
it, be it Bedrock,

326
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,918
you know, to go ahead and say, summarize my open

327
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:18,798
sales pipeline.

328
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,250
Uh, it can essentially go ahead and connect to

329
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,678
my Salesforce instances,

330
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:23,779
look at my John Paul call records,

331
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:28,399
um, because I already have built those connectors,

332
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,129
capture all of that data, and essentially present

333
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,149
to me one unified view

334
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,298
of, of what my sales pipeline is.

335
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,048
Now, the opportunities with MCP

336
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:38,928
are endless,

337
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,330
right? You can apply MCP in

338
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,808
multiple different scenarios, right?

339
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,114
You, you, you can take Your existing business

340
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:45,764
processes,

341
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,724
which, for which you already have the integrations,

342
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:50,913
expose them via MCP to your, you know,

343
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:53,094
to your AI agents, and your AI agents

344
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:54,955
will not, are not gonna help you perform that.

345
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,793
What that does, it really helps

346
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:58,955
adoption at scale.

347
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,835
Earlier, if you had to perform a business

348
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,335
process, you essentially would have to

349
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,673
go ahead and understand what are your APIs

350
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,715
available, what are your services available, and

351
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:08,933
then somebody would have to.

352
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,580
Stretch that through

353
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,479
in a very deterministic manner.

354
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,099
Now with MCP

355
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:16,000
all of that is done through an AI agent.

356
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,639
MCP goes ahead and discovers those APIs, discovers

357
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,879
those applications, and goes ahead and

358
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,879
performs that the action for you. And that's where the

359
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,129
power of MCP lies.

360
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,119
Now, you know, a lot of times I

361
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,779
get asked this question that,

362
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,279
you know, every vendor is talking about

363
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,849
MCP servers, right? We have,

364
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,500
you know, uh, a lot of CRM

365
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,558
applications, ERP applications who essentially

366
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,259
have their own MCP servers.

367
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,349
You know, why,

368
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,298
why would you essentially choose

369
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,320
Vertado's Enterprise MCP over these vendor-specific

370
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,399
MCP servers?

371
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,500
Number one, right? It, it all goes back

372
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,859
to the whole idea of tool proliferation,

373
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:56,500
right? Back in the days,

374
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,979
uh, you know, when this whole idea

375
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,580
of

376
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,279
orchestration started, right, every single company

377
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,298
had their own tool, right? SAP had their own

378
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:06,389
integration tool, um, Oracle

379
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,394
had their own. Tool and all of

380
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:10,533
these tools required you to have

381
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:12,364
still, you, you know, uh,

382
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,634
a separate you know level of skill for

383
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,793
each tool. It also required you to have

384
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:19,043
separate governance models and essentially

385
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:21,075
you, you need to have a separate set of people

386
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,234
who essentially were, were going ahead and managing

387
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,134
these tools

388
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:27,129
now. What that does, it

389
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,229
now with with MCP as well, it's the same

390
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,428
thing, right? Every vendor is gonna have its own MCP tool

391
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,590
which is, which is gonna have its own security

392
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,798
model, it's, its own dominance model, which

393
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,908
gets us to the same point which we were

394
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:39,048
about 20 years ago.

395
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,750
You know, we, we get to a point where there's

396
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,869
again tool proliferation in the states, it's

397
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:45,070
MCP proliferation.

398
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:47,599
Which makes, which makes your life even harder,

399
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,538
but with something like Vertado's Enterprise MCP

400
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,969
where you can essentially interact with

401
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,009
all of the applications that you have

402
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,489
through a single unified layer, it

403
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:59,570
allows you to accelerate your value because

404
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,570
you're essentially building out an MCP

405
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,750
server which is exposed to your agents,

406
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,889
which follows a security protocol that you

407
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,928
have built out. You do not really need to

408
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:10,048
rely on the security protocols that you

409
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:10,788
have from your

410
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,548
vendor specific MCPs.

411
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,349
And it essentially is powered by

412
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,889
by Vortara One, right? You know, our entire

413
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,408
Connectivity landscape really helps you empower

414
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,950
your entire MCP MCP adoption,

415
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,808
and that's where I say that.

416
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:29,009
You know, without an enterprise

417
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,129
MCP you're not orchestrating,

418
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,379
you're actually outsourcing control to

419
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,590
every vendor in your stack

420
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,889
because you essentially are at the mercy of

421
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,899
every vendor that you, that has their own MCP

422
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:39,469
server

423
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,609
to adapt to their,

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,009
uh, to, to adapt to their standards and adapt

425
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,279
to their guidelines. And that's where Rotado's

426
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,308
Enterprise MCP

427
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,788
becomes very, very important.

428
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,340
Finally, right, um,

429
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,940
you know, we, we, we talk a lot about

430
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,849
MCP,

431
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:58,599
but one thing that's core to MCP

432
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,440
and to AI

433
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,259
and for AI to be smarter,

434
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,038
is

435
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,899
the orchestration layer. The orchestration

436
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:05,479
layer

437
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,119
needs to be powerful, needs to be adaptable,

438
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,519
which in a sense, allows you to go

439
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,879
ahead and build your integrations in a manner

440
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,879
which are secure,

441
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:15,899
governed, and scalable.

442
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,619
And that's where Vortado's enterprise

443
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,739
grade abilities come out of the box, right? You are

444
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,058
able to essentially have,

445
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,479
you know, a completely managed offering.

446
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,889
You are essentially able to, to, to deploy

447
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:29,298
your applications in an always on model.

448
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,879
We provide to you zero downtime

449
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,408
upgrades. We provide to you log and audit streaming,

450
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,649
but at the same time,

451
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,759
there are, you can, you can have your orchestrations

452
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:40,200
that can listen to your

453
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,979
applications in multiple ways, right? I can listen to a

454
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:43,639
change.

455
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,219
In an object inside of Salesforce, I can listen

456
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:46,759
to a new

457
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,340
file added to an S3 bucket, and all of

458
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,250
that can be done through Vortato.

459
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,639
So, essentially, the idea is that, you know,

460
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,739
In this agenda journey.

461
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,750
Because, you know, you know, AI agents are the future,

462
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:00,830
but orchestration still remains true.

463
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,408
You need to, you know, partner with a platform that

464
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,849
can really help to make your orchestrations

465
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,149
faster, secure, and more enterprise grade,

466
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,690
and that's where Vortado comes in.

467
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,190
And finally,

468
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,038
you know,

469
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,558
I would, I would, you know, recommend all of you to come

470
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,798
by our booth, booth 1085. We have multiple

471
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,808
live demonstrations, um, available

472
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,058
that will help you, that will help us showcase our

473
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,440
orchestrated energetic platform, show you the

474
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,719
power of Vortaro's Enterprise MCP, and

475
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,500
essentially give you a flavor of

476
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:29,538
what Vortado can do for your business.

477
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:30,460
Thank you.
