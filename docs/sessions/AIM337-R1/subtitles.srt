00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,350
- [Murali] Hello.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,493
Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,340
I hope everybody's doing good.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,770
Thank you for joining our code talk today.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,860
Today let's see how
member-owned financials

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,460
can use agentic AI to improve
their member experience.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,300
I am Murali Ramanathan, Senior
Solutions Architect at AWS.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,220
- [Mrudhula] I'm Mrud Balasubramanyan.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,890
I'm a principal solutions architect.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,610
We work with AWS not
for profit financials.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,577
So how many of you here are
from member-owned financials?

12
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:32,490
Awesome.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,840
Is it credit unions?

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,010
Insurance?

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,543
So how many credit unions?

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,730
Just one.

17
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,740
How about insurance?

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,573
Awesome.

19
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:42,810
You guys outnumber.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,613
Any other member-owned?

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,583
Which one is that?

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,763
- [Murali] Oh, nice.

23
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:50,850
- [Mrudhula] Okay, cool.

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,320
Welcome all.

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,760
You're definitely hardcore

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,593
if you're showing up

27
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:57,930
for the very first session of re:Invent.

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,393
Hopefully we can get you
off to a great start,

29
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,300
and get you a lot

30
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,670
of value out of this
session for your time.

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,637
- All right.
- So, off to you.

32
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:07,470
- [Murali] Yeah.

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,060
In today's session let's see the art

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,470
of possible where we'll be
showing how we can use agentic AI

35
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,930
for loan origination system,

36
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,130
and which will have the
member-owned financials,

37
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,630
process loan applications

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,010
in a much quicker manner,

39
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,990
thereby increasing member satisfaction

40
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,140
and experience as well.

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,020
And this solution we are
going to show today is built

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,140
on AWS AgentCore

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,700
for which Mrudhula is going to talk

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,290
about the features of it.

45
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,520
- [Mrudhula] Awesome.

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,470
So how many of you here have heard

47
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,567
of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore?

48
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:44,490
Awesome.

49
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,103
And have you actually
tried working with it?

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,200
Okay, not yet.

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Okay, so you're in a good place.

52
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,750
So the idea for the code talk today

53
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,380
is to demonstrate a
working, completely working,

54
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,380
end-to-end solution that was
built using AWS Strands agents.

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,870
Anybody heard of Strands?

56
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,160
Awesome.

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
Anybody using other frameworks?

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
Agentic frameworks?

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,059
You can just call it out.

60
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:14,892
- [Audience Member] AutoGen.

61
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,110
- [Mrudhula] AutoGen, okay.

62
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,730
Anybody LangGraph?

63
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,840
TRUE AI.

64
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,673
Okay.

65
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,506
Yep, there you go.

66
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:25,400
So no matter which agentic
framework you work with,

67
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,370
and we are very aware
there are many of them

68
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,880
and there are probably more coming.

69
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,030
AgentCore, which is kind of the,

70
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,090
it was launched last re:Invent

71
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,110
and became generally
available mid-October.

72
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,880
So this is essentially

73
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,050
a comprehensive agentic platform on which,

74
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,630
so the solution that we are
going to be showing you today,

75
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,340
this is the agentic loan
origination system that many of you

76
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,580
in credit unions and banks can relate to.

77
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,740
This is just an example of,

78
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,590
but it's an enterprise-grade production,

79
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,830
almost production-ready solution

80
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,670
that was built using Strands Agents

81
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,590
and then deployed to AgentCore.

82
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,807
So before we get into the architecture,

83
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,270
we want to kind of give you a,

84
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,980
let's get the basics
out of the way, right?

85
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,970
What is AgentCore?

86
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,440
So that when we go into the code

87
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,780
and show you what how it works,

88
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,820
you know exactly what it does.

89
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,640
So Bedrock AgentCore, like I said,

90
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,460
it's a comprehensive agentic platform.

91
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,460
Their you can essentially
deploy and manage your agents.

92
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,080
It's agnostic to the models that you use

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,160
for building your agents.

94
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,240
It's agnostic to the
frameworks that you use

95
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,700
for building those agents as well.

96
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,843
Has a few key components
which I'll go through quickly.

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,270
There's AgentCore runtime

98
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,570
which is essentially the
serverless component,

99
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,350
it's the compute where
you deploy your agents

100
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,363
as container applications.

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,163
And then you have agent memory.

102
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,660
So especially with agents,

103
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,120
you might start off with a single agent,

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,790
you might grow into multiple agents,

105
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,760
you could have multi-agent collaborations.

106
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,760
So the idea is that you have
a managed memory component

107
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,123
that you can associate with your agent.

108
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,390
This can be either short-term memory

109
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,080
that enables those
multi-turn conversations.

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,020
But also if you're working
with multiple agents,

111
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,150
you can have longer term memory as well,

112
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,600
because this then spans multiple sessions

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
across multiple agents.

114
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,000
So agent memory code is
essentially that capability

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,860
of bringing that short-term memory

116
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,860
as well as long-term memory
to your agent applications.

117
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,487
And then another piece that
we're gonna be talking about

118
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:10,323
and that we used in our
solution is AgentCore Gateway.

119
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,910
How many of you have heard of MCP?

120
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,743
Does that ring a bell?

121
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:16,576
Awesome.

122
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,513
You wanna call out what it stands for?

123
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,500
Awesome.

124
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,333
- [Murali] Awesome.

125
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,166
- [Mrudhula] Yeah.

126
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,950
So AgentCore supports

127
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,250
these open-source protocols,

128
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,420
definitely Model Context Protocol, MCP.

129
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,060
And that's really where
AgentCore Gateway shines.

130
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,060
That's essentially your managed
MCP server that you can use

131
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,360
as kind of that unified interface

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,280
that your agents can
communicate with tools

133
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,280
that are set up as targets
behind that AgentCore gateway.

134
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,890
And you can have, you
might have existing APIs

135
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,550
in your organization.

136
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,270
You could have other applications

137
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,300
which you might make an API call to

138
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,690
using a serverless compute like Lambda.

139
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,690
So essentially you can have
a Lambda function running

140
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,770
as an MCP tool, behind that gateway,

141
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,990
you can have your existing APIs.

142
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,180
So it supports open API schema

143
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,280
or Smithy models on the backend.

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,710
So all of those existing resources

145
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,610
can essentially be MCP-fied,
if I might use that,

146
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,900
behind that gateway.

147
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,360
So that's really what that is.

148
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,700
It's that MCP interface.

149
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,680
So we are gonna be talking
about that as well.

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,410
So we covered Agent runtime,

151
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,280
which is the compute,

152
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,970
the gateway, which is
that managed MCP server,

153
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,180
and then the memory, and then
there's the identity piece.

154
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,710
So any enterprise-grade
application definitely requires

155
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,650
end-to-end authentication authorization.

156
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,020
And that AgentCore identity

157
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,643
is that agent-managed identity service.

158
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,580
It centrally Manages the
inbound and outbound auth.

159
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,500
What that means is as you
have your users' applications

160
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,143
that are accessing an agent,

161
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,880
and the agent is making
calls to all those tools,

162
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,120
or in our case we actually have A2A,

163
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,880
so agent to agent communication
is what we're gonna be using

164
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,250
in our multi-agent
collaboration application

165
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,320
that we're gonna show you.

166
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,820
That inbound and outbound
auth is centrally managed

167
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,840
by AgentCore identity which
is seamlessly integrated

168
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,670
with the compute, which is the runtime.

169
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,490
So all of those different
pieces coming together

170
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,660
to help you build a scalable, secure,

171
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,110
enterprise-grade agentic application.

172
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,130
So over to you.

173
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,963
- [Murali] Thank you.

174
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,580
Thank you, Mrudhula, and
this was great explanation.

175
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,530
I wanted to add a couple of more things.

176
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,110
You are also seeing something
called as AgentCore Browser

177
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,970
and AgentCore Interpreter.

178
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,360
These are the tools AgentCore offers.

179
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,530
AgentCore Browser gives you the ability

180
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,490
for the agents to browse
websites on your behalf,

181
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,110
then get the results and process them.

182
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,010
AgentCore Interpreter
gives you the ability

183
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,100
for the agents to run complex create

184
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,730
and run complex code
at the runtime itself.

185
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,280
What that means is you need not write code

186
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,370
which an agent needs to
call and maintain that code.

187
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,420
You can just define

188
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,890
and say what code you want
the agent to create and run.

189
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,880
The agent will do that.

190
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,620
We will see in the example now.

191
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,180
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, so one
other thing that I want

192
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,370
to add quickly is typically with agents

193
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,140
and agentic applications,
you tend to think of them

194
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,460
as black boxes.

195
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,460
So visibility into what
those agents are doing,

196
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,930
that observability aspect, right?

197
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,600
So the three pillars of
observability, the logs,

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,340
the metrics, the traces,

199
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,050
all of those are super important

200
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,570
so that you can trust the
system that you built.

201
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,740
And that's where AgentCore
Observability comes in.

202
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,480
It supports OTel.

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,253
So that's your OpenTelemetry,

204
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,510
and it's integrated with AWS CloudWatch,

205
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,310
if you're familiar with that.

206
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,810
So you can essentially
see at the session level,

207
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,900
at the trace level, as well as the SPAs.

208
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,900
So the granular aspects
of your entire trace,

209
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,790
end-to-end request flow,

210
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,720
and the response flow
of your agentic systems,

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,440
all of those can be seen

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,040
and dashboarded using the OTel logs

213
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,650
and metrics that come out
of AgentCore Observability.

214
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,610
So I want to point that out,

215
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,420
because that's a big piece of
putting these agentic systems

216
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,890
into production.

217
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,670
- [Murali] Awesome.

218
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,087
- [Mrudhula] Yes.

219
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,990
It's a first party tool, yes.

220
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,410
- [Murali] It's a first party tool.

221
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,230
Now let's, I'll walk you
through the architecture

222
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,760
of the solution we built.

223
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,990
Then we'll show a demo,

224
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,460
and then we'll walk you through the code

225
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,560
of the agents as well.

226
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,190
Now here you're seeing the architecture

227
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,120
of the loan origination system
we built using agentic AI.

228
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,700
Let me walk you through
that from left to right.

229
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,190
On the left, you would
see the document upload,

230
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,060
where an applicant uploads there
all of the documents needed

231
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,740
for processing the loan.

232
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,870
As soon as those documents are uploaded,

233
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,540
they come and land on an NS3 bucket.

234
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,670
And once they land on an NS3 bucket,

235
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,950
a Lambda even fires off

236
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,553
and then calls what we call
as the supervisory agent.

237
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,110
Then the supervisory agent
here is tasked with the role

238
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,680
of saying, "You are a supervisor agent

239
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,290
who will be processing loan applications."

240
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,840
And one of the tasks the
supervisor agent would have

241
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,220
is it has to find out what
other agents are there

242
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,460
which can work along
with the supervisor agent

243
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,820
to perform this loan
application process workflow

244
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,370
and then work with them to
get the whole task done.

245
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,130
The supervisor agent, then
using the A2A protocol,

246
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,890
reads the agent cards of
all of the available agents

247
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,820
and then finds out

248
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,070
that there are three
agents it can work with.

249
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,060
The document agent,

250
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,553
the credit risk agent,
and the compliance agent.

251
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,450
Once it decides what
agents it can work with,

252
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,280
then it creates a workflow.

253
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,670
And then as an action item
it calls the document agent

254
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,150
with the information of where
the documents are located.

255
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,220
Now the document agent whose role

256
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,290
is to validate the documents

257
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,950
and also extract the
information from the documents,

258
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,800
knows that it can
validate the information,

259
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,370
but it does not have the
data extraction capability.

260
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,380
Then again using A2A protocol,

261
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,260
it reads the agent cards
of all the other agents

262
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,150
and finds out which agent

263
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,060
has the document extraction capability.

264
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,940
And that's the bedrock
data automation agent here,

265
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,920
and then gives it to that,

266
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,903
passes that information to that agent.

267
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,500
Then that agent has been
tasked with the role

268
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,950
of saying, "You are only
to extract information

269
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,847
from documents using whatever
tools are available to you."

270
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,930
Now this document agent, extraction agent,

271
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,570
then uses the AgentCore Gateway

272
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,950
and does a semantic search

273
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,180
of seeing what tools it
can use to extract data

274
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,590
from the documents.

275
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,570
Then it sees that it has access
to Bedrock Data Automation.

276
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,990
And Bedrock Data Automation is AWS service

277
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,370
which extracts data

278
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,943
from documents images in an
intelligent way using AI.

279
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,700
Now here we are showing
the art of the possible

280
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,080
where the Bedrock Data Automation
agent is accessing the BDA

281
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,440
or the Bedrock Data Automation
using AgentCore Gateway

282
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,590
which is simulating an
MCP what you would have.

283
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,090
So in a real world scenario,

284
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,090
you may not even have a
Bedrock Data Automation agent.

285
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,090
You may have your own data
extraction software running,

286
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,300
and the agent which is connected
to the AgentCore gateway

287
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,710
as an MCP server,

288
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,870
and your Bedrock Data Automation agent

289
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,590
will automatically connect
to it for data extraction.

290
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,240
Once the data is extracted,

291
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
then it gives it back
to the document agent,

292
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,840
and the document agent then
performs all the validation

293
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,630
to ensure that all of the data needed

294
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,270
for processing the loan is there.

295
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,190
Once it performs a validation,

296
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,860
it gives a status check
back to the supervisor agent

297
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,693
along with the data,

298
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,120
saying, "The data validation
is passed or failed."

299
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,090
The supervisor agent, as part
of the workflow it built,

300
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,020
it then decides if the
data validation is passed,

301
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,530
then it'll send it further
down to the credit risk agent

302
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,410
and the compliance agent
for further processing.

303
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,690
But if the data is not there,

304
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,510
using the code interpreter tool as a tool,

305
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,190
it'll again send an email back

306
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,877
to the applicant saying,

307
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:11,340
"There is information missing

308
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,990
from your loan application.

309
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,640
Please provide all of this information

310
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,217
for processing the loan
application further."

311
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,270
Once all of the information is validated,

312
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,950
then the supervisor agent,

313
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,490
as part of its workflow then
will, using A2A protocol,

314
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,820
then gives the information
to the credit risk agent

315
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,660
and the compliance agent
for credit risk processing

316
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,703
and compliance checking as well.

317
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,980
Now here the credit risk agent
using the code interpreter

318
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,090
as a tool, it calls the credit
risk machine learning model

319
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,300
which does the actual
credit risk assessment.

320
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,210
In this demonstration,
this ML model is stored

321
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,260
in an NS3 bucket that
the agent builds code

322
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,260
on the fly using code
interpreter to download it

323
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,000
and then interact with it

324
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
to perform the credit risk assessment.

325
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,560
In a real world scenario,

326
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,120
you will be using the code interpreter

327
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,790
to actually call a sagemaker endpoint

328
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,430
or wherever your ML model is

329
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,910
and interact with it to perform
the credit risk assessment.

330
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,830
And the same way the compliance agent

331
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,410
using the code interpreter
tool builds code

332
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,380
on the fly to perform the
compliance agent checks

333
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,780
and then passes all the information back

334
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,073
to the supervisor agent.

335
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,390
The supervisor agent then
gets all of this information

336
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,080
and then uses its decision
logic which we have provided

337
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,690
in the prompt as a standard
operating procedure

338
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,970
for the supervisor agent,

339
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,610
and then decides to
either approve the loan

340
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,790
or put it under manual review
or disapprove the loan.

341
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,830
Once it performs a decision,

342
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,350
then using the code interpreter again

343
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,840
and using Amazon Simple Email Service,

344
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,200
it sends an email to the
applicant informing the status.

345
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,750
And also it creates a PDF document

346
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,110
of what the loan application
was, all of the details,

347
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,360
and uploads it to an NS3 bucket

348
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,510
so that the underwriter
can review that document

349
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,140
and then perform the
final decisioning as well.

350
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,020
So this way, with this solution,

351
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,410
we are making the
underwriter's job very easy.

352
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,420
We are making sure when the underwriter,

353
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,680
when he has the information,

354
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,510
he has all the right information,

355
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,180
and he can quickly assess that information

356
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,500
and whether approve

357
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,023
or disapprove the loan
based on the criteria.

358
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Now let's go ahead

359
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,660
and see a demonstration of this solution

360
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,607
and then we'll walk you through the code

361
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,427
and how we built that.

362
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,213
- [Mrudhula] Switch the demo.

363
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,790
- [Murali] Yeah.

364
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,640
- [Mrudhula] Yes.

365
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,100
- [Audience Member] You have the model.

366
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,140
This is something, can we
also implement with the MCB,

367
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,620
because what is the feature
engineering that is to be done?

368
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,620
How is it, how does the agent decide

369
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,150
what features it has to extract what is?

370
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,510
- [Mrudhula] So in this case,

371
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,880
we are using the MCP, the model,

372
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,430
for just simply inference purposes, right?

373
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,713
So we're not actually
training, or you know,

374
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,790
feature engineering
data to build the model.

375
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,130
So in this case it's already a built model

376
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,180
that's been deployed.

377
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,910
Yes, yes.

378
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,708
- [Audience Member] For the agent,

379
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,808
how I'll it know what features to extract?

380
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
- [Murali] Yeah, that's a good question.

381
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,040
So basically you can have your
own model as an MCP server,

382
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,900
and in the document,

383
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,330
in the credit risk
assessments agents' prompt,

384
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,150
you would define there as a
standard operating procedure,

385
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,580
like what features you
would be need to passing on,

386
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,440
what features you'd be expecting it.

387
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,000
Using that, it'll build the code

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,247
and then interact with the model.

389
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,080
- [Mrudhula] Yeah.

390
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,683
So as you set that up,
I can clarify further.

391
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,760
So prior to getting into
the credit risk evaluation

392
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,450
or credit worthiness check, before that,

393
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,730
there is another agent

394
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,450
in the workflow which
is the data extraction.

395
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,420
So in the demo, you'll
see, if you're ready,

396
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,253
you can just go ahead with that.

397
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,280
- [Murali] Yeah.

398
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
- [Mrudhula] And I'll explain to you more.

399
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,410
- [Murali] So here I'm playing
now and I'm playing the role

400
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,040
of an applicant where I'll
be uploading the documents.

401
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,720
And because this is a demonstration,

402
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,780
we are not going the process
of using a chat window

403
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,630
and uploading all the information
as that will take time.

404
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,910
So I'm uploading the loan application,

405
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm uploading the pay
stub, bank statement,

406
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,040
employee verification, tax returns,

407
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,190
and all of these are
demo data, by the way.

408
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,520
I have now uploaded my lone application

409
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,570
as an applicant.

410
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,720
Now let us see what
happens in the backend.

411
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,110
Now we are using, as Mrudhula explained,

412
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,060
using AgentCore Observability.

413
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,900
From the logs,

414
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,550
we would be seeing how the agents

415
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,680
are processing the information.

416
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,513
Now we are seeing

417
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:09,790
that the supervisor agent

418
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,950
has discovered all of
those specialized agents,

419
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,020
and then it is sending the workflow,

420
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,890
starting the workflow

421
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,320
by sending the document
to the document agent

422
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,150
for verification.

423
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,600
Then the document agent then
knows that it has to verify

424
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,980
and extract the data.

425
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,920
Now it is searching
for what are the agents

426
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,783
which can do the document extraction.

427
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,590
Then it found the right agent,

428
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,720
which is the document extraction agent,

429
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,220
then it gave that information

430
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,440
to the document extraction agent.

431
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,260
And the document extraction
agent now is using a tool

432
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,290
to communicate with the
Bedrock Data Automation

433
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,253
to extract data.

434
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,193
It'll take a minute

435
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,963
or so for the data
extraction to come back.

436
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,110
- [Mrudhula] And I want to add that all

437
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,320
of this is being done using A2A protocol.

438
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,080
So that's the design pattern that we chose

439
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,090
for this particular solution

440
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,280
because it gives us the most flexibility

441
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,930
in terms of demonstrating

442
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
at an enterprise-grade where you have.

443
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
- [Murali] Sorry to
interrupt you, Mrudhula.

444
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,420
The document agent came
back with the response,

445
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,320
and now the document
validation agent would now take

446
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,460
that process back,

447
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,070
and now it'll be
performing the validation.

448
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,903
Sorry, go ahead.

449
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:25,110
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, no, I was saying

450
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,953
that A2A is really good
when you have, you know,

451
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,620
you might have a handful of
agents now using a few tools,

452
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,120
but then as you start
adopting, building more,

453
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,590
you could be buying,

454
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,573
you could be building agents.

455
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,510
So you soon might have a lot

456
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,210
of different agents using
a lot of different tools.

457
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,730
So like N tools using M number,

458
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,730
of N agents using M number of tools.

459
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,850
So it really becomes a huge matrix.

460
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,790
So A2A helps you,

461
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,410
because it's doing the work for you

462
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,370
in terms of discovering
the agents that are already

463
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,960
in your enterprise using an open protocol.

464
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,250
Agent to agent, right?

465
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,570
So that's the one we choose.

466
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,403
- [Murali] Yep.

467
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,360
Now the document has validated,

468
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,760
and it is passing all of this information

469
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,620
back to the supervisor agent.

470
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,530
And the supervisor agent now has seen

471
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,187
all of that information,
and is now passing it

472
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:34,263
to the credit risk to the
compliance agent in parallel.

473
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,000
Again, as you would
see from the code here,

474
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
we are not defining here

475
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,020
for any agents like the supervisor agent

476
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,310
or the document agent,

477
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,170
you should use that particular agent.

478
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,190
It is able to decide

479
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,290
on its own using the workflow

480
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,693
which agent it has to
use for the processing.

481
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,790
Now you see here, the
compliance agent has been done

482
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,380
and the credit risk agent,

483
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,983
it's now processing it
using the code interpreter.

484
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,520
You'd see that it is downloading
the model from the S3,

485
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,440
then it's interacting with the model

486
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,810
to perform the credit risk assessment.

487
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,643
Again, all of this,

488
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:23,157
it's building the code on the
fly and then executing it.

489
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:23,990
- [Mrudhula] Yep.

490
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,100
And while we are on the credit risk,

491
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,200
to answer your question,

492
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,380
so once the data has been
extracted from the forms,

493
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,800
you now have the information
that you need to send

494
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,740
in the request to the model.

495
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,810
So those are the features,

496
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,973
and those are all based on prompt.

497
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,340
Yeah.

498
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,990
- [Murali] Here the
credit risk has responded

499
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,320
that the ML model predicts
a 98.3% probability

500
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,300
of a successful loan repayment.

501
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,420
Now, the supervisor agent has
got all of this information.

502
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,940
Now it's processing its decision logic

503
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,800
to say whether should I approve the loan

504
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,333
or not, disapprove the loan.

505
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,470
Any questions?

506
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,730
I know it may be a lot to take in,

507
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,880
but if you have any questions,

508
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,577
please let us know.

509
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:14,550
- [Mrudhula] Yes.

510
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,540
- [Audience Member] Do
you have thresholds set

511
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,890
on BDA where you're saying
confidence score needs

512
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,540
to be a certain level before
it's passed back to agent?

513
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,590
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, you
certainly can do that.

514
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,990
I think we are using
some default thresholds

515
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,930
on the back end, but BDA,

516
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,880
if we keep calling it BDA,

517
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,730
but it's actually Amazon
Bedrock Data Automation.

518
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,680
It's a feature of Bedrock,

519
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,630
and this is a capability

520
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,320
where you can essentially extract data

521
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,660
using your custom blueprints.

522
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,090
So in this case, like Murali was showing,

523
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,380
we have used five different
documents that are pertinent

524
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,243
to a loan application.

525
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,740
But you could have, using
Bedrock Data Automation,

526
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,680
you can essentially work
with multimodal data.

527
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,700
So that can be text, images,
video, what have you.

528
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,800
And then you can specify blueprints,

529
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,300
which is essentially the schema

530
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,050
for kind of the overlay on your data

531
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,540
so that you extract
only the specific fields

532
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,500
that you care about.

533
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,240
And then because it's AI-powered,

534
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,410
it's going to come back
with explainability

535
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,080
in terms of the probability

536
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,060
for essentially the accuracy
of extracting that information.

537
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,890
So you can then use your business rules

538
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,350
to decide what the threshold should be.

539
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,030
And that's also a good,

540
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,600
that threshold is the
criteria that you would set

541
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,840
to maybe incorporate a human in the loop

542
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,753
if you feel that it's below the threshold.

543
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,960
And typically something for
like credit decisioning,

544
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,030
you do want to have a human in the loop,

545
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,030
because especially if it's
a deny, not an approve,

546
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,910
you want to make sure your loan officer

547
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,410
takes a good look at it,

548
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,540
looks at the probabilities

549
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,943
of the information that was extracted,

550
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,300
and use that as the basis

551
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,020
to see why it was approved or denied.

552
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,890
That makes sense.

553
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,850
- [Murali] Yeah, and here you see

554
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,790
that the supervisor agent
has completed the workflow

555
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,280
and it has given a final
decision of approve.

556
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,070
And it's showing all of
the workflow summary.

557
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,030
Now, all of these you are
seeing is in the Observability,

558
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,370
which is on the CloudWatch logs.

559
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,830
So anytime you know you want to check,

560
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,680
trace back what happened for
a particular application.

561
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,810
What were the steps the agents took,

562
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,610
how did they arrive at the decision?

563
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,040
All of them are there for audit purposes,

564
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,420
and you can see,

565
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,720
ensure that the right decisions
are being made all the time.

566
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,733
Now let's look at the
PDF it has generated.

567
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,840
So this is the PDF it generated.

568
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,123
Again, we will walk through the code now.

569
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,090
We just prompted the,

570
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,070
in the prompt of the supervisor agent,

571
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,950
we said, "Create a PDF
with all of these details,"

572
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,053
and it automatically created all of these.

573
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,730
It gives all of the information
for the underwriter,

574
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,890
like what is the credit risk assessment,

575
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,630
what's the compliant validation,

576
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,890
what are the next steps?

577
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,090
All of those things,

578
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,310
it will be there in the PDF,

579
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,110
and the underwriter can use this

580
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,393
to make their decisions very quickly.

581
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,870
Now, any questions on the solution?

582
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,160
Go ahead, please.

583
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,930
- [Audience Member] How do you
guys prevent prompt injection

584
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,310
for the upload of documents?

585
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,680
How do you ensure that those
documents don't have any

586
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,193
sort of injection prompts in
them to attack your model?

587
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:01,020
- [Murali] That's a good question.

588
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,420
So as Mrudhula explained earlier,

589
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,000
all of these agents use A2A protocol,

590
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,610
and all of them use OAuth authentication.

591
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,830
So within the OAuth authentication,

592
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,160
when these agents wants to
communicate with each other,

593
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,960
only if they have the right token,

594
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,580
they would be able to communicate

595
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,400
and access those functionalities.

596
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,840
Any other external,

597
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,170
if some other agent wants to
interact with these agents,

598
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,180
as you said, to do a prompt injection,

599
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,010
that would not be possible.

600
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,060
- [Mrudhula] So I'll add to that.

601
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,460
That's because that's a
very important question.

602
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,740
So we haven't used that in
this specific solution per se,

603
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,210
but this is what you can do

604
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,000
to make sure that you don't have issues

605
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,590
with prompt injection

606
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,820
or any other any of the
OWASP agentic AI risks

607
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,020
and how to mitigate them, right?

608
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,240
So on that main.

609
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,070
So, Strands Agents is the one

610
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,510
that we are using here.

611
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,490
That supports Guardrails.

612
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,633
So if you're familiar with
Amazon Bedrock Guardrails,

613
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,270
it's essentially a capability

614
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,770
where you can specify
automated reasoning checks,

615
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,710
grounded checks, denied topics,

616
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,773
which is more around the
question that's being asked.

617
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,220
Moderate content, things like that.

618
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,630
All of those filters can be
something that you can associate

619
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,620
with the guardrail,

620
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,980
and that guardrail
itself can be associated

621
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,660
with the model that is used in
the definition of your agent.

622
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,890
So as we go into the code,

623
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,360
I can show you the exact lines

624
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,070
of code where you can
associate a guardrailed model

625
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,270
in the agent itself.

626
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,493
So that is supported.

627
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,380
- [Murali] Awesome.

628
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,213
- [Mrudhula] Yes.

629
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:45,150
- [Audience Member] There's a lot

630
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,420
of numbers here that are
needing to be very accurate.

631
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,020
How are you passing the extraction tool

632
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,170
and several agents in the way
with several different calls.

633
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,430
How are you ensuring

634
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,810
that the data that's extracted
is what the models are seeing

635
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,280
from each of those individual calls?

636
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,740
Is that some stored
memory somewhere, or like,

637
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,660
how are you actually relying

638
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,910
or making sure that those
numbers are accurate

639
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,560
by the time it gets to
the supervisor agent?

640
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,670
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, great question.

641
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,990
And I think that also leads

642
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,900
into kind of the auditability
of this solution, right?

643
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,733
Yeah.

644
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:20,220
So when we talked about the
Bedrock Data Automation,

645
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,680
the BDA tool, which is the one,

646
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,400
the workhorse that's actually
looking at the documents,

647
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,630
extracting the information,

648
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,240
giving you the probabilities
for all of that,

649
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,230
all of that data,

650
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,230
extracted data gets persisted
inside object store, S3.

651
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,630
So long after the process is done,

652
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,520
that data is still there

653
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,370
for you to look at anytime
by your regulators,

654
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,910
your compliance officers, anybody,

655
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,730
and that then becomes the source.

656
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,160
So the agents are simply just doing the,

657
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,080
kind of the back and forth of,

658
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
- [Murali] Orchestration.

659
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,940
- [Mrudhula] Orchestration.

660
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,370
They encapsulate your business logic,

661
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,573
but the data itself is
persisting in that object store.

662
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,283
- [Murali] Now let's look at
how we build the solution.

663
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,910
And one of the first things I want

664
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,950
to mention is we built all

665
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,743
of the solution using Kiro Agentic IDE.

666
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,820
So using Kiro, we worked with Kero,

667
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,670
you can call Kiro as one of our members.

668
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,400
It helped us build out this whole solution

669
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,500
in a very quick manner.

670
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,790
- [Mrudhula] So shall I do this?

671
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,623
- [Murali] Yes.

672
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,410
- [Mrudhula] How many of you
have played with Kiro before?

673
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,400
Have you even heard of it?

674
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,233
Okay.

675
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,066
- [Murali] Just give me a second.

676
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,597
So let me.

677
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:43,920
- [Mrudhula] Yeah.

678
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,920
So this is our latest agentic coding tool.

679
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,380
It's agentic AI IDE,
essentially standalone.

680
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,710
It's built from the ground up.

681
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,030
It's not a plugin into any IDE,

682
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,920
like Q Developer you might have heard of.

683
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,753
This is kind of a standalone IDE,

684
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,493
and it's really good at
spec-driven development.

685
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,750
So we used the IDE for developing this.

686
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,810
So I wanted to show you

687
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,810
the spec-driven
development pretty briefly.

688
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,583
Okay.

689
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,463
So unlike vibe coding,

690
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,803
any vibe coders here?

691
00:31:42,657 --> 00:31:43,490
Everybody?

692
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,270
Nope, nope, no vibe coders, okay.

693
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,950
I thought if you didn't raise a hand,

694
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,750
that means everybody's a vibe coder.

695
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,753
No worries.

696
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:52,740
So Kiro supports vibe coding,

697
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,520
but we are not just
looking at POCs, right?

698
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,720
We are looking at

699
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,930
how do you build an
enterprise-grade application.

700
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,810
So we are following a
very rigorous process

701
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,990
of using spec-driven development.

702
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,310
And what I'm showing you
here are the assets of that,

703
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,480
essentially your requirements,

704
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,010
your design, and your tasks,

705
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,380
so you can implement the solution.

706
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,453
So part of the requirements, it's,

707
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,650
essentially the entire SDLC, right?

708
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,460
Starting with what are your user stories

709
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,330
and what are the requirements
associated with each of those.

710
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,980
So like we mentioned,

711
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,103
we wanted to use the A2A protocol.

712
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,100
That was our starting point

713
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,990
that was one of our main requirements.

714
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,610
So as a systems architect,

715
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,673
I want all my agents to
communicate using this protocol.

716
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,690
So, you know, a lot of requirements there.

717
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,070
Agent discovery, again,

718
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,970
this is based on Strand supports this.

719
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,323
AgentCore supports this using agent cards.

720
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,240
And then there's quite a bit.

721
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,740
It's pretty comprehensive,

722
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,140
but just for each of
the agents themselves,

723
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,780
they have very specific requirements.

724
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,970
Like the BDA agent has its own set

725
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,253
of acceptance criteria and so on.

726
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,363
And then going into the design,

727
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,060
the idea is measure
twice, cut once, right?

728
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,060
Make sure you come up with, you know,

729
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,153
the way we did this was we used Kiro,

730
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,220
gave a kind of a brief description

731
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,350
of the problem that we were solving.

732
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,440
And Kiro came up with all of these assets,

733
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,540
the requirements, design, and task.

734
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,130
But that's just the first draft.

735
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,990
It's a pretty iterative process,

736
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,113
so you can review what it comes up with,

737
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,100
then you can modify using
your natural language prompts.

738
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,220
So continue to define
the design until you get

739
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,070
to a state where this feels
like it's pretty close

740
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,020
to your use case.

741
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,610
And that's exactly what we did.

742
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,217
So it comes up with the
as-built architecture,

743
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,640
the loan request coming
to the supervisor agent,

744
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,070
which is then communicating using A2A

745
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,410
with all the specialized agents.

746
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:23,490
So lots of information
when you work through this

747
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,250
in terms of what the design should be,

748
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,143
and then into the tasks.

749
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,360
So these are tasks that you were,

750
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,720
it's doing the tasks in a phased manner,

751
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,300
starting with the infrastructure setup.

752
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,960
So this is infrastructure
beyond just AgentCore.

753
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,530
These are basic things like
setting up your S3 buckets,

754
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,650
right, which is where your input data,

755
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,960
so all your loan application forms,

756
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,940
all of those get stored,

757
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,050
as well as the data that's
extracted by Data Automation,

758
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,370
that gets persisted as well.

759
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,980
So getting all those buckets set up,

760
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,780
getting your OAuth set up.

761
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,700
So in our case, we used
Amazon Cognito for that.

762
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,010
You might have your own IDP that you want

763
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,090
to integrate with, right?

764
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,620
Like Okta or Entra ID and so on.

765
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,650
So getting that OAuth
set up is another piece

766
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,903
of getting ready to build a solution.

767
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,573
The other things are too is,

768
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,590
how do you store your secrets, right?

769
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,090
Like secrets manager,
that's a very important one.

770
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,950
And then your IAM roles, right,

771
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,210
your permissions that each
of your agents would have

772
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,040
to interact with other AWS services.

773
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,490
Then things like Amazon Bedrock Gateway,

774
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,150
AgentCore Gateway that I mentioned.

775
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,560
So that needs to get set up

776
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,540
so that you can then the agents
can then access the tools

777
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,170
that are targets behind
that AgentCore Gateway.

778
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,840
So some of that infrastructure
needs to be done upfront.

779
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,863
So that's phase one,

780
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,450
and then phase two is
essentially building all

781
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,550
of your agents and then deploying them

782
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,580
to AgentCore runtime,
which is your compute.

783
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,580
So a complete set of tasks
which then get checked off

784
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,100
as Kiro starts implementing your solution.

785
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,820
So just a structured approach

786
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,160
to having an end-to-end solution.

787
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,993
- [Murali] Awesome.

788
00:36:32,993 --> 00:36:33,870
So now let me walk you

789
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,423
through how we build the supervisor agent.

790
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,640
So all of these agents,

791
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,140
we'll be explaining them basically

792
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,120
by breaking down into four sections.

793
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,540
The first section is what all
libraries you need to import.

794
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,017
Here we are saying, you know,

795
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:53,133
"You need to import the
Strands multi-agent A2A

796
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:57,240
from A2A servers," that
enables the A2A communication.

797
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,480
Then you also need to
import the A2A client

798
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,980
from the client tool provider

799
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,350
so that it is able to discover the agents.

800
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,900
Then we are also importing
the code interpreter

801
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,540
so that you can provide
the code interpreter

802
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,073
as a tool to the agents.

803
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,050
And the other two libraries

804
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,940
are making sure, you
know, those are required

805
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,223
for running the A2A agent as servers.

806
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,390
Then we have the configuration
section where we configure

807
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,400
in a what's our AWS region,

808
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,990
what are the buckets we are using,

809
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,600
any other parameters we are using.

810
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,950
And we also have a code.

811
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,140
And this is only bit of
the code you would see

812
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,580
in all of this, where, you know,

813
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,870
how we are handling the OAuth
tokens between the agents.

814
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,420
When this agent needs to
communicate to another agent,

815
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,730
they need to have the
refreshed OAuth token.

816
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,490
And this part of the
code would handle that.

817
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,860
Again here as Mrudhula mentioned,

818
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,890
for the client ID client secret token URL

819
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,650
used for OAuth tokens,
we retrieve all of them

820
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,180
from the secrets manager

821
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,280
to make sure they are not exposed as well.

822
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,270
And this would be the main part

823
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,180
of the supervisor agent
which is the prompt.

824
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,180
In the prompt, we define what
is the role of the agent,

825
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,490
basically what task
it's going to be doing.

826
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,150
Then we are going to also
define how we are going

827
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,980
to be discovering the
other available agents,

828
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,720
what kind of tools you would be accessing

829
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,423
to discover the other agents.

830
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,420
Then we will also be defining like

831
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,010
as a standard operating procedure,

832
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,350
when you are selecting another agents,

833
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,210
what are the qualities
you need to look for

834
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,940
in those agents when you want to pass

835
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,260
on the tasks to them.

836
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,410
As an example, if you want to use an agent

837
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,850
for document validation,

838
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,470
then you need to ensure that

839
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,570
when you read the agent card it has words

840
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,440
like document, validation,
compliance, completeness, etc,

841
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,820
in their agent card.

842
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,420
So only use those agents
for document validation.

843
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,180
So here we are making sure
we are guiding the agents

844
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,883
to make sure they perform
the way we intend to.

845
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,750
Then we are also making sure
how agent communication,

846
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,420
as many of you ask questions,

847
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,690
how does agent know what
data comes back and forth?

848
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,420
How they would be interacting with other,

849
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,610
as an example, an ML model.

850
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,130
This is where we define what is the type

851
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,990
of output you would be expecting,

852
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,823
what is the type

853
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,380
of output you should be
sending to other agents.

854
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,680
We would be defining all
of these things here.

855
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,180
And then specifically for
credit risk assessment,

856
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,940
what you should make sure,
like one of the things,

857
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,780
we are ensuring

858
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,440
that you are passing the
entire validated data structure

859
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,500
to the credit risk assessment
so that whatever agent

860
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,200
is performing the credit risk assessment,

861
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,703
it has got all of the data.

862
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,080
Do not just truncate some of
the data and pass it across.

863
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,353
So these are the instructions
we provide to the agent.

864
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,560
And finally, we also
provide the decision logic.

865
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,070
How it has to say if a loan
application is approved

866
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,170
or manual review or rejected,

867
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,813
what is the decision logic
is it needs to follow.

868
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,320
Then after completing it,

869
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,633
we are saying, "Once you create your,

870
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,880
you have your decision,

871
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,450
then use the tool to make a PDF report."

872
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,870
And we are just specifying
what information must be there

873
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,103
in the PDF report,

874
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,340
and what are the PDF report
requirements we are specifying.

875
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,370
Then we are saying, "Upload
it to an S3 bucket."

876
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,320
We are saying which bucket you
should need to upload it to.

877
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,500
Then we are saying where
you should send an email to.

878
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,130
Because this is a demonstration
system, we built out,

879
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,540
we made sure that all

880
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,880
of the emails go to
just one email address.

881
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,680
But in a real-world scenario,

882
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,530
you can specify that
pick up the email address

883
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,750
from the loan application

884
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,810
or from the conversation
you had with the applicant,

885
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,150
then send that response
back to that email.

886
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,773
It would go ahead and do that.

887
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,900
And you would also want

888
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,900
to say how you want
your email to look like.

889
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,750
What is the formatting, all of those.

890
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,910
Now, again, one of the
key advantages of this is

891
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,380
if tomorrow a requirement changes,

892
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,283
all you would have to do is
come back and change the prompt,

893
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,450
which is very easy to do

894
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,900
because this is more like
natural language where you define

895
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,150
in your own natural language saying

896
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,470
what you want the agent to do,

897
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,020
rather than having it as written as a code

898
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,250
and maintaining the code,

899
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,100
just come and change the prompt here.

900
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,536
It can quickly adapt to your
changing business requirements.

901
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,027
- [Audience Member] I
have one more question.

902
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:58,694
(audience member murmuring)

903
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,130
Is the outcome also is the
same for the next time?

904
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,590
Maybe the first one is like this,

905
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,790
but is there any guarantee
deterministic that the output

906
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,593
for the second one will be the same?

907
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,040
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, so yeah,

908
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,570
you're basically bringing out

909
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,273
the non-deterministic nature
of these agents, right?

910
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,385
However, in this case,

911
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:29,163
provided in this case your
inputs are still the same.

912
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:31,770
It's the same set of documents,

913
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:36,770
and the logic inside each of
these agents, like for example,

914
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,850
the calculation of credit worthiness,

915
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,260
whatever business logic you have

916
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,830
inside the credit risk agent, for example,

917
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,960
those are still pretty deterministic

918
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,493
because those are just
mathematical calculations.

919
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,260
So the agents themselves are,

920
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,860
it's not like a text-based prediction.

921
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,460
Yes, you're using a lot of
prompts to drive the work,

922
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,630
but you are under the hood

923
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,480
in those prompts being very specific.

924
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,920
And this is where like we
were mentioning the SOPs,

925
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,310
the operating procedures,
come into play, right?

926
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,510
As long as you have that
clearly defined in the prompts,

927
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,400
the calculations will follow,

928
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,180
and then the results of those
are still deterministic.

929
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,130
And so the input stays the same,

930
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,960
the data extracted stays the same.

931
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,390
And as long as the,

932
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,480
even with like the data
BDA tool that you're using

933
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,460
for extracting data from each of those,

934
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,830
for each of those documents,

935
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,143
if you're still keeping
that same threshold,

936
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,760
the data that's input

937
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,330
into those downstream
mathematical calculations

938
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,193
still is the same, right?

939
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,840
So you should not see for
example something flip

940
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,023
from an approval to a
denial kind of thing.

941
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,350
- [Murali] And as a best practice.

942
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,670
Yeah, go ahead please.

943
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,733
- [Mrudhula] Yeah.

944
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:12,400
(audience member murmuring)

945
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,108
- [Audience Member] So how
do you expect this solution

946
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:23,120
like digital business
would work differently,

947
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,613
that says, oh, today I'm
taking 3% of the earning.

948
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,730
That's my mistake, right?

949
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,707
That's a business question.

950
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:35,790
How would that?

951
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,260
- [Murali] So if I understand
your question right,

952
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,140
you today you may have a DTI requirement,

953
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,240
tomorrow you have another DTI requirement.

954
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,230
How you would want to adapt that?

955
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,240
As you know, all you
can go at is, you know,

956
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,920
can change in your system prompt.

957
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,530
How would you want the
decisioning logic to be done on

958
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,138
based on the DTI?

959
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:56,220
- [Audience Member] How do you do the DTI?

960
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,970
I don't see any here documentation.

961
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:01,410
- [Murali] Yes, yes.

962
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,993
- [Audience Member] Is this a requirement?

963
00:45:04,549 --> 00:45:07,616
(audience member murmuring)

964
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:10,947
But I'm not seeing a lot
of business requirement.

965
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:11,780
- [Murali] Yeah.

966
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,613
So the DTI prompts,

967
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:15,480
that is not how it calculates the DTI.

968
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,880
That is in the compliance
validation agent.

969
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,870
That's where it

970
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,690
is calculating the DTI
using the code interpreter.

971
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,770
There you can define how you
want the DTI to be calculated.

972
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,110
The supervisor agent, in this,

973
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,300
the supervisor agent is
just playing the role

974
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,180
of an orchestrator where
it is passing information

975
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,980
to all of these other agents

976
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,380
who have their tasks clearly defined.

977
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,300
As you said, for the DTI agent,

978
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,910
it'll be the compliance
agent where, you know,

979
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,300
you will have the prompt defining how you

980
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,910
are calculating the DTI
using the code interpreter,

981
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,260
and there you can define
your thresholds there.

982
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,820
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, I think we
haven't shown that piece yet,

983
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,260
but there's a specialized agent

984
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,600
and the prompt which captures that, yep.

985
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,530
Yes.

986
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,120
- [Audience Member] So
designing a system like this,

987
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,050
how do you recommend
evaluating model accuracy

988
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,180
between the different models
if you were to switch out

989
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,713
for let's say a newer model?

990
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,830
- [Murali] That's a good question.

991
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,830
In Bedrock, we have something
called as model evaluation,

992
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,160
where before you start
building these solutions,

993
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,790
you can start evaluating a model.

994
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,540
There are two types of
model evaluations we offer.

995
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,760
One is we have curated data sets

996
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,250
where you use those curated data sets

997
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,350
to have the model run against them,

998
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,940
and you can see the accuracy,

999
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,280
or you can bring in your own data

1000
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,060
and use it against those models
to see which one works best

1001
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,403
and then use it in your system.

1002
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,840
- [Mrudhula] So basically
it requires you to have some

1003
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,700
kind of ground truth data,

1004
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,380
something that you have historically

1005
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,770
for similar profiles of customers,

1006
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,410
what the loan decisioning has been.

1007
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,890
And then there's definitely
a lot of work involved.

1008
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,310
You need to set up that
evaluation harness on your end

1009
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,640
so that when you deploy
these kinds of systems,

1010
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,640
you have something, some
kind of gold standard

1011
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,683
to compare to the results
that are coming out of it.

1012
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,090
And that, we can't emphasize enough

1013
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,650
the importance of testing,

1014
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:30,003
especially with these
non-deterministic applications.

1015
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,737
- [Audience Member] Is
that framework something

1016
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:33,570
that you would build

1017
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,330
into this application
or even run separately?

1018
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,530
- [Mrudhula] So we have,

1019
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,310
I haven't gone through
the entire task list,

1020
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,143
but in the design itself,

1021
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,490
some of the aspects of that
design include testing,

1022
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,240
that's end-to-end testing.

1023
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,970
So that includes unit
testing, integration testing,

1024
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:54,990
all of that.

1025
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,217
And if you have specific evaluation

1026
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,170
like metrics and things like that,

1027
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,870
and a source of data
that you can point to,

1028
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,063
all of that can be incorporated as well.

1029
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,820
- [Audience Member] Have
you used any pattern

1030
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,540
to ground the image like
reflection, how do we use it?

1031
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,010
- [Mrudhula] Like design patterns?

1032
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:25,010
So we are in this case using
the Strands A2A design pattern.

1033
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,720
It's pretty standard.

1034
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,030
Strands also supports others like workflow

1035
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,100
which are more deterministic.

1036
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,950
The graph-based design,

1037
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,430
like graph as in like each
of these specialized agents

1038
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,230
can be nodes,

1039
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:43,860
and you can have
essentially like in a graph,

1040
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,830
you can have edges connect between,

1041
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,560
if you think of each of
the agents as being a node,

1042
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,250
the communication between them is an edge.

1043
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,250
So you can define what
that multi-agent structure

1044
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,350
needs to look like in a graph.

1045
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:07,680
So that is one of the
other design patterns

1046
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,980
that's supported natively
by Strands agents.

1047
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,920
A2A is, it's a more flexible

1048
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,500
based on agent discovery
that we are using.

1049
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,720
But you know, this is one

1050
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,860
of the design patterns that's supported

1051
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,510
inside Strands framework as well.

1052
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,103
Yeah.

1053
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:29,770
(audience member murmuring)

1054
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:35,047
- [Mrudhula] Like the
React pattern, right?

1055
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:35,880
Yeah.

1056
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,230
- [Murali] These use the React part

1057
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,460
where they do the reasoning

1058
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,900
and an actioning of it

1059
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,460
where they reason that
given I have this task of,

1060
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,170
as a supervisor agent,

1061
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,530
his task is I have to process
these loan applications

1062
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,390
and I have a set of tools to me,

1063
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,720
and they use a reasoning
to create a workflow,

1064
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,370
then use available tools,

1065
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,000
the agents and the code
interpreter, to perform the tasks.

1066
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,833
- [Mrudhula] Yeah.

1067
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,250
Are you validating the Strand?

1068
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,083
- [Murali] Yes.

1069
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,820
- [Mrudhula] So I think the best way

1070
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,720
to get to your question
is so reflection, right?

1071
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,560
So this is based on the model
capability as well, you know.

1072
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,930
So in this case the model

1073
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,410
that we are using is
Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5

1074
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,260
which is very capable of reflection.

1075
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,670
So it's built into,

1076
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,650
so that's the one that's the brains

1077
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,483
behind each of these agents.

1078
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,600
As newer models come along

1079
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,330
that can support even
more advanced deflection

1080
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,480
or additional patterns, you can have,

1081
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,770
like I was saying,
these AgentCore Strands,

1082
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,140
they're all model agnostic.

1083
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,560
Each agent can essentially
you can use a bedrock model

1084
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,020
or you can use an open-source model,

1085
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,260
and each agent can use a different model.

1086
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,970
It doesn't have to be the same model.

1087
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,470
So it's inbuilt

1088
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,890
into the agent itself based
on the model selection.

1089
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,090
- [Murali] That's a good segue.

1090
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,300
The last fourth section
which we wanted to show

1091
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,560
in the code is after the prompts

1092
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,840
is how we are defining the agent here.

1093
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,990
If you're looking at
here we define the agent,

1094
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,670
what is the name of the agent,

1095
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,470
the description of the agent,

1096
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,930
the system prompt which is
the system prompt we saw

1097
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,880
in detail, and as Mrudhula mentioned,

1098
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,460
the model which is agnostic.

1099
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,060
Again you can choose what
model works best for you

1100
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,070
and you can have that model here.

1101
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,950
And the tools are all the
tools like agent discovery

1102
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,500
and the code interpreter tools.

1103
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,130
And finally we have the agent
running as an A2A server.

1104
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,860
So that way each of these agents,

1105
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,320
they use a two-way communication to

1106
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,510
between them whenever
they want to communicate.

1107
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,820
The advantage of using
an A2A communication

1108
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,210
is tomorrow you may have another
agents which is not running

1109
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,210
on AgentCore but still
using A2A communications.

1110
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,080
These agents running

1111
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,430
on AgentCore can communicate
with them as well.

1112
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,993
- [Mrudhula] Yes.

1113
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:07,230
(audience member murmuring)

1114
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:12,027
- [Mrudhula] The data the that's
passed between the agents.

1115
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:12,860
Yeah.

1116
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,770
So in this case

1117
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:18,243
since we're using A2A, it's
a JSON RPC message format.

1118
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:24,140
And so this is, the output
of one agent gets passed

1119
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,500
in that format, the JSON
RPC format, to the agent,

1120
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,210
like the supervisor agent, for example.

1121
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:37,620
So that message body
contains all the information.

1122
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,923
That's basically the input
that's needed by the next agent.

1123
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,310
- [Murali] All of these
agents uses HTTPs protocol.

1124
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,630
So all of those,

1125
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,240
whenever they are
communicating between them,

1126
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,300
even when they are
communicating this JSON data

1127
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,623
between them, they are all encrypted.

1128
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:03,290
(audience member murmuring)

1129
00:53:14,017 --> 00:53:14,850
- [Mrudhula] Yeah.

1130
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:19,850
And there is on the OAuth
happening every step of the way.

1131
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,340
So the OAuth setup that we used

1132
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,360
at the beginning that I was talking

1133
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,930
about using Cognito, that
you know, you're using.

1134
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,970
So yeah, this is a very important piece

1135
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,710
that we probably haven't mentioned yet,

1136
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,920
is when you deploy your agent,

1137
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,043
you configure the OAuth,

1138
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,690
the auth configuration
for each of those agents.

1139
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,650
So you can have something like IAM SigV4

1140
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,720
if you're familiar with that.

1141
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,890
That's the default,

1142
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,860
but it also supports OAuth 2.0.

1143
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,470
So in this case, every
agent that we deploy,

1144
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,710
there is a configuration
that needs to happen

1145
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,400
and we set that up as
like a JWT custom token.

1146
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,340
So every single one

1147
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,340
of those agent interactions is
authenticated and authorized.

1148
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,603
Yeah.

1149
00:54:14,603 --> 00:54:17,220
- [Murali] I think you had
one question we'll take.

1150
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,720
Yes.

1151
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,667
(audience member murmuring)

1152
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,525
- [Mrudhula] Correct, yes.

1153
00:54:24,525 --> 00:54:28,108
(audience member murmuring)

1154
00:54:28,108 --> 00:54:29,791
- [Mrudhula] No, correct.

1155
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:33,458
(audience member murmuring)

1156
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,000
- [Mrudhula] So RBAC control, you said?

1157
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,667
(audience member murmuring)

1158
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,720
- [Mrudhula] So these are
tools behind the gateway.

1159
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,420
Are you referring to the
tools behind the gateway?

1160
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,253
Yes.

1161
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,990
So the agent itself.

1162
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,300
So in this case, for
example, the BD agent,

1163
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,440
the data extraction agent

1164
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,173
that's actually calling the making that,

1165
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,130
we set up what is called
an MCP client on the agent.

1166
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,950
So the agent is acting as your MCP client,

1167
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:12,300
and then it's communicating
with the AgentCore gateway,

1168
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,640
which is that MCP server.

1169
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,540
And behind that you have
essentially a lambda

1170
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,093
that's making an API call to Bedrock BDA.

1171
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:27,530
So the communication between
the NCP client and gateway is,

1172
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,280
it's an OAuth 2 authentication
and authorization as well.

1173
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:40,410
And then behind that,
it's all IAM permissions.

1174
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,480
So that's where RBAC comes in.

1175
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,313
Yeah.

1176
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,840
Yes.

1177
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,673
- [Audience Member]
Here you have mentioned

1178
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:49,740
like all the tools in the single agent.

1179
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,730
So I have experience,

1180
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,380
like if we provide more than
like 40 tools or something.

1181
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,453
Agent gets started confusing,

1182
00:55:57,453 --> 00:55:59,820
like between choosing each of the tools.

1183
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,260
- [Mrudhula] Correct.

1184
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,310
Yeah.

1185
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,930
You want to talk about
the semantic search?

1186
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:04,763
- [Murali] Yes.

1187
00:56:04,763 --> 00:56:09,240
So one of the ones we have in
Agent Gateway is what we call

1188
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,890
as a semantic search.

1189
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:15,890
And as you said, giving
agent more than 40 tools,

1190
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,977
and it does not decide what tools to use.

1191
00:56:17,977 --> 00:56:19,200
There are two things.

1192
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,680
One is making sure our
prompt is very clear

1193
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,420
of what our requirements are

1194
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,570
so that it specifically knows
what the task it has got

1195
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,943
and then it can search the right tool.

1196
00:56:29,943 --> 00:56:32,730
And AgentCore gateway
supports something called

1197
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,440
as a semantic search.

1198
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,280
In this case, when we say the BDA,

1199
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,410
when the Bedrock Data Automation agent,

1200
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,720
when it has to do a data extraction,

1201
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,680
it first does a semantic
search like data extraction.

1202
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,620
What tools are there
available for data extraction?

1203
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:53,010
And then the gateway
returns available tools

1204
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,480
which are there for data extraction.

1205
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,690
Then it chooses that and
perform the data extractions.

1206
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,930
In your case, if you have
got more than 40 tools,

1207
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:04,590
you can have it behind a
gateway, AgentCore gateway,

1208
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,960
and then the agent can
do a semantic search

1209
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,570
based on the task what it wants.

1210
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,690
Then the AgentCore gateway
will return maybe out

1211
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,830
of 40 tools, maybe 10 tools.

1212
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,210
And then out of those 10 tools,

1213
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,287
the AgentCore is then able to,

1214
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,720
the agent is able to select the right tool

1215
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,010
to perform the task.

1216
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:20,940
- [Mrudhula] Yeah, and I'll add

1217
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,570
that really the best
practice is you want to think

1218
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,880
of the agent as being
a microservice, right,

1219
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,563
essentially that same mindset.

1220
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,880
So depending on it's
definitely purpose built

1221
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,860
for that business function.

1222
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,370
So you want to give it the
tools only that it needs

1223
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,303
and only the permissions that
it needs for those tools.

1224
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:47,400
So you know, you don't
want to have 40 tools,

1225
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,160
for example, the specialized
agencies especially should only

1226
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,370
have a couple of tools, two,

1227
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,043
three tools that it really
needs to get the job done.

1228
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,623
In the supervisor agent,

1229
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:03,090
this is accumulating, because it's trying

1230
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:07,887
to help the specialized agents figure out

1231
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,530
which tools to use.

1232
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,490
It's listing them, but the
supervisor agent itself

1233
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,220
is not ready calling those tools.

1234
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,053
So there's a little.

1235
00:58:18,053 --> 00:58:19,260
It's different, right?

1236
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,010
So but yes, that's a very good point.

1237
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,830
You know, you need to
have purpose built agents

1238
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,870
and just the tools that they need.

1239
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,430
- [Murali] We just have one
and a half minutes left,

1240
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,800
so I'll just walk through one more agent

1241
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,870
and any other questions, we are available

1242
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,400
outside the room to take them as well.

1243
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,440
- [Mrudhula] Actually we
can just wrap and go to the.

1244
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,273
- [Murali] I just wanted

1245
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:41,430
to quickly showcase the
compliance agent, the prompt,

1246
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,980
and show you know how it is doing

1247
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,750
the debt to income ratio.

1248
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,220
You would see in the prompt here.

1249
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,670
It's using the code
interpreter to perform these.

1250
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:53,580
And tomorrow if your
business requirement changes,

1251
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,220
you can come here and change
it in the prompt itself.

1252
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,780
It's not the supervisor agent

1253
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,770
which is doing that.

1254
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,540
Here we have purpose built agents

1255
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,250
for each of these functions.

1256
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,650
And when you want to change
any of these functions,

1257
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:07,860
you can come to those purpose built agents

1258
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,327
and change the prompt there,

1259
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,237
and your newer business
logic would come into play.

1260
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,280
- [Mrudhula] And do you want to show them

1261
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,220
a code that they can go to?

1262
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,120
We want to give you something actionable

1263
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,970
so that as you walk out of the room today,

1264
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,763
you have something to go build.

1265
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,350
So we have a couple of official repos.

1266
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:36,350
One is the Strands Agents
itself which contains,

1267
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,400
it's a GitHub repo

1268
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,010
that contains all the
different design patterns

1269
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,557
that you can build with.

1270
00:59:43,557 --> 00:59:45,120
A2A is one of them that we used

1271
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,560
for today's solution.

1272
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,600
And then another official GitHub repo

1273
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,490
for Bedrock AgentCore.

1274
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:54,600
It's a really rich set of code samples.

1275
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,630
We based a lot of our solution

1276
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,600
based on those code samples

1277
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,270
that are in Bedrock AgentCore repo.

1278
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,583
So please use those.

1279
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,200
They just accelerate your
entire development process.

1280
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,680
These are vetted solutions

1281
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,540
meant for building secure,

1282
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,850
scalable agentic AI application.

1283
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,923
So go have fun with those,

1284
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:24,030
and definitely give Kiro a try.

1285
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,310
It's been very helpful for us.

1286
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,143
- [Murali] And thank you.

1287
01:00:27,143 --> 01:00:29,280
Thank you so much for listening to us.

1288
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,390
Hope you liked this.
(audience applauding)

1289
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,573
And we are available outside
the room for any questions.
