1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,923
- Hey everybody, I'm Alex Hatcher.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,790
I'm with Slalom, and I'm a part
of our AWS Cloud capability.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,060
And today, let's see, it looks
like we're a slide ahead.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,120
Today we're gonna be
talking about our approach

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,069
to accelerating legacy modernization.

6
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:23,051
So throughout the talk,
what we're gonna cover,

7
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:25,830
our Zero Legacy campaign.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,700
For our clients, we're
seeing that modernization

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,513
is a strategic importance, and
it's important to us as well.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,690
So we'll cover that.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,189
We will also discuss our,
like, what we're seeing

12
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:43,410
in the landscape and
with our clients today.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,170
We'll see some of the challenges
that our clients are facing

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,260
and some of the opportunities
that come out of that.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,840
You know, we're also really
excited about a customer

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,100
like our most recent public
customer story with La-Z-Boy,

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,570
where we were able to
move them to Zero Legacy

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,180
by retiring their Z Series mainframe.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,730
So, looking forward to
telling you more about that.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,300
Zero Legacy.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,790
So first off, what is legacy exactly?

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,790
To us, we see legacy, like
a legacy system is anything

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,747
that you have to change,
that you have to look at,

24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,747
or that is a barrier to modernization.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,110
So like, or innovating in
the way that you want to.

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,210
So like, I think we've probably
all been in that situation,

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,240
or a lot of us have,
where we're like, hey,

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,610
like, the product team wants to innovate.

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,690
We wanna see something new.

30
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,830
We want to, we see an
opportunity for our business,

31
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,100
but then when it comes to
a technical discussion,

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,210
we start to see, oh,

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,180
but we've gotta touch
this, you know, system X.

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,930
And if we do that, everybody
kind of starts to pull back

35
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,340
and we kind of see that idea

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,290
or that creativity die on the vine

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,970
right there in that moment.

38
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,850
To us, like that's really
what our Zero Legacy campaign

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,950
is about, is solving that problem.

40
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,040
We wanna move you into a
position where you're able

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,980
to think creatively, be imaginative,

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,980
and not have the drag of legacy
on your, like in your space.

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,913
So.

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,130
So, let's see.

45
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,240
So a key qualifier that we see

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,240
for a lot of legacy systems,
typically they're monolithic,

47
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,563
typically they're stateful.

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,280
Typically what we see
in modern architectures

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,970
is that they are microservice,
so non-monolithic,

50
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,810
and that they're stateless.

51
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,820
So there's a need for us

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,950
to kind of make like a paradigm shift

53
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,110
between the two overall.

54
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,101
And mainframe specifically is, you know,

55
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:55,101
like z/OS AS/400 workloads
are very stateful,

56
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:58,680
very monolithic and centralized.

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,400
So, you know, that's kind of
like a key candidate for us.

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,220
Like, it is in a part of
our strategic initiative

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,353
in terms of what we wanna modernize.

60
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,680
You know, what we're
hearing from our clients

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,263
in this space is that the.

62
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,580
What we're hearing from
our clients in this space

63
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,630
is that like their costs are rising

64
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,950
and that it's difficult to hire.

65
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,040
I'll give you an example
of one of our clients

66
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,752
in the gov space is, so
the original developers

67
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:34,328
of their mainframe hire,
they trained their children

68
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:38,831
to actually be able to maintain the system

69
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,560
after they're retired.

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,430
So it's a very real scenario
for them where, you know,

71
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,680
Dad is like on the beach
getting a phone call from his

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,860
daughter who's saying,
hey, I'm in the COBOL code.

73
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,030
I see you in the comments.

74
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,620
What were you thinking here?

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,660
You know, like when we modified this

76
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,440
or when we created that.

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,680
So that, like, to me, that says,

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,710
our clients are being
extremely creative about

79
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,640
how they are trying to
solve that skills problem

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,830
of these legacy technologies.

81
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,630
So we see that the problem
is there, but so why now?

82
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,580
You know, and we see the
pressure from, you know,

83
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,030
like the cost and the timing overall.

84
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,840
But what's like, you know,
what's kind of moving us forward?

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,940
And AI is a big component of that,

86
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,370
probably no surprises for anybody.

87
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,110
What we're seeing in the AI
space, like these mainframes,

88
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,110
you know, or AS/400 legacy
systems kind of have their,

89
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:44,269
the being able to access
the code, the data.

90
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,310
Monitoring real-time information is more

91
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,380
of a black box than anything
that we're gonna deal with,

92
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,390
like in a cloud environment where we're

93
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,000
like heavily monitored
in a microservice level.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,740
So Generative AI has been
extremely good at allowing us

95
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,360
to reverse engineer those systems

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,910
and in a way that we never have before.

97
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,070
So what we used to do in
those systems is we would have

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,020
numerous solution architects

99
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,520
that would descend on a large
code base, describe that,

100
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,030
then synthesize higher
understandings of that code base,

101
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,030
build diagrams, and then, you
know, get feedback on that

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
to validate what they're finding.

103
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,480
And that's extremely labor
intensive, it's extremely costly,

104
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,720
but what we're, you know,
and what GenAI has opened up

105
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,990
for us is what we can do
now is we could provision

106
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,310
a Kendra index.

107
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,610
We could provision a
Bedrock knowledge base,

108
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,380
and we can essentially zip up
our code, load it into that,

109
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,280
into an S3 bucket, index it with Kendra.

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,800
And then access our
knowledge base through an MCP

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,860
and like Q Developer or Q CLI,

112
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,250
and we're able pretty
much with within an hour

113
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,600
to start asking questions about
our code to understand it.

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
That can support a process where
we can start documenting it

115
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,510
and open that up with
a very little overhead.

116
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,820
So I think just that in itself,

117
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,160
the ability to like use Generative AI

118
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,680
to assist in the re-engineering process

119
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,453
is really driving us forward.

120
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,740
So we're using Generative AI

121
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,600
in our modernization in
a few different ways.

122
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,440
We've already touched on the
reverse engineering process

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,640
and how we're able to really open up

124
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,050
like these legacy
systems and describe them

125
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,100
and understand them in a way

126
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,000
that we really never have been before.

127
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,100
We're also, we're still
seeing productivity gains

128
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,960
from using Generative AI just to augment

129
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,420
like our traditional SDLC process.

130
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,990
So now imagine I'm using
my preferred coding agent,

131
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,140
which is definitely gonna be Q or Q CLI.

132
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,560
And now what I'm able to
do, not only am I able

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
to just use the default model,

134
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,810
which we've all seen is like
a great productivity increase.

135
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,540
But now we're again able
to bring that context of

136
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,960
that legacy code into that
process where we can still use

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,130
that, you know, to augment
our traditional SDLC

138
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,060
with tremendous productivity
gains, like usually about 30%

139
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,090
and sometimes more depending
on the problem space.

140
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,090
So now let's look at our
forward engineering process.

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,360
So if we're able to, like
we see that we're able

142
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,420
to describe these systems,
we're able to extract

143
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,180
that knowledge from them.

144
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,509
We're also now, like we've seen really,

145
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,736
really great advancements with spec-driven

146
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:53,310
development toolkits like Kiro, Kiro CLI.

147
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,020
That announcement that just came out

148
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,920
where there's opportunity now for us

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,340
to lean into the future,

150
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,290
which could be spec-driven
development supported by,

151
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,290
like by what we're able to extract

152
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:12,570
in our reverse engineering process.

153
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,080
So like, just to try to paint
a bit of a picture of that,

154
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,230
not only are we able like
through like to use Generative AI

155
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,910
to kind of get those like a
high level domain explanation

156
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,500
of what the system does,

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,680
but we're also able to
decompose those domains

158
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,400
and we're also able to look at and define

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
and see the execution paths

160
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,430
of the functions that we need to do,

161
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,290
or the subroutines that
need to be executed

162
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,170
to achieve a task from end-to-end.

163
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,890
And, you know, if, you know,
if we're thinking about it,

164
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,320
it's kind of like that's very
similar to what we think of

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,290
as a microservice, a single execution path

166
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,880
of a single function.

167
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,099
And so with context

168
00:08:56,099 --> 00:09:00,270
and with that fully documented
as a part of our process,

169
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,060
like we start to move into
territory where it makes sense

170
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,380
and it's completely possible
to do a more of a spec-driven

171
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,260
development process that's bringing all of

172
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,100
that information into context
with, again, full traceability

173
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,740
of that specification
back to the original code.

174
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,153
So we can validate as we go.

175
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,360
So, so far we've talked
a lot about technology,

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,283
and technology is extremely important,

177
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,510
but I think the one thing
that we really do at Slalom

178
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,840
that we do really well is that we look at,

179
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,100
we connect with our clients

180
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,810
and we meet them where they're at.

181
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,810
So it's not just about like,
we could go, you know, like we,

182
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,340
I've seen, what we've seen
from our clients in some cases

183
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,610
is they may say, hey, our mainframe

184
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,540
or our AS/400 is a, that's
an IT that's owned by IT.

185
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,500
And so we kind of own the
trajectory of that service.

186
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,630
Or maybe a product organization says,

187
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,340
hey, I wanna do something

188
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,600
totally different than what we're doing.

189
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,590
And they peel off

190
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,660
and go in a completely
different direction.

191
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,260
We have not really seen
that be successful.

192
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,930
What's necessary is that
we get everybody aligned

193
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,968
because we, at the end of the day,

194
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,720
like that legacy system is at the core,

195
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,570
and it's been there more than
likely for a few decades.

196
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,120
Business processes have
built up around that.

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,470
Business processes have built up

198
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,300
around those business processes.

199
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,680
And we can't simply just rip

200
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,250
that out without causing
massive business disruption.

201
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,350
And that's usually where we
see a lot of that failure.

202
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,130
So in our approach, we
want to pull together

203
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,300
all of our stakeholders,

204
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,170
build alignment across
our client organization,

205
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,770
and then based on that, we're
able to define a strategy

206
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,180
that works for everybody

207
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,920
that's focused on the key outcomes

208
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,820
that collectively we all want to meet.

209
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:02,669
So this is our La-Z-Boy,

210
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:06,570
our story that we're
extremely excited about this.

211
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,288
Like, so when we started with La-Z-Boy,

212
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:15,869
and we talked to them originally
in a half-day workshop,

213
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:18,360
they mentioned that they had a mainframe

214
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,670
and we said, oh, let's
talk more about that.

215
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,080
And they were resistant.

216
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,780
It was kind of like, hey,
we've tried to modernize this,

217
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,490
we've tried to work with
this a few different times.

218
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,410
We've gone through a few different passes.

219
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,940
We've got a team that's working on it

220
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,190
and they're kind of slowly
chipping away at it,

221
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,280
but we said, you know, let's
at least have the conversation

222
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,770
and let's talk about what's possible.

223
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,310
And as we went through, we kind
of realized that, you know,

224
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,220
there's some real opportunity
here for transformation

225
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,349
and like bringing our AWS expertise along

226
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:50,730
with the changes of Generative AI,

227
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,793
which they had not incorporated
into their process at time.

228
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,780
Opened up some doors and
opened up the ability for us

229
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,810
to do an AWS-funded assessment to look at

230
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,730
like what they currently had.

231
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,699
We mapped the dependency,
like first we got the code,

232
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,699
we used Amazon Q just to look
at it and fully understand it.

233
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,070
We were able to map the
dependencies to third party,

234
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,365
like any sort of external systems

235
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:22,200
that surrounded that core batch work,

236
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,020
the core batch workloads
that they were working on.

237
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,870
And so we were able to kind
of map out the full ecosystem.

238
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,050
And then from that we were able
to identify key stakeholders

239
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,450
for each one of those
parts of the organization,

240
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,730
engage them, get them involved.

241
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,050
So we got everyone together

242
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,400
and said, hey, is this
something that we want to do?

243
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
Like we can show you a path.

244
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,860
Like do we wanna make this real?

245
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,860
And, you know, we did it,
like we moved forward.

246
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,150
And so we moved forward
into a mobilized phase.

247
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,410
We used Q to accelerate our
infrastructure deployment.

248
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,440
We used Q as well to,

249
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,371
you know, to start
building out step functions

250
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:05,460
to replace the JCL for the jobs.

251
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,460
To, we used, we transformed
the COBOL into Python

252
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,070
and we deployed those as ECS tasks

253
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,830
and we modernized their DB2 environment

254
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,950
to a modern Aurora Postgres environment.

255
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,880
So we scaled out, like,
so during mobilize,

256
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,130
we used a subset of the workloads

257
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,570
just to prove out that process.

258
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,730
And then we went to full migrate,

259
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,760
we modernized the full set of workloads.

260
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,880
So at that point, we
were production-ready,

261
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,280
but we still, we had
built a testing process

262
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,620
to ensure that we had
functional equivalence

263
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,540
before we went into a full go live

264
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,610
state with decommissioning.

265
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,900
So at that point, we
basically set up this process

266
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,610
that could compare DB2
and Postgres and the data,

267
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,160
like as those jobs ran in synchronization,

268
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,140
and we saw some bugs that we fixed.

269
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,680
But I think one of the things
that is the most interesting

270
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,480
to me about this process
is that there were,

271
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,630
we found bugs that they never knew existed

272
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,050
that required us to rethink
some business processes.

273
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,260
And that was new for the
organization to, like,

274
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,850
that's the first time
that we're like, hey,

275
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,140
we're in this new world.

276
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,850
We're in this cloud world

277
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,580
where instead of stepping
away from the table

278
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,890
and saying, this is just
something we can't work with,

279
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,350
it's like, hey, not only
can we change this code,

280
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,560
we can change this process
here right now, you know.

281
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,818
But what else can we change?

282
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:39,540
What other processes can we modernize?

283
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,273
And to us, that's the
power of Zero Legacy.

284
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:46,800
I really appreciate you,
thank you so much for my talk.

285
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,633
I'm with Slalom.

286
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,550
Again, we're at Booth 625.

287
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,900
Love to have you join me over there

288
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,490
to continue the conversation.

289
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,657
Thank you so much.

290
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:57,824
(audience applauding)
