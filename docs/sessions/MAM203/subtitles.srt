1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,370
- AWS for VMware migrations:

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,130
successes, roadmaps, and strategies.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,340
I'm thrilled to be joined today
by three of our customers.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,743
We have Tyler Barhydt,

5
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:13,680
he's the VP of Cloud and
Infrastructure Delivery

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,350
at Envision Healthcare.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,440
Angel Gonzalez, Deputy
Director of Infrastructure

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,030
for Aeroméxico.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,320
And Molly Greek,

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,060
the Chief Information Officer

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,460
at the University of California.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,570
Thank you all for being here,

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,303
I'm really looking forward
to our discussion today.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,780
Now, before we hear from these leaders,

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,850
I'd like to point out that AWS

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,370
is the longest standing Cloud provider

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,360
helping customers migrate
VMware workloads to the Cloud.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,780
We understand that there's
no one size fits all solution

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,690
when it comes to Cloud
migration and modernization.

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,170
Each organization has its own unique mix

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,560
of applications and data and
infrastructure requirements,

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,863
which is why we offer customers
choice and flexibility.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,610
Some customers may be
running VMware workloads,

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,970
which have dependencies

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,140
that they need to continue
running in the Cloud.

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,891
Others are seeking to transform workloads

27
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:18,090
through modernization,
migration and modernization,

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,310
leveraging Cloud native technologies.

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,130
Some customers have data
residency requirements,

30
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,060
where running AWS on premises
can help meet that objective.

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,560
And finally, some may be looking

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,310
to expand how they
virtualize their workloads,

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,353
perhaps leveraging partner solutions.

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,680
And diving a little bit deeper into this,

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,710
just AWS meets you where you
are in your Cloud journey.

36
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,080
We offer the most comprehensive migration

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,010
and modernization pathways
for your VMware workloads.

38
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,550
Customers can relocate VMware
workloads with Amazon EVS.

39
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,800
That's our Elastic VMware Service

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,433
for a rapid lift and shift
with minimal changes.

41
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,890
You can rehost on Amazon
EC2, leveraging AWS transform

42
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,890
for VMware to accelerate migrations.

43
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,690
You may have heard that we just launched

44
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,333
enhanced agentic AI capabilities.

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,660
This helps automate discovery,

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,510
dependency mapping, and
network translation.

47
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,510
We have a couple of breakout
sessions on AWS transform

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,130
for VMware later this week.

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll have information at
the end of the presentation

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,670
about those sessions,

51
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,450
so be sure to check those
out if you're interested.

52
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,340
Customers can also re-platform
to containers with Amazon ECS

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,870
or Amazon EKS to modernize
the application architecture.

54
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,460
And you could leverage managed
services such as Amazon RDS,

55
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,030
Amazon FSX, or Amazon Workspaces.

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,000
This will help you reduce
operational overhead,

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,220
or you could completely refactor

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,590
and modernize applications with serverless

59
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,590
and Cloud native services
for maximum agility

60
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,810
and cost optimization.

61
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,800
Now these pathways are
not mutually exclusive.

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,700
Many customers pursue multiple
approaches simultaneously

63
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,080
and continue to iterate

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,110
long after the first
migration is complete.

65
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, I'm curious to
hear from the audience,

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,580
how many of you are
considering a migration

67
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,250
of VMware workloads to the Cloud

68
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,240
through either with EVS or EC2?

69
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,373
Show of hands, it's a lot of you.

70
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,180
What about how many are
looking to modernize workloads

71
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,670
through moving to containers
or managed services

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,690
and application refactoring?

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,680
Great, so a lot of you,

74
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,700
think you should be very interested

75
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,173
in the conversation today.

76
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,620
Now let's get to know our
speakers a little bit better.

77
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,910
Tyler, can you start us off

78
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,800
and tell us a little bit
about Envision Healthcare

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,270
and your responsibilities there?

80
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,860
- Sure, like you mentioned,

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm the VP of our Cloud
and Infrastructure Delivery

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
at Envision Healthcare.

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,810
About 25 years of IT experience

84
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,090
in various forms over the years.

85
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,380
Been there about two and a half years.

86
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,670
And we focus in on the
physicians EMHM type work.

87
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,280
We've got kind of an interesting model

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,930
where we actually staff physicians.

89
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,570
We do our revenue cycle
management work for them,

90
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,500
as well as scheduling

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,360
and some other things are on EMHM,

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,030
anesthesiology, radiology, et cetera.

93
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,200
- Great, now, Angel,

94
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,300
could you tell us a little
bit about Aeroméxico,

95
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,770
and your responsibilities?

96
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,570
- Sure, well, my name is Angel Gonzalez,

97
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,530
as you already mentioned.

98
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,830
Aeroméxico is one of the
largest airlines in Mexico.

99
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,700
We fly to over 90 destinations
in Mexico, Europe,

100
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,650
United States, and Asia.

101
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,750
Well, I'm the Deputy
Director of Infrastructure,

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,700
so I'm in charge of several parts there,

103
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,270
like Cloud, on-Prem services,
network, and several others.

104
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,763
So we've been in this
journey to the Cloud here

105
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:44,640
for years, more or less.

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,829
So, well, that's me.

107
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,970
- All right, thank you very much.

108
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,040
And Molly, could you give
us a brief introduction

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,900
and overview of your responsibilities

110
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,700
at the University of California?

111
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,560
- Sure, I've been at the
University of California

112
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,850
for about 15 years.

113
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,070
I used to work at UC Davis Health,

114
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,720
and now I work at the systemwide office,

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
which is in Oakland.

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,210
Many of you probably didn't know

117
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,250
there was a systemwide office,

118
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,650
but to just give you an idea
about the scope and scale,

119
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,070
we provide shared services
for the entire UC,

120
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,870
which is 22 different organizations,

121
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,330
including a large healthcare presence.

122
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,450
And we do things like the
undergraduate admission system

123
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,890
for the entire UC,

124
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,610
which 250,000 students
apply every year, worldwide.

125
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,970
We also have all the
hospitals that we support,

126
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,520
health systems, we have
six major health systems,

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,070
and we have the payroll and HR system

128
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,180
for our current employees,

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,840
which is, UC is the second
largest employer in California.

130
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,840
And we have the HR and
payroll and benefits system

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,510
for all of our retirees, as
well because we have a pension.

132
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,683
- Thank you very much.

133
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,640
I apologize I didn't have the slide up

134
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,227
about the University of
California the whole time,

135
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,800
so we'll leave that just for a second.

136
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay, well, thank you all.

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,150
I think everyone here is
looking forward to hearing more

138
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,390
from our panelists as they
share their experiences.

139
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,940
Tyler, why don't you start us
off with Envision Healthcare.

140
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,550
Tell us about your migration story.

141
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,490
- Yeah, when I showed
up about, like I said,

142
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,380
about two and a half years ago.

143
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,730
We have on-prem infrastructure,

144
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,520
we have got a Cloud,
small Cloud footprint,

145
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,620
radiology was there, pretty heavy.

146
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,490
We had a lot of acquisition work,

147
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,600
a lot of M&A activity that
created a lot of fragmentation.

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
We had 11 plus data centers that were,

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,310
I'll say purpose built,

150
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,510
so not a lot of that traditional,

151
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,190
where we were doing, running all workloads

152
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,057
and all data centers and that.

153
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:38,340
And so we really had to
come up with an approach

154
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,970
that would allow us to kinda
get into a Cloud first mindset,

155
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,960
how do we start to migrate?

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,180
And our end goal being,
you know, flexible.

157
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,330
So we didn't like narrow
down AWS as our primary.

158
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,300
We have a few workloads that
run over in Azure as well.

159
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
But we tried to stay
very open in, kind of,

160
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,860
our methodologies and where we could go.

161
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,730
We really wanted to
focus in on consolidation

162
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,290
of those data centers.

163
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,310
How do we get through that?

164
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,130
How do we start to build some
operational efficiencies?

165
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,410
And then how do we also gain
some, you know, cost savings

166
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,430
and some of the other benefits

167
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,370
that you're gonna get through
that migration effort?

168
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,980
We leverage different tools
right there, up there,

169
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,940
transform our application
discovery services, EC2s,

170
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,320
RDS customs and everything else.

171
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,310
And so in the early days we
focused in a little bit on,

172
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,033
kind of, our SQL workloads,
getting into RDS, RDS custom.

173
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,890
We tried to, one of those
data centers I mentioned,

174
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,500
we were able to exit in 2025.

175
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,990
Some of that was data center
to data center migration.

176
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,480
Some of it was, again, being flexible,

177
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,050
moving things directly into
AWS, more of a lift and shift.

178
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,000
And then we also went through an effort

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,770
to migrate a bunch of
workloads to Azure ABS.

180
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,370
Is what we ended up using there.

181
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,300
We've got plans now,

182
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,840
we're looking to get out
of our last, kind of,

183
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,960
there's two more primary data
centers left from that 11.

184
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,850
We look to get out of that
by the end of this year,

185
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,300
we're probably gonna leak
a little bit into 2027.

186
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
But the tools and those things
were very useful in, kind of,

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
how we organized the environment,

188
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,240
those different methodologies
and things that we did there,

189
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,140
again, really focused on

190
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,140
how do we take the right
workloads, get them-

191
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,850
Initially we started out
with a little bit of the,

192
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,310
hey, we gotta modernize everything.

193
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,080
That slowed us down.

194
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,220
We kind of got ahead of
ourselves a little bit

195
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,590
and kind of moved things back and forth,

196
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,030
changed our policies a little bit

197
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,830
and kind of kept things moving, but-

198
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,080
- [Blankenstein] Did you have any-

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,510
Were there any AWS workshops

200
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,450
or anything like that that
kinda helped you along the way?

201
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,540
- Yeah, we did, we did.

202
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,630
Our two EBAs, which were very helpful.

203
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,253
- [Blankenstein] That's the
Experience Based Acceleration.

204
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:51,840
- Yep, thank you.

205
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,920
We did a couple of those.

206
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,260
We did one earlier this year
that was also very helpful,

207
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,240
so that's always been very useful to us.

208
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,220
We've done work,

209
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,870
and we've had a partner involved along

210
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,820
with AWS, so Presidio is our
partner there with you guys.

211
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,653
That's really, kind of,

212
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:07,650
helped us put some structure around it,

213
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,150
but we really brought in folks

214
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,798
and dedicated it to this effort.

215
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:16,320
We spent a lot of time up front,

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't wanna get into the
lesson learnt piece yet,

217
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,713
so lemme-
- [Blankenstein] That's okay.

218
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:19,983
- Keep going on the journey.

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,140
The tooling and everything,
again, was very useful.

220
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,780
We did have to push folks
to kind of adopt it.

221
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,620
A lot of work around, we
had two organizations,

222
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,770
the on-prem folks and the Cloud folks.

223
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,200
We're all now part of one organization.

224
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,430
We leveraged Skill Builder,

225
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,590
we leveraged a lot of that
partnership with you guys on,

226
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,850
kind of, the efforts that we did there

227
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,360
to really kind of upskill
folks as we went along the way.

228
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,723
Deep down, I think it's been, you know,

229
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,600
a very positive journey and partnership

230
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,612
with how this works,

231
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:50,973
- Great, great.

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Angel, you wanna take us through
your journey at Aeroméxico?

233
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,140
- Sure, well, this journey
started like four years ago.

234
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,940
One of the main strategies for Aeroméxico

235
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,980
was not doing lift and shift, per se.

236
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,920
We needed to make, first, an architecture.

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,820
This structure had everything
on, set on the paper.

238
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,240
Just to start moving and really
modernizing our application.

239
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,760
So we started dividing our applications.

240
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,500
All of our applications were based

241
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,990
on three main data centers.

242
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,400
The idea is to leave all these
three centers from premise

243
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,753
and go fully Cloud.

244
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,230
As Tyler has mentioned,

245
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,170
we are moving to only one Cloud, only AWS.

246
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,790
So that's one of our strategies.

247
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,963
So, we were planning, one of the goals

248
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:41,940
were to move 346, 350 applications

249
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,680
out of those data centers.

250
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,470
So we divided our strategies
in three, at the beginning,

251
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,020
or mainly two, refactor and re-platform

252
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,630
for our critical workloads.

253
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,620
And then we started like
looking to different options.

254
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,130
During this journey, we ended
up having some of obsolescence

255
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,730
and a major tech refresh came up for us.

256
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,030
So we decided to start
looking to options with AWS,

257
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,310
with some assessment
that you help us with,

258
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,290
and with a service that
you called Countdown,

259
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,960
also with some specialists
that you present to us,

260
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,474
- [Blankenstein] Countdown Premium, yeah.

261
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,420
- Into EVS.

262
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,360
So when we decided, here, to go to EVS

263
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,850
was because one of the main purposes here

264
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,130
is that our business partners

265
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,890
that were focused on
refactoring other applications,

266
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,030
they needed to focus on that.

267
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,500
So my team, as infrastructure,

268
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,820
we decided to take this
application that was left on-prem

269
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,520
that will take maybe 12 months to be moved

270
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,170
from on-premise to Cloud.

271
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,990
So, and one of them,
a couple of challenges

272
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,823
that we have there

273
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,460
is that they wanted to keep
our IP addressing in the Cloud.

274
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,580
So they don't have to make
any changes or major changes

275
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,690
to the applications.

276
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,370
And also we needed to improve some,

277
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,980
and start covering some
vulnerabilities in cybersecurity,

278
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,650
that our cybersecurity team showed to us.

279
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,370
So we took EVS, we started analyzing,

280
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,710
we start talking to our business partner

281
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,160
to try knowing how they are
handling their applications.

282
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,709
And one of our partners, DXC,

283
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,490
that is the one that is managing

284
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,200
all our on-premise applications,

285
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,730
helped us really, really well

286
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,463
because they were really
novel about the infrastructure

287
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,960
that we have there.

288
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,510
So we started looking into that.

289
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,880
It was like a flip coin to be honest,

290
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,700
because we put all our force there in EVS

291
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,010
and at the end it came really well.

292
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,870
We ended up moving 96 servers,

293
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,200
around more than 50
applications in only one month.

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,330
So it was really, really well for us.

295
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,473
And at the beginning,

296
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:37,200
just the goal was to move those loads

297
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,670
really, really fast to the Cloud.

298
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,593
But at the end we end up finding,

299
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,890
also more capacity for our service

300
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,500
in operational applications that we have.

301
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,200
Also, we end up finding
that some of our workloads

302
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,450
and applications started
running really, really fast.

303
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,070
So the feedback that we received

304
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,560
from our customers were really good.

305
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,393
- Not too fast.

306
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:57,420
- Not fast, but really, really good.

307
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,750
So WIN has performance,
WIN has cybersecurity,

308
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,860
WIN has a lot of things.

309
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,370
And, well, now we are running
a lot of our workloads.

310
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,890
Of course, we will talk a little
bit in the lessons learned,

311
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,600
but we have a couple of roadblocks.

312
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
- So it sounded like a key
thing that you were able to do

313
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,210
was to move the infrastructure
without disruption

314
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,980
to the application development.

315
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,794
And you did that with EVS

316
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:21,420
and the HCX technology
to stretch the networks?

317
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,520
- Correct, HCX, we extended our network,

318
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,630
our on-prem network,

319
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,030
and we end up moving the
workloads during night.

320
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,650
So no operational impact.

321
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,970
We are of course an airline,

322
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,550
so 24/7 support in our operations.

323
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,730
So with no impact, no impacts whatsoever

324
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,190
for our clients and our customers.

325
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,580
- Great, I know you were
an early adopter of EVS

326
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,630
and we thank you for that

327
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,920
and your feedback through all that.

328
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,480
So I'm glad it's working out

329
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,033
and helping with the rapid
lift and shift there.

330
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,610
All right, Molly,

331
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,190
I know you had some interesting
application challenges

332
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,290
to deal with at University of California.

333
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,790
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that

334
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,080
and your journey?

335
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,930
- Yeah, I wish my
journey was so strategic.

336
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,270
What we started with was emergencies

337
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,250
that we had to deal with right away.

338
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,245
So, we had an HR payroll system

339
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,410
that serves about 280,000 employees.

340
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,150
And we had a lot of performance issues.

341
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,790
It was being managed by a vendor

342
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,520
and it was being managed
on a different platform.

343
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,440
And we tried to get it to be fixed,

344
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,760
we tried to get it better.

345
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,670
But every single time we
ran payroll, it took longer.

346
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,500
And we were really looking at the point

347
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,900
where at some point we wouldn't
be able to run it on time.

348
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,420
So that was the point
where we said enough,

349
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,280
we have to move to AWS.

350
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,720
So we moved the system over.

351
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,610
It took us about six months.

352
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,050
We worked really, really
closely with our AWS partners.

353
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,970
And you know, it's always nervous

354
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,410
when you do those types of things, right?

355
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,880
It's payroll.

356
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,250
We didn't, and we have a
lot of people that we pay.

357
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,670
If you don't get that right,
you're in the newspapers.

358
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,720
But we moved it over

359
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,146
and all of our performance problems, gone.

360
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,940
It was absolutely amazing.

361
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,430
I actually had the other
vendor call me the day after

362
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,720
and say, how's it going?

363
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,210
And I say, "Hey, all those
problems we used to have,

364
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,030
I guess it really was the
infrastructure all the time."

365
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,460
So really big success there.

366
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,350
And then we had some
other things that came up.

367
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,880
Like we have the undergraduate
admission system, which is,

368
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,260
if you ever have dealt with someone

369
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,730
who's applying for college,

370
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,380
everybody likes to wait until
the last 15 minutes to hit go.

371
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,470
So we have 250,000 applicants every year.

372
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,780
And we close at midnight, actually coming,

373
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,640
I think it might be today.

374
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,600
Last 15 minutes, about
15,000 people hit enter

375
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
and two years in a row,

376
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,950
our system crashed in
that last 15 minutes.

377
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,320
And so then we're in all the newspapers,

378
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,890
all the parents and the
students are panicking.

379
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,840
We have to extend the deadline.

380
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,120
And the president of the university said,

381
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,770
I don't care what you do,

382
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,050
but it can't happen in
the third year in a row.

383
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,250
We tried a lot of things,

384
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,540
a lot of performance management stuff.

385
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,120
But this is a classic
thing where it's down here

386
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,200
and then it's up here

387
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,210
and then it's down here
the rest of the time.

388
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,240
You just can't put enough
servers together for that.

389
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,230
So that one we partnered
with AWS, got it up there.

390
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,150
And what the really cool
thing about that is,

391
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,280
they wanted it to succeed
as much as we did.

392
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,000
You know, they were up
with us at, you know, 11:59

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,680
adjusting dials and all that stuff.

394
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,960
And, actually, even now,
it's our third year there,

395
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,090
they're still with us
at midnight, you know,

396
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,950
making sure it goes well.

397
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,893
We also, following that, we
had to get off the mainframe.

398
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,150
I know, we had a mainframe,
so we moved off the mainframe.

399
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,640
It was very expensive
to be on a mainframe,

400
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,020
if anyone has ever been on a mainframe

401
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,760
or maybe still on a mainframe.

402
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,730
And we had data that we had to keep.

403
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,380
We have some retention things,

404
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,530
we have to either keep
data for 50 or 99 years,

405
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,583
that's another story.

406
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,510
But we moved it all to AWS and
we turned off the mainframe

407
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,010
and saved $3 million.

408
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,060
And that was one where we worked

409
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,440
with Deloitte to get that done.

410
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,110
They're actually pretty good
at turning off mainframes.

411
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,890
And, you know, after we had
all these different successes,

412
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,220
then we just said enough, we
wanna just be on one platform.

413
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,070
So we started a project
to move everything else

414
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,270
and really, really lucky

415
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,190
because that was right about the time

416
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,470
that the VMware stuff was changing.

417
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,890
And we had a plan to get it all done

418
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,160
in a certain period of time.

419
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,410
We had to accelerate that at the end

420
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,380
to avoid the VMware costs, which we did.

421
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,140
And now we are a hundred percent in AWS.

422
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,900
And, you know, I think that
you really have to know

423
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,733
what you're doing there.

424
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,600
We'll talk more about lessons learned,

425
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,670
but we worked with partners
and, at this point,

426
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,810
our team is so good

427
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,250
because we've done it so many times

428
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,350
that we're a lot more comfortable with it.

429
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,550
- I think you mentioned you had
some security things as well

430
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,477
that you were trying to -

431
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,190
- Oh yeah, you know, one
thing I'll mention, you know,

432
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,510
it's not something I'm super proud of,

433
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,640
but I guess we're okay now.

434
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,170
When we moved everything over,

435
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,790
just by moving everything through,

436
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,850
we resolved about 60,000 vulnerabilities.

437
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,323
So that's just an important
thing to think about.

438
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,690
It's like we're getting
better performance.

439
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,090
We actually were able to reduce cost

440
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,570
and we resolved a lot of our
software vulnerabilities.

441
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,490
Part of that is, you know,

442
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,020
the fact that they're managing it for us,

443
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,610
so we don't have to constantly be patching

444
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,020
and patching and patching.

445
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,400
The other piece of it is,

446
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,060
it forced us to look at
everything on those servers.

447
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm not gonna lie, there
was some old stuff on there

448
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,930
and we didn't know what it was.

449
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,353
So, you know, we had things out there

450
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:18,750
that had been there for 15 years.

451
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,587
We didn't know what it was,

452
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:22,320
but we had to go through
and figure it all out.

453
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,050
We had about 15 zombie servers

454
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,940
running stuff we didn't even need.

455
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,830
So by going through that

456
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,790
and getting rid of that stuff,

457
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,580
we reduced our security
vulnerability footprint

458
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,620
and we reduced cost.

459
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,970
- Fantastic.

460
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,380
Great, great stories.

461
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,840
And I think everyone's
gonna benefit from that.

462
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,830
We like to transition now to
our lessons learned section.

463
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,110
I think the audience would
love to hear from each of you

464
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,340
a little bit about some of the,

465
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,050
maybe the challenges
you had along the way,

466
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,390
and just, basically,
how you resolved those

467
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,950
and things you'd like to share.

468
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,180
Tyler, you wanna start us off?

469
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,186
- [Barhydt] Sure, yeah.

470
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:58,200
One of our big ones was really,

471
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,880
because of that fragmentation I mentioned,

472
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,773
we had a lot of those lost toys.

473
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,743
15, that's nothing.

474
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:08,730
And we had a ton of
stuff in the environment

475
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,320
that we just didn't know either,

476
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,670
what it was, what was on it,

477
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,020
it had been there for a long time.

478
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,310
It was, you know,

479
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,380
one person using an
application, et cetera.

480
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,940
And so, really, kind of,
understanding that the ecosystem,

481
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,560
whether you have a good CMDB or not,

482
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,540
or you just, you need something to come in

483
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,220
and help with discovery.

484
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,220
It was, we were able to
identify a ton of prior retains

485
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
and we, I mean, we ran into
the same VMware cost thing.

486
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,395
So we reduced from about
05,000 cores down to 22

487
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:44,760
in about nine months just through
those efforts of, kind of,

488
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,150
re-pushing and really driving
from an IT perspective

489
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,640
into the application
owners in the business

490
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
and calling out like, okay,
do you really need it?

491
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,170
'Cause their first answer was always yes.

492
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,290
And I mean, we identified
and, again, AS400 stuff

493
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,490
that had been out there for a while.

494
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,810
We just kept pushing.

495
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,170
So it was almost like, don't
take retain as the first answer

496
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,300
or don't take their first
answer as the truth.

497
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,560
You've gotta push on it.

498
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,320
Which seems a little
weird sometimes from IT

499
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,800
of where we're pushing the business

500
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,633
on the need of their applications.

501
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,990
- [Blankenstein] Were you
empowered to make those decisions?

502
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,473
- We were, we, you know,
we partnered with them.

503
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,780
Probably shouldn't say it out loud,

504
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,230
sometimes I'm looking for
the illusion of choice,

505
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,060
and some of those conversations,

506
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,370
but little bit of that
leading them to the,

507
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,330
hey, here's where we're headed

508
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,130
and here's what we're gonna do.

509
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,200
- [Blankenstein] But a
common vision is, ultimately,

510
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,850
what you were after.
- [Barhydt] Yes, yeah, yeah.

511
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,290
- [Blankenstein] Angel, you
wanna share a few things?

512
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,760
- Yeah, I think, well, for us,

513
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,860
the main challenge was at
the beginning, time, right?

514
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,663
Because we decided to use EVS,

515
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,220
we came up with the idea of EVS this year.

516
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,520
We planted it this year and
we executed it this year.

517
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,560
So the time was really,
really challenging.

518
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,600
And we needed to talk
with cybersecurity teams,

519
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,030
with architectures team
to see how this will work.

520
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,000
And then contact our partner, DXC,

521
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,360
start looking into the
solution, how we'll work,

522
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,230
how do we connect,

523
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,410
how do we extend this
VLAN and this connectivity

524
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,810
to the EVS environment

525
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,760
and start looking into all these pieces

526
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,920
and then taking the teams together

527
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,650
and see how their applications run,

528
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,110
if they will have some
concerns, if they don't,

529
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,460
if they have the time to test,

530
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,870
because they were, as I mentioned,

531
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,990
they were focusing on other
modernization and other things.

532
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,590
So I think those ones were
one of the biggest challenges.

533
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,430
And then-
- So you had,

534
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,370
you got their buy-in early to do testing,

535
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,500
you didn't have to pull them
off their development projects,

536
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,000
but as you migrated
infrastructure, they had,

537
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,790
you had their buy-in,
I guess, to validate.

538
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,990
- Yeah, they needed to validate

539
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,310
and also the user, right?

540
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,950
And also then go to the business

541
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,260
and then, hey, we are
moving these workloads

542
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,360
that are really, really
big, really important.

543
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,760
They already, all the company
knows how is our strategy

544
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,130
for the main and the critical
applications that we have.

545
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,850
So taking this different
approach was a bit difficult

546
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,500
with them, just for, show them,

547
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,020
hey, we, we will move this workloads

548
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,850
in a different manner that you're used to.

549
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,500
So you need to test and
you need to help us.

550
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,720
And now it's a shorter timeframe.

551
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,600
So that was a challenge as well.

552
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,360
But also we will learn in the way that,

553
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,480
at the beginning, as I
discussed previously here

554
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,220
in our conversations,

555
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,630
EVS was only a transition point.

556
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,940
Well, we were thinking in only
moving our workloads to EVS

557
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,650
to then start moving to another plans,

558
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,680
another modernization plans
that we will discuss later.

559
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,150
But one of the things
that we find out there

560
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,340
is that all these benefits

561
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,130
and all this agility that even EVS gave us

562
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,960
as a transition point,
we started to think,

563
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,690
hey, what happens if we
keep some workloads here,

564
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,570
not all of them, because, of
course, we have other plans.

565
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,800
But those were one of the things

566
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,360
that we started learning there,

567
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,030
and at the end we started
reducing some costs

568
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,020
because we already moved some
of our workloads to the Cloud.

569
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,660
So we have on-prem services
with bigger servers

570
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,680
with a big environment that
we didn't need anymore.

571
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,380
So also when we moved
everything to the EVS,

572
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,180
we reduced some costs.

573
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,720
- What was the learning
curve, if there was one,

574
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,280
for the EVS move?

575
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,880
You had VMware knowledgeable
administrators and staff?

576
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,500
- Yeah, I think the key point here is that

577
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,930
I think the knowledge that
our partner and my team has,

578
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,460
it was like kind of the same.

579
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,170
Of course, we needed to learn a bit,

580
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,000
but as I mentioned, the
challenge was the time.

581
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,060
So they keep up, they start
scaling up this Countdown

582
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,010
or this service with EVS help us a lot

583
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,770
because we have the main person to help us

584
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,990
with this solution and
with this challenges.

585
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,260
So the learning curve
was really, really short.

586
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,500
- Was there any resistance

587
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,780
to just the whole concept
of moving to the Cloud?

588
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,750
I mean, a lot of people
like to run their workloads

589
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,362
in the place that they
built them maybe, you know?

590
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:50,670
- Well, I mean, at the
beginning, of course,

591
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,280
we have some barriers, some pushback.

592
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,870
But at the end we needed to move them.

593
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,703
- Needed to move.
- So, yeah.

594
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,390
- You had some real deadlines.

595
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,090
You had a bigger objective
to close data centers?

596
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,110
- Correct, correct.

597
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,360
The bigger objective was
close the data center

598
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,163
and not doing a tech refresh.

599
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,900
- Gotcha.

600
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,760
Thank you, that was really helpful.

601
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,343
Molly, oh, oh, I'm not ready to move on.

602
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,910
- So for lessons learned for us, you know,

603
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,080
when we first started,

604
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,510
prior to me coming to
office of the president,

605
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,653
the systemwide office,

606
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,670
they had given AWS to a
lot of people in my group.

607
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,890
They're like, hey, we'll
give you some training.

608
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,380
Here's some access, fly, be free.

609
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,660
You know, just mess around.

610
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,020
I would not suggest that as a strategy.

611
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,220
When I came into the organization,

612
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,870
people were really excited about AWS,

613
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,070
that part was really cool

614
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,140
that people were really
interested in the Cloud.

615
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,650
But what we had is people messing around,

616
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,840
doing things that cost us a lot of money,

617
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,330
doing things that weren't
set up in a secure way,

618
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,550
doing things that weren't
adding a lot of value.

619
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,580
And so, you know, then I had
to sort of claw it all back.

620
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,100
So that part was not ideal.

621
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,240
We did get interest,

622
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,680
but you can't just have people
throwing an app up into AWS

623
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,800
but keeping the database,
you know, in the data center.

624
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,060
So lots of things like that

625
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,210
where people just didn't know
because they were learning.

626
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,790
What we brought in, I
brought in a Cloud leader

627
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,190
who had a lot of experience doing Cloud

628
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,710
at two different other organizations

629
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,110
who set standards, had governance,

630
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,187
put in the FinOps things,

631
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:24,630
and we went from $50,000 a
month to $10,000 a month in cost

632
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,330
and, you know, massively
increased security.

633
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,840
But I was very unpopular when
I sort of clawed it all back.

634
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,810
So that was one of my lessons learned is

635
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,330
from the very beginning,
you need to have governance,

636
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,210
you need to have standards, and
you need to have leadership,

637
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,500
not just, you know, our partners,

638
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,420
but you need to have leadership in IT

639
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,450
that knows what we're gonna
do and how we're gonna do it.

640
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,540
Another big lesson learned
for me is our big project

641
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,820
that we were moving
that HR payroll system,

642
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,510
that our very first project
to AWS we had it all planned.

643
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,350
We had a budget and then COVID
hit and our budget got cut.

644
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,510
And, you know, it was
really disappointing.

645
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,420
But, you know, the team, just,

646
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,250
my team didn't wanna
tell the vendor anything.

647
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,080
Like, we don't talk to
the vendor, you know,

648
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,030
they're just gonna sell us stuff.

649
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,400
But treating the vendor
like a business partner

650
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,900
and saying, hey, this
is what happened to us,

651
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,730
we really wanna do this,
but our budget got cut

652
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,380
and we don't see a way to do it.

653
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,240
And just saying like, you know,

654
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,670
this is the reality of the situation.

655
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,090
And then we were able to get
AWS to figure some things out

656
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,350
with some of the programs that they had

657
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,000
that we weren't even aware of.

658
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,310
And that was what enabled
us to move forward.

659
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,320
So whether it's AWS

660
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,500
or any other vendor that you're
going to work with closely,

661
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,420
treating them like a business partner

662
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,330
and just telling them what's
going on, this is our problem.

663
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,270
And maybe they can't help you,
but at least you have trust.

664
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,530
Or maybe they can help you

665
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,510
in ways that you may not have fathomed

666
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,710
because they're going to have access

667
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,830
to these different programs
that you might have.

668
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,950
So I think it's,

669
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,290
that's a big thing is,
when there's problems,

670
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,490
when you think you have to cancel,

671
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,630
when there's problems with leadership,

672
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,510
whatever it is, just, you know, be honest

673
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,530
and be straight up.

674
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,150
I mean, they're already
your business partners.

675
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,150
You may as well let them in on
it to help solve the problem.

676
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,140
- Yeah, can I pile on?
- Yeah, please, yeah.

677
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,240
- Something similar, right?

678
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,510
When starting out,

679
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,960
we had a couple of folks
that were doing FinOps

680
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,310
and they were kind of isolated.

681
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,140
They were in their own
little groups and we,

682
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,850
they were pulled together recently,

683
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,950
I think just ahead of
when I actually got there.

684
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,080
And we had actually
started that discipline

685
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,070
within the organization.

686
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,680
And I wouldn't do this without it, right?

687
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,390
So if there's one thing
you're gonna set up first,

688
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,160
it would be a FinOps.

689
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,290
Get an idea of what's going
on in the environment,

690
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,430
have the ability to find it.

691
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,510
We've identified it a ton,

692
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,110
we've identified a ton
of wasted infra on-prem,

693
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,440
and we identified a ton in our
Cloud environments as well.

694
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,120
But we stay on top of it.

695
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,920
So we get the alert, we've,

696
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,780
they've got partnership
out into the business

697
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,760
and it works really well
when you show 'em the dollars

698
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,230
and you go in and it's
like, hey, what happened?

699
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,432
And it's not a month later,
it's not two months later,

700
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:53,820
it's a day.

701
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,320
It's within that first week, typically,

702
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,670
that we identify that.

703
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,990
And again, like you mentioned,

704
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,430
take advantage of the programs,

705
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,470
whether it be MAP or other, right?

706
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,940
For the Migration Assistance Program.

707
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,620
Those things work with

708
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,150
and partner with either your partner

709
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,323
and/or AWS to take
advantage of those programs.

710
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,470
- Anything else you wanna add?

711
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,260
- I totally agree on take
advantage of the MAP program,

712
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,730
as well, we used that.

713
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,630
And the FinOps, yeah.

714
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,460
At the beginning we have some questions

715
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,880
on how this different
approach with EVS will work,

716
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,090
but, of course, having
this, all these procedures,

717
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,891
all the team, all the force,

718
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:32,010
all the knowledge from
AWS to control the budget

719
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,930
to control this FinOps approach.

720
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,617
It's really important for
taking this kind of strategies.

721
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:39,150
- And it sounds like, I think I heard,

722
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,310
common across all three companies,

723
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,920
getting that centralized buy-in

724
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,713
and sort of a center of
excellence established,

725
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,710
really important setting a precedent

726
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,210
for how this can be successful.

727
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,580
Molly, I remember you saying, you know,

728
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,960
getting focused on a particular

729
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,063
application, you know, it's like-

730
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,340
- Well we had burning platform
after burning platform,

731
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,302
so it was easy.

732
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:02,730
(panelists laugh)

733
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,970
- That makes it, makes it
easy to pick, I suppose.

734
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,370
Great, well, very interesting.

735
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,710
So let's transition now.

736
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,130
Now that you are all
running workloads in AWS,

737
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,930
I'm curious on your thoughts
about what the future,

738
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,420
what's on your roadmap, you
know, modernization plans

739
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,430
or if you've already modernized what's,

740
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,590
just, what's coming for you?

741
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,000
Angel, why don't we
start with you this time?

742
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,390
- Sure, well, right now
we are around, like,

743
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,480
we will end up 2025, around 25-90%

744
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,780
of our applications on Cloud
with different strategies.

745
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,330
Of course, we need to keep moving ahead

746
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,920
and start maturing our applications,

747
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,170
mainly our tier three and
tier one applications.

748
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,890
So, talking about the
applications that we have in EVS,

749
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,384
we have a couple of options there.

750
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,460
Our tier three and our tier one,

751
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,470
they will go through a refactoring process

752
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,810
or a re-platform process for sure.

753
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,930
But now we are starting
to look into what tier two

754
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,561
and tier three apps need to be modernized,

755
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,400
which one of them will be retired

756
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
because maybe some of the features

757
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,890
will go to another application

758
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,170
that we already have been modernized

759
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,270
or which one of them will stay there.

760
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,640
And then, if we are keeping
some of those applications

761
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
in EVS is, how do we
improve the reliability?

762
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,610
Or if we have, if we start to,

763
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,660
we need to start thinking

764
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,043
in maybe having another
region from AWS for DRP,

765
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:22,230
as DRP for our back plan for EVS.

766
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,940
So that's, I think
that's one of the things

767
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,810
that we're looking into,

768
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,720
that our modernizations will keep going.

769
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,220
We have all of our strategies

770
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,953
that will leverage all the modernization

771
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:33,330
that we already have.

772
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,250
So it's important to keep
moving along the modernization.

773
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,320
- And your teams are continuing

774
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,510
to do modernization
activities, developers.

775
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,040
- They will still continue,

776
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,931
they will still continue
mainly for one of our towers

777
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:48,900
that they have some
applications left, to 2026.

778
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,790
Our plan is actually to end up

779
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,730
with all our applications
on Cloud for 2026

780
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,730
and decommission all the
three big main data centers

781
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,710
that we have for 2026 as well.

782
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,543
- Great.

783
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,200
Molly, you want to go next?

784
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,130
- Yeah, so we had started this
process, you know, years ago,

785
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,620
and then we really kind of finished up.

786
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,940
So we recently put
everything we had into AWS

787
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,980
and we got done a little bit faster

788
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,880
than we had originally planned

789
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,310
because of the VMware
sort of financial crisis

790
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,080
that was coming our way.

791
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,510
So there are some things

792
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,430
that we can continue to do to modernize

793
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,860
because we wanted to do
things a certain way,

794
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,480
but, because of the VMware thing,

795
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,950
we had to move really, really fast.

796
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,783
So we're going back

797
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,130
and doing some of the
modernization efforts

798
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,930
and some of those things moved over.

799
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,860
The other piece is,

800
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,440
and this is sort of not my usual strategy,

801
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,580
but some of the partners

802
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,500
that we signed up with at the beginning,

803
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,140
we had a partner that took
over our HR and payroll system

804
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,780
because at the time we didn't
have a lot of Cloud people.

805
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,220
We didn't really know what we're doing.

806
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,330
We're like, they're gonna be
better at managing than us.

807
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,643
Over time we've grown,

808
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,243
we've grown to be,
honestly, better at doing it

809
00:31:57,243 --> 00:31:58,500
than they are.

810
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,100
And so, you know, they
make a lot of mistakes,

811
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,780
they charge us a lot of money

812
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,820
and we actually put
together a plan recently

813
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,830
that says we're gonna keep, it's on AWS,

814
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,430
we're gonna keep it on AWS,
but we're gonna take it back.

815
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,140
I don't normally wanna do that.

816
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,640
Usually you get people who are out there

817
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,230
and they really are good at this stuff.

818
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,710
But our HR payroll system,
I'm just gonna say it,

819
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,000
it's a little customized.

820
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,830
It's not cookie cutter, it's not easy.

821
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,760
It's PeopleSoft, its old, you
know what I'm talking about,

822
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,080
Some of you, okay?

823
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,310
And it's very custom.

824
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,350
So this vendor isn't great at doing it,

825
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,090
but we are because we live it.

826
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,260
So we're gonna pull that back in

827
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,060
and we're gonna hire 10 people

828
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,630
to do the, basically do
the care and feeding of it.

829
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,120
But I think our team's
gonna be better at it.

830
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,790
That's what I've found
'cause we've, over time,

831
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,080
we've been able to hire people

832
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,190
that are all Cloud people.

833
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,590
We don't have to be in two worlds.

834
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,000
- Gotcha.

835
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,013
Tyler, why don't you share some things?

836
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,390
- We had a blend of things to do, right,

837
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,340
with the, those kind of
disparate data centers.

838
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,330
So we had some applications
that we were able to, kind of,

839
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,440
modernize as we went.

840
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,660
We had some that made sense
based on data gravity,

841
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,290
like I mentioned before
that ended up in Azure.

842
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,150
But we focused in on that.

843
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,070
We ended up, like I mentioned, doing AVS

844
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,960
and that was just again, to get us out.

845
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,130
- Right.
- Shut down data centers.

846
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,653
We plan on being out of all data centers.

847
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,810
There's one that really doesn't count

848
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,890
that'll be there for longer term,

849
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,000
but somebody else manages it
outside of the company, but-

850
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,030
So we plan on being out late 26,

851
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:34,170
maybe a little bit into 27,
where we'll be full Cloud

852
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,270
in a hybrid because we do
have some other SaaS stuff

853
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,490
that runs actually out in Oracle.

854
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,120
But from a modernization
perspective, that's our goal now is

855
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,040
as we move those things into AVS,

856
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,050
now we're gonna modernize out of there

857
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,810
and into AWS if, again,
if there's some workload

858
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,550
that makes sense, we can
put it wherever we want.

859
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,770
But the majority of
that's gonna go that way.

860
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,390
We plan on leveraging the migration lab.

861
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,420
So we're in talks with
them right now on finding

862
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,640
and identifying the right workload.

863
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,789
We had stuff-

864
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:04,650
- That the modernization lab?

865
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,810
- Yes, the AWS modernization lab.

866
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,850
So we're working with them
to identify the right target

867
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,650
for that, to leverage some
of those things that can

868
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,230
kind of use some of the
new tooling, et cetera

869
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,930
to kind of modernize,
give us, upgrade the code,

870
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,530
document stuff that we, you
know, some poor guy that came in

871
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,170
and the developer that is long
gone, so he's a, you know,

872
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,370
he has inherited that environment.

873
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,340
So what do you do to put
some of that stuff in place?

874
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,550
We had issues with HA and DR capability.

875
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,980
So that alone was enhanced

876
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,110
as we migrated our workloads
where it made sense.

877
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,010
So we still have some things that are,

878
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,790
don't have as stringent of SLAs

879
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,810
and things like that around it.

880
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,667
So we've kind of tried to manage that,

881
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,440
but we also have a lot of applications

882
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,900
that are moving to either an off the shelf

883
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,380
or SaaS platform that will
just need to ride out, right?

884
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,580
So we have some to keep the lights on.

885
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,010
So we may choose not to modernize those

886
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,180
and just ride 'em out

887
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,070
and then make sure that we
can decom 'em in the end.

888
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,290
So we've got every flavor of, kind of,

889
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,930
thing going on in the environment
that we have to manage.

890
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,780
- As you have ongoing
education for your teams,

891
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,630
things like the AWS, Well
Architected Framework,

892
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,740
and all that.

893
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,510
- Yeah, we leverage, again,

894
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,910
I don't think I'd said
Skill Builder yet here,

895
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,220
but when we were talking earlier,

896
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,800
I actually referenced
it to my cab ride over.

897
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,327
He was saying he was learning AWS

898
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,010
and so I pushed him towards Skill Builder

899
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,500
as an example of where
to go find, you know,

900
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,340
those types of things

901
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,570
and classes and things that you can take.

902
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,550
So we leveraged that heavily

903
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,410
and we've also blended the teams together.

904
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,110
So we actually, the folks
that were in the on-prem,

905
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,100
obviously they helped

906
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,260
and did a lot of that migration into AVS,

907
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,290
which would be similar
with the EVS solution.

908
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,360
And we were partnering
them up on the migrations

909
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,680
and really trying to cross train

910
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,750
and just get them together as a group

911
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,877
versus this whole,
we're two separate teams

912
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:45,720
and things like that.

913
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,950
And Skill Builder has been huge

914
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,930
on that upskill of our folks.

915
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,980
- Great, great.

916
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,020
Is that something you make
you of as well, Angel?

917
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,140
- Yeah, and I want to add here that,

918
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,050
not only focusing on EVS,
but all other applications

919
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,490
that we are doing these modernizations,

920
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,610
we are working today with,
our architecture team

921
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,090
is trying to make a framework
about how do we need

922
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,180
to mature every application
that we have to make

923
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,340
to really leverage and
have all the advantages

924
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,760
that the refactor and maturity can give us

925
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,050
to our applications.

926
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,250
So this is something that,

927
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,740
is this how, a work in progress

928
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,300
and it's part of the modernization plan

929
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,040
that we have already.

930
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,510
- Molly, anything to add?

931
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,340
- Yeah, I think that because
we've been doing this

932
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,570
over a long period of time,
you know, as people leave,

933
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,040
we've really been saying, okay,

934
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,030
we're going towards Cloud,

935
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,710
so we're going to hire more Cloud people.

936
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,360
So it's not like we started with a team

937
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,920
of a lot of Cloud experts.

938
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,690
We, you know, had a couple.

939
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,860
But over time, as you know,

940
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,870
you're going there every
time someone leaves,

941
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,810
we bring in somebody who's
really focused on that area.

942
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,520
And we also take advantage a lot

943
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
of the training that's offered.

944
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,280
'Cause there are people who are interested

945
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,560
in going that direction and can learn.

946
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,400
But we also, I have a
pretty aging organization.

947
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,840
The average age of,

948
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,030
you guys are gonna be
surprised when you hear this,

949
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,973
but the average age of IT
at my organization is 51.

950
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,483
Because a lot of people,
when they go to the UC,

951
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,130
they go there to retire,
to get a pension, right?

952
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,050
So we have a lot of older folks.

953
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,883
So of those-

954
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:12,090
- And you have their records still?

955
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,169
- Yeah.
- For 99 years,

956
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:14,002
- For 99 years.

957
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:15,720
- 99 years, we gotta keep it.

958
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,240
So because of that, I mean
some of those folks, you know,

959
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,890
they're interested in learning,
but some of 'em are like,

960
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,480
Hey, I'm only gonna,
I'm only gonna be here

961
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,590
for like three more years.

962
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,690
You know, they kind of ride it out.

963
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,180
So we have different people there,

964
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,560
but we've been largely successful
at building that team out.

965
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,090
- Great, great, great.

966
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,720
Any other modernization thoughts
while we're on the topic?

967
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,130
- I mean anything you can do

968
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:42,210
to go with that automation
first kind of mindset,

969
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,180
kind of get folks out of
even the manual build,

970
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,254
manual builds, right?

971
00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:47,087
- Infrastructure as code.

972
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,140
- Yeah, infrastructure as
code, the Terraform stuff.

973
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,010
The things that we did

974
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,083
to kind of push that a little bit too is,

975
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,540
I think, it's every, every week

976
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,890
when we're on this get together,

977
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,780
I have an employee of mine
that's constantly saying,

978
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,940
hey, just give me more, gimme more, right?

979
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,410
So I'm like, like fill his queue.

980
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,630
Like keep him busy because
there's so many things out there

981
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,700
that we can do from an
automation perspective

982
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,200
that we just weren't taking advantage of.

983
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,460
So I think we're getting into that

984
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,620
and building that out as we go as well.

985
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,810
- And did you leverage any
of the Terraform things?

986
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,250
- Yeah, we, actually, we're
following also strategies

987
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,740
with Amazon Queue, for
example, for our developers.

988
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,903
They are using, they
are using it a bit more.

989
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:26,550
And the idea here is for
them to be more agile,

990
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,900
to keep modernizing to-

991
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,510
And now the new request from the business

992
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,517
will come out really, really
fast with all this effort

993
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:34,860
and all this modernization that we have.

994
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,050
- Yeah, and for EVS specifically,

995
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,600
did you script the build
of your environment?

996
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,760
You did, I know you
stretched your networks

997
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,630
and you did migrations.

998
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,300
How did you actually do the migrations?

999
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,890
Did you just, you did live migrations

1000
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,330
or you did 'em at night?

1001
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,130
- We did it at night actually, yeah.

1002
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:52,710
At the beginning of course it was a lot

1003
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,820
of planning before that.

1004
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,653
- Yeah.
- But yeah,

1005
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:56,850
of course all of our
migrations were at night.

1006
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,980
We need really small timeframes.

1007
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,690
One, one hour and a half

1008
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,980
because of our operations.

1009
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,420
But yeah, we did at night.

1010
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,120
- Thinking ahead to maybe
future modernization

1011
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,500
of those workloads, things
like AWS transfer for VMware,

1012
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,650
that's something that could
potentially play into discovery

1013
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,660
of that environment if you,
if you're trade choose.

1014
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,198
- Yeah, we're trying to look into a way

1015
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:18,318
to transform, actually.

1016
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:21,780
To start moving those
applications to the Cloud.

1017
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,550
- But as you said, they're
fine where they are.

1018
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,383
If you-

1019
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:25,216
- You know, I'll just mention something

1020
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:26,370
'cause you said Amazon queue.

1021
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,210
We did find something that was
helpful with that recently.

1022
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,200
We have, unfortunately,

1023
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,060
'cause we are an education organization,

1024
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,470
we have some custom stuff.

1025
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,090
Okay, we have a lot of custom stuff.

1026
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,530
I wish we had zero custom stuff,

1027
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,460
but we do, so there's a tool in queue

1028
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,550
that allows you to go from
Java 17 to 21 with help

1029
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,530
with their, with basically the AI help.

1030
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,040
And so we did use, utilize
that for all of our 17

1031
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,140
to maybe to 25, 21.

1032
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,890
It was actually really helpful.

1033
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,840
The team was really suspect of it.

1034
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,134
They said, we'll try it
with one and we'll see.

1035
00:39:57,134 --> 00:39:59,400
But they were pretty happy with it.

1036
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,450
- Wonderful.

1037
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,970
- Yeah, I think, with stuff
like that, as it matures

1038
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,250
and you can take advantage
of it, I mean we're even,

1039
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,410
I mentioned a bunch of
kind of keep the lights on

1040
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,630
and these apps that we might write out.

1041
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,240
It still may be a value if
it's that one developer,

1042
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,110
we don't know that much.

1043
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,190
And so we're afraid to touch it

1044
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,080
or we're afraid to patch it
that we may still go ahead

1045
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,420
and throw it at these tools
just to see what we get.

1046
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,890
So it's like getting people to change

1047
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,770
that mindset a little bit
of like, why not, right?

1048
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,030
Let's go ahead and throw this at it,

1049
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,290
see what it produces.

1050
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,820
And if it's easier to understand

1051
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,440
and maintain, even though
we're just gonna, kind of,

1052
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,930
ride it out for the next
year and a half or two,

1053
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,140
it still makes sense to run
through those types of tools.

1054
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,973
- Yeah.

1055
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,420
Any other thoughts on modernization?

1056
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,240
All right, well if you,
thank you very much.

1057
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,890
That was a great, great discussion.

1058
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,110
I think it was really
beneficial for everybody.

1059
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,140
If you are interested in
learning how you can get started,

1060
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,850
we recommend these basic steps.

1061
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,680
First, assess your VMware estate.

1062
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,350
We think the best way to
do this is with an OLA,

1063
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,960
an Optimization and Licensing Assessment.

1064
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,840
Customers tell us this is
extremely valuable to them,

1065
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,270
even before they implement
the recommendations

1066
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,380
of the assessment.

1067
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,885
A lot of the information
provided is beneficial

1068
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:09,060
and can actually save you money.

1069
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,880
Second is leverage the
AWS partner network.

1070
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,470
We have over 460 migration
competency partners

1071
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,060
who can help you with your migration.

1072
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,070
So don't hesitate to work with them.

1073
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,434
As you've seen several
of our customers here

1074
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,900
have done that with various partners.

1075
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,030
Next, decide on your
approach and strategy.

1076
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,700
I mean, do you wanna start
with a single application?

1077
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,720
Maybe help improve performance
or increase resiliency?

1078
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,790
Or perhaps you're facing
a hardware refresh

1079
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,680
or a data center lease expiration

1080
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,300
and you've got a compelling event,

1081
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,850
you've got to make a decision
and move the whole thing

1082
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,530
and plan a full data center migration.

1083
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,690
But once you've decided on your approach,

1084
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,690
we can help you with
training, support, services,

1085
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,260
purpose-built technologies.

1086
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,260
We've got ISV tools that can
help with migration services

1087
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,980
and also the incentive programs,

1088
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,473
MAP, as was mentioned several times.

1089
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:03,630
We have these services,
we really wanna help you.

1090
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,990
So please partner with
your AWS account team.

1091
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,460
If you have a technical account manager,

1092
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,390
if you have an account SA,
don't hesitate to ask them

1093
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,640
what they can, you know,
bring to the table for you

1094
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,310
in terms of funding or like I said,

1095
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,570
third party tools, et cetera.

1096
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,403
Excuse me.

1097
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,340
I also wanna leave you with these QR codes

1098
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,730
for a few resources that
you can leverage this week,

1099
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,810
including the AWS for
VMware, re:Invent the guide.

1100
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,070
This will help you quickly locate

1101
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,700
interesting VMware sessions
at the conference this week.

1102
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,250
We've got a nice blog post together

1103
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,960
with all of those put together.

1104
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,120
Next, there's a link on getting started

1105
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,680
with a migration assessment.

1106
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,240
This will help you reduce costs

1107
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,400
and build your business case.

1108
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,120
And then finally, a link to
the AWS for VMware website

1109
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,100
where you can keep up
with our latest offerings

1110
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,093
and announcements.

1111
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,510
And then this eye chart here, sorry,

1112
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,430
please feel free to take
a photograph of this,

1113
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,820
but this is a slide
showcasing all the additional

1114
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,180
AWS for VMware sessions
happening this week at re:Invent.

1115
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,540
A couple to call out, there's
an AWS Transform Workshop

1116
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,700

00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,030
as well as two AWS
transform breakout sessions

1118
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,070
