1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,090
- Excellent. Hey
everybody, how's it going?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,923
- [Audience] Good.

3
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:05,892
- First day of re:Invent
going well so far?

4
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:06,725
(audience cheering)

5
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:07,800
- Woo! Thank you.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,850
Thank you for attending.

7
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,890
I know there's a lot of
things on your schedule

8
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,600
that are probably conflicting with this.

9
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,290
You are our people, so thank
you for prioritizing operations

10
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,690
and incident management
over all of those activities

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,430
that are happening in the
expo center right now.

12
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,600
So, this is the more valuable one by far.

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,080
So, just to get things started,
this is not going to be

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,340
a slide-heavy presentation.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,880
Nora and I are just going
to be spending a lot of time

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,510
talking about different concepts

17
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,810
associated with AI and operations.

18
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,670
So, we're gonna try and keep
this a little bit more casual.

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,000
So, to set the stage, what we'd like to do

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,170
is actually get a selfie
with everybody in the room.

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,750
So, if everybody could
just lean in a little bit,

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,940
I'm gonna use my extendable arm here

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,720
and grab a picture of
everybody real quick.

24
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,550
All right, smile. Thanks, everybody.

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,110
Excellent. All right.

26
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,190
- Awesome.
- Let's dive in.

27
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,990
- Thanks y'all. All right, so,
thank you again for coming.

28
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,450
Like Tom said, we know this is
the last session of the day,

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,540
the first day of re:Invent, and
we are going to keep it fun.

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,327
We've known each other for
several years now, I think.

31
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:15,390
- Five.

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,040
- And we've bonded over the topics

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,130
that we're talking about today.

34
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,300
And we thought the best way to do this

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,270
is to kind of have, you
know, a great conversation

36
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,253
about these topics like we like to do.

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,370
So, I'm Nora Jones.

38
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,970
I am a VP of product
development here at PagerDuty

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,975
and I'm joined today by Tom Leaman,

40
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:38,250
who is VP of site reliability engineering

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,309
at one of our amazing customers

42
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,560
and who has been a fantastic
partner to us at PagerDuty

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,229
over the years, Warner Bros. Discovery.

44
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,730
- Thank you, Nora.

45
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,440
Like Nora mentioned, Tom Leaman,

46
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,750
VP of site reliability engineering.

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,430
Just to level set,

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,350
because I think everybody
has their own definition

49
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,030
of site reliability engineering.

50
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,490
What that translates into
at Warner Bros. Discovery

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,260
is that our SRE teams

52
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,330
handle all of the engineering solutions

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,780
for what we consider proactive
and reactive reliability,

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,831
database reliability, FinOps,

55
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:11,070
and site reliability operations,

56
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,670
which is our incident management
and analytics function.

57
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,560
And, we support HBO Max,
Discovery Plus, TNT, you name it,

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,200
any of our DTC, direct
to consumer products

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,129
that happens to be within the bounds

60
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,407
of site reliability engineering at WBD.

61
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:28,682
- Amazing.

62
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,440
And, today we're gonna
be having a conversation

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,450
around, you know, a favorite topic

64
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,410
that's happening right now,

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,920
which is AI-driven automation
for modern operations.

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,320
We've spoken a lot as an industry

67
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,620
and we've been using AI over
the past several years now,

68
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,780
and it's really escalated recently.

69
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,220
But we wanna talk today

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,730
about how we can leverage
it a little bit more

71
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,370
in operations and within
resiliency and reliability.

72
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,190
We talk about how it
impacts reliability a lot,

73
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,800
but how can we leverage
it to our advantage

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,386
when we are in some of
these emergency situations?

75
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:03,075
Or even when we're in the context

76
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:06,783
of more well-understood
situations as well?

77
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:11,783
And so, I know Tom has gone on
a lot of a journey with this,

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,640
even within Warner Bros. Discovery.

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,550
You've been there for four years now

80
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,520
and you've done a huge
technology shift internally, too,

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,440
which we'll get into in a little bit.

82
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,073
But even within PagerDuty, you know,

83
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:28,470
we've been working with
a lot of our customers

84
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,800
for a long time now, and
we're seeing how the folks

85
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,460
that are adopting AI and
automation are resolving

86
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,770
and responding to incidents better

87
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,920
and more confidently than, you know,

88
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,356
folks that are not
leaning into it as much.

89
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,323
So for example, in 2025
we saw that enterprises

90
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:51,290
that increased their use of
PagerDuty AI and automation

91
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,280
actually had a faster
incident resolution time

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,580
by about 2.8x, which ended up totaling

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,400
to over six hours in 2025.

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,370
And part of the reason I'm so
excited to talk with Tom today

95
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,940
is Warner Bros. has been
a great partner to us

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,773
over the years.

97
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:11,460
You know, we've changed as the company,

98
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,290
the industry's changes, you know,

99
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,420
and Warner Bros. has changed as well.

100
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,370
And we've been really working together

101
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,380
to help you stay resilient

102
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,960
and to help us build a
platform that matters.

103
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,320
So first of all, thank you for that.

104
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,570
I'm curious, you know,
if you could get into

105
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,040
some of the shifts that you
have been experiencing recently

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,280
at Warner Bros., even
starting with when you joined.

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,270
- Yeah, absolutely.

108
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,750
So, I'm going to take a
trip down memory lane,

109
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,637
go back to about 2022, 2023,

110
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:44,430
around when Discovery Communications

111
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,773
and Warner Media merged together.

112
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,110
There was a decision that was made

113
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,570
that we would end up launching

114
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,200
a net new streaming application
called Max, now HBO Max.

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,180
There was also an HBO Max back then.

116
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,650
You've been through the journey with us,

117
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,223
I won't talk about that any more.

118
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,400
(Nora chuckles)

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
As a part of that process,

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,610
we had about a nine month deadline

121
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,060
to create and build this net
new streaming application.

122
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,000
And the intention was that
we weren't just going to take

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,410
one of our preexisting products,

124
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,260
whether it was the Discovery
Plus streaming application

125
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,340
or HBO Max as it stood
then, and then rebrand it.

126
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,160
Instead, we thought this
was a great opportunity

127
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,680
to establish a stronger consistency

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,983
with our technical platform

129
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:31,983
and engage engineers,
operators, product TPMs

130
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,180
in standardized processes
across our organizations.

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,090
So effectively what we did
was we built this platform

132
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,828
as a best of both worlds,

133
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:43,476
taking lessons learned from both locations

134
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,454
and aligning on a
similar technology stack.

135
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:48,930
I'm not gonna go into the
details of the architecture,

136
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,940
that's not the topic of this conversation.

137
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,850
But, a core part of what we did back then

138
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,980
was understand and align

139
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,920
on how we would describe our system.

140
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,020
Probably one of the most
foundational concepts

141
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,030
that we came up with at that point in time

142
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,400
was the operational metadata schema.

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,075
And this was a standardized approach

144
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,450
by which we catalog our services

145
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,224
and systems throughout the entirety

146
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:13,620
of the software development life cycle

147
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,891
so that we could easily understand

148
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,435
from the point of a
repository being created,

149
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,700
we could understand the
hierarchy of business functions

150
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,890
represented within that repository,

151
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,570
through the CICD pipelines

152
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,530
to our deployed infrastructure,
services, metrics, logs,

153
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,070
and eventually incidents
handled in PagerDuty.

154
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,300
We would carry through that metadata

155
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,400
that would identify the business function

156
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,000
like consumer, commerce,
playback capabilities,

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,910
down to the microservice that
it ended up tying back to.

158
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,880
This gives us really great traceability

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
when it comes to handling an incident,

160
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,760
when handling operations,
handling things like FinOps

161
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,460
and metering across the board.

162
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,890
Beyond that, which was very much

163
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,580
almost a vertical Conway's Law set up,

164
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,850
many of our organizations were
set up in a similar fashion.

165
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,680
We had this concept that we created

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
called the Critical User Journey,

167
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,510
and these were horizontal
slices of functionality

168
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,550
that were most important to our customers,

169
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,330
things like playing back
video, the ability to log in,

170
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,370
being able to browse and search.

171
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,880
So, we were able to map
many of these components

172
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,420
and microservices to those
customer user journeys.

173
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,310
This helped us prioritize our work,

174
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,008
how we would classify incidents,

175
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:30,750
and effectively drove a lot of our work

176
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,553
within the operations space.

177
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,510
- What I'm also hearing a lot
of in there is just, you know,

178
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,760
you had these two applications

179
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,334
and then you were building
another application,

180
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,860
but you also had two cultures
that you were merging

181
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,087
and then you were
co-creating a third culture

182
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,720
while launching this application.

183
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,300
And I'm also, you know,
I've been through this,

184
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,829
we've all been through a lot of this,

185
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:55,650
unless you're explicitly
putting it out there,

186
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,030
there are different assumptions

187
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,460
around what reliability means,

188
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,380
what the most important business value is,

189
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,855
and you might have actually
been experiencing that

190
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,182
with even these two different cultures.

191
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:09,710
And so, what I like about this
operational metadata concept

192
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,113
is it's like helping create
that common vernacular.

193
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:16,458
Who did you have in the room

194
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,050
when you were having these conversations?

195
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,593
- Yeah, so it was folks
from across technology,

196
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:24,990
product business that were all involved,

197
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,431
especially as we were defining
those Critical User Journeys

198
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:30,150
because at the end of the
day, you need the buy-in

199
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,557
from folks that are outside
of the technology space

200
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:34,366
to be able to actually provide input

201
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:36,884
on what we think those
most important functions

202
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,900
are going to be, and then back
that up with data as well.

203
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,130
So, this was actually a
very welcome conversation

204
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,670
across the board, that by
proactively engaging these groups

205
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,880
outside of engineering in
the process of operations,

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,160
it helped us get to common ground

207
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,890
as far as how we talk about
incidents and operations

208
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,020
and priorities across the board.

209
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,619
- Amazing.

210
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:02,430
So, this actually is a great segue

211
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,380
into some of how we've been talking

212
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,930
about different archetypes
that we might experience.

213
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,281
And, you know, if we
take it at a high level,

214
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,685
we can think of operational situations

215
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,591
fitting into one of three
archetypes or maybe a mix of two.

216
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,640
We have new and novel situations,

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,770
which we've all experienced a lot of,

218
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,731
and these will only increase
as we add new technology

219
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,282
and add new complexity
and businesses grow,

220
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:30,282
which are brand-new situations,
which require a human being

221
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,419
to put their expert attention into it.

222
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,730
We've partially understood situations,

223
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,850
which you know, seem kind of familiar,

224
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,500
maybe we haven't seen it in a long time.

225
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,850
Maybe the people that dealt with it

226
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,520
are not at the organization anymore.

227
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,357
And then we also have
well-understood situations.

228
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:48,384
These are things that, you know,

229
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:53,384
get us pulled into, you
know, day in and day out.

230
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,680
But they shouldn't require a human being

231
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,412
to necessarily interrupt their workflow.

232
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:01,410
And so, what you were kind of dealing with

233
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,442
with this new app that you
were launching in nine months

234
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:07,950
was sort of this new and novel situation,

235
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,754
which requires a lot of
communication as well.

236
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:16,754
Can you talk about how that got developed?

237
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,640
- Yeah, so a lot of it
boils down to investment

238
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,570
in that foundation because the
more that you can document,

239
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,490
the more conversations that you can have,

240
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,710
the more of that foundation
that you can build up,

241
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,477
like with the operational metadata,

242
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:32,965
the CUJs coming to those
types of alignments,

243
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,080
the fewer situations you'll run into

244
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,300
that are the new and novel domain.

245
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
- Mm-hmm.
- And when you are in the new

246
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,710
and novel space, you can
leverage a combination

247
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,130
of things like automation,
artificial intelligence,

248
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,170
standardized ways by
which you're organizing

249
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,677
your information, to
be able to disambiguate

250
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:56,760
and find some insights
to be able to suss out

251
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,190
some of those new and
novel situations itself.

252
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,265
- Mm-hmm, and you've sort of codified

253
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:03,660
what is important to the business

254
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,150
and are helping folks
that are on the ground

255
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,800
resolving the incidents understand it,

256
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,410
but helping the business
sort of form that alignment

257
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,441
with them as well.

258
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:16,050
How do you see that model evolving with AI

259
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,430
and how do you see AI playing a part

260
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,890
in helping folks understand, you know,

261
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,540
the operational model?

262
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,520
- Oh, absolutely.

263
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,650
So I think there's a really,
really solid opportunity,

264
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,440
and we're even leveraging
it internally as well,

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,470
is pointing agents at those
types of knowledge bases,

266
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,140
whether it happened to be
the OMD service catalog

267
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,435
that we happen to have
that provides this listing

268
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,460
of all of the different
business functions,

269
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,460
capabilities and
microservices to run books

270
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,008
that are stored in standardized locations

271
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:48,454
referencing that OMD taxonomy.

272
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,087
LLM agents that are
pointed at that information

273
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:54,455
can then be used by a
wide range of personas

274
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:56,272
to gain a better understanding

275
00:11:56,272 --> 00:12:00,210
of what your system happens to be.

276
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,450
And, no more of an important time is there

277
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,680
than in the middle of an incident

278
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,006
to be able to get that type of context

279
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:09,120
because not every single
engineer in our organization

280
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,958
is going to be able to understand

281
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,520
the entire distributed system,

282
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,210
all of our business
functions across the board.

283
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,030
But what agents provide
is a quick and easy tool

284
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,490
to be able to provide that
access at their fingertips

285
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,320
versus trolling through
hundreds of wiki pages

286
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,740
- Right.
- Or dozens of dashboards.

287
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,887
- Which takes a lot of time

288
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,785
when you're trying to stop the bleeding

289
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,200
and get back to a customer's experience

290
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,399
as quickly as possible.

291
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,810
Has anyone in the room been
in the middle of an incident

292
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,480
or, you know, before an incident started

293
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,930
and everyone's kind of
debating what SEV level it is

294
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,390
or if it is even an incident?

295
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,040
Has that ever happened to folks?

296
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,340
Yeah, I feel like it's
a pretty common thing

297
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,210
and it keeps happening.

298
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,280
And so, what I like about
the approach you're taking

299
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,140
is it's evolving with the folks,

300
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,290
but it's also giving them
someone to gut check with

301
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,860
and that is kind of an
agent in those situations.

302
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,693
- Absolutely.

303
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:04,983
And we've started to see some
success with that already.

304
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:07,920
Recently, within the past
couple of weeks actually,

305
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,740
we just released into a internal beta

306
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,418
in our site reliability operations team,

307
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,750
a incident severity classification agent.

308
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,050
So by providing a lightweight description,

309
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,670
you can feed that into the agent

310
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,760
and it will actually reference
a lot of our documentation

311
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,890
associated with severity matrixes.

312
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,440
Now, pretty much everybody in the room

313
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,990
raised their hand earlier
about being in a debate

314
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,685
about incident severity.

315
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:37,713
I'm gonna ask for some participation here.

316
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,850
Why? Why do people debate severity?

317
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,110
Shouldn't it be clear cut?

318
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,870
You can just point to
a metric or a measure.

319
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,130
(attendee speaks indistinctly)

320
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,963
Absolutely.

321
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:51,060
So just to repeat back for
folks that are viewing remotely

322
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,580
or on the recording, one of the questions

323
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,840
or one of the contributing factors

324
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,790
can be lack of documentation

325
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,650
or lack of awareness of documentation,

326
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,280
or potentially even substantially
robust documentation

327
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,990
that nobody's going to
be able to actually parse

328
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,820
and understand in the middle
of an incident, right?

329
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,434
- [Nora] Or even know where
it is or what to look up

330
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:11,370
in some of those situations as well, yeah.

331
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,683
- Yeah, I know,

332
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:15,693
oh, we've got another
raised hand back there.

333
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,060
Yeah, so the response there

334
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,041
was we may have different capabilities

335
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,130
that are used by smaller
subsets of customers

336
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,410
versus an entire product application.

337
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,750
You know, certainly in
the context of HBO Max,

338
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,240
if playback is not working,

339
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,910
that is an absolutely critical issue.

340
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,400
If a smaller-used
functionality isn't working,

341
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,920
then that might be a lower severity issue.

342
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,310
Now, one thing that we have
to think about within WBD

343
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,170
is we support so many
different product lines

344
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,110
that something that would be a SEV One

345
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,860
for one of our product lines
may not be the same scale

346
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,780
as what we see on HBO Max, right?

347
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,740
It's not going to reach a,
"Hey, we can't play back a video

348
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,290
at 9:00pm Eastern on a Sunday night,"

349
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,430
for whether it be "Task" or,
you know, "Welcome to Derry"

350
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,620
or "House of the Dragon," right?

351
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,490
- Yeah.

352
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,900
And, I think that what
you had brought up earlier

353
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,330
was like a lot of this
is alignment, right?

354
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,520
And then when you're in
the middle of an incident

355
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,353
and you know that something is down,

356
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,020
time is precious, right?

357
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,069
And fumbling for docs

358
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,830
versus sometimes trusting your expertise

359
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,020
is a decision that's being weighed.

360
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,000
And I think a lot of what you're doing

361
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,570
and a lot of how we've seen you utilizing

362
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,430
and revolutionizing
some of your operations

363
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,820
is to make that discernment
easier for folks

364
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,030
no matter where they
sit in the organization.

365
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,070
Can you talk a little bit about that?

366
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,360
- Yeah, kind of going back
to the example that I gave

367
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,590
with the agent that we
just deployed recently,

368
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,940
one huge investment that we've put in

369
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,080
over the past couple of months

370
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,470
is those types of collaborations
with folks across the board

371
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,468
where we've had conversations
with key business leaders

372
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:02,254
and key engineering leaders
across each of our CUJs

373
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:06,420
to really suss out exactly
what incident classifications

374
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,370
could be within their particular domain.

375
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,937
So for playback, if this
happens to be the impact

376
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:14,040
or this subset of users or this platform,

377
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,448
or there's a regulatory issue,

378
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:18,450
or there happens to be an issue

379
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,550
associated with our observability platform

380
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,930
or deployment pipelines.

381
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,415
And we were able to work through
and collaborate with folks

382
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:27,450
because everybody understood
what was in it for them.

383
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,200
Because it removes that level of debate,

384
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,330
it removes that level of
lack of trust in the process

385
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,220
because you can actually
see it coming together.

386
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,524
Now, after we put all of that together,

387
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,660
we ended up with spreadsheets

388
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,490
that were hundreds of rows long

389
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,820
and the immediate reaction
was going back to it,

390
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,960
the documentation's too long,

391
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,070
no one's gonna be able to parse it,

392
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,510
but that's where the agent comes in

393
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,143
because an agent can parse it,

394
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,080
it can actually derive that value

395
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,210
and it can get it to you right
in the middle of an incident

396
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,830
without much of a problem at all.

397
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,663
- Right.

398
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,320
And I'm sure that also, you know,

399
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,131
even if you have new people on the team,

400
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,787
that likely can ramp them up more quickly

401
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:08,717
so that you have more
expertise in the mix as well.

402
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,260
- Oh, absolutely.

403
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,970
And lemme take a backtrack real quick.

404
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,020
There was a quote that I heard
as far as leveling someone up

405
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,946
when it comes to an
understanding of architecture.

406
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:24,696
How many of you have been onboarded

407
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:28,410
or helped onboard a person
and sent them a list

408
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,700
of around 15 to 20 wiki pages
and architecture diagrams

409
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,089
to get up to speed?

410
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,630
I see smiles, I see nods.

411
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,580
- Same business.
- We have all been there.

412
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,247
- Yeah.
- I, yes.

413
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,600
And then they go on a retreat, hibernate,

414
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,095
and then after winter is over,

415
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,380
they get thrown at their first incident

416
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,023
and the first thing they do is?

417
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,927
Page a senior engineer.

418
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:55,684
'Cause they don't know how
the system actually operates.

419
00:17:55,684 --> 00:18:00,061
But, you throw someone
in that incident upfront,

420
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,950
they're gonna learn real fast.

421
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,210
- Right.

422
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,170
- Sure, they should have some help,

423
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,130
they should have some handholding.

424
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,500
You don't want somebody
that's responding to a SEV One

425
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,570
actually taking the reins
if they're, you know,

426
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,120
just straight out of college,
something along those lines.

427
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,490
But, you equip them in those positions,

428
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,470
whether it's through an
actual live incident,

429
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,110
whether you're recreating an
incident with fault injection

430
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,640
in a lower-level environment,
you equip them with an agent

431
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,130
that also has the
information at its fingertips

432
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,390
of past incidents, runbooks,
all of this information

433
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,610
and that individual can get up to speed

434
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,710
and understand the
context of what's going on

435
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,180
much, much faster.

436
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,520
It's effectively training
wheels for, you know,

437
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,890
when they're actually going
live and working independently

438
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,710
as on-call engineers and operators.

439
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,130
- And as an industry, you know,
for the last several years,

440
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,240
I think we've all been in companies

441
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,002
where we've experienced a major incident

442
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:55,380
and you know, as much
as you try to avoid it,

443
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,950
there're like three people you know

444
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,680
that you want in the
room helping you, right?

445
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,110
And I think what we're
seeing as an industry

446
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,440
and how we're evolving is
that we can kind of remove

447
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,940
knowledge silos a little bit.

448
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,620
We're disseminating knowledge

449
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,890
a little bit more readily

450
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,230
and leveling everybody up together

451
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,808
rather than leveling up people

452
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,800
in individual knowledge silos,

453
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,109
which can ultimately help our businesses.

454
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:26,460
I think one of the things that I,

455
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,640
so I was listening to your
podcast with Werner Vogels

456
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,680
around the frugal architect.

457
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,170
And one of the things
that you said on there

458
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,440
really stuck out to me because
I think it's so important

459
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,010
to keep in context, is that
we are doing reliability

460
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,720
not just for the sake of reliability,

461
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
not just for the sake
of keeping databases up,

462
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,810
but for the customer experience
and for customer trust.

463
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,667
And so, it sounds like
your operational model

464
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:57,060
actually helps disseminate
customer trust, all the way down

465
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,600
to what that means on a
service level as well.

466
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,390
And so I feel like that's
like very important

467
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,980
to keep in mind around, you know,

468
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,668
how you architect your processes, too.

469
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:10,433
And so you were mentioning
a little bit about SEV Ones

470
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:13,669
and SEV Twos and how they
follow certain processes.

471
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:17,400
Could you double click
into what the process is

472
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,630
for a SEV One?

473
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,237
- Yeah. So before diving into SEV Ones-

474
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,054
- Yeah?
- Why don't we talk

475
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,830
a little bit more about
just severities in general?

476
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,500
- Sure.
- The way that we operate,

477
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,407
we have four severity
classifications at Warner Bros.

478
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:35,085
SEV Ones and SEV Twos
are the most critical.

479
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:39,060
SEV Ones happen to be significant outages,

480
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,880
SEV Twos, we know a CUJ
happens to be impacted

481
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,840
in some way, shape or form for
a subset of our client base.

482
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,580
Threes and fours tend
to be very, very small

483
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,100
customer impact, if
not no customer impact.

484
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,420
So these could be situations

485
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,060
where you may have high memory utilization

486
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,640
or CPU utilization, you
should probably look into it,

487
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,250
but you know, the customer
experience is in a good space

488
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,810
in those situations.

489
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,030
So, based on that severity classification,

490
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,340
we'll actually handle those differently.

491
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,760
And so we track our time to acknowledge

492
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,670
and time to mitigate
measures very, very closely

493
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,350
for all of our incidents.

494
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,760
And for each severity type,

495
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,992
we have different SLAs associated

496
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,470
with each of those types of measures.

497
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,350
So time to acknowledge may
be a little bit more lenient

498
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,820
for SEV Threes and SEV Fours.

499
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,110
For SEV Twos and SEV Ones,

500
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,831
it's extremely short for time to mitigate.

501
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,330
Again, you know, those numbers come down

502
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,010
pretty substantially,
but also the expectations

503
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,465
associated with the process will evolve

504
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,010
based on that severity classification.

505
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,800
Threes and fours are largely landed

506
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,240
with the engineering teams.

507
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,130
And one thing we didn't
talk about yet is, you know,

508
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,750
our culture of incident operations at WBD,

509
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,540
we have very much the, you
build it, you run it function.

510
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,530
So while we do have groups

511
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,420
like the site reliability operations team,

512
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,373
which is there for every
incident to facilitate,

513
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:02,370
ensure that folks are following
the process appropriately,

514
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,770
we expect engineers that commit code

515
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,710
and develop the software to
actually respond to the pages

516
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,180
and be a core part of mitigation

517
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,324
of any type of incident
impacting their services.

518
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:15,434
So for SEV Threes and SEV Fours,

519
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,910
the SRO doesn't get involved.

520
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,430
Effectively that's an
engineering-only function.

521
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,320
Typically teams aren't paged for that,

522
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,720
although for SEV Threes, we
give them the opportunity to,

523
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,210
if they think that those
could potentially become

524
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,940
customer impacting down the road.

525
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,910
SEV Twos, these again are tied back

526
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,210
to some customer impact
associated with our CUJs

527
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,760
or some critical function
like legal, regulatory

528
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,160
or something that would
impact developer productivity

529
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,513
and back office functions.

530
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,800
Those will involve the site
reliability operations team.

531
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,070
They will facilitate the
process, page folks in,

532
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,920
we'll handle things like
stakeholder notifications,

533
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,930
note taking, the administration

534
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,420
of our PagerDuty incident
tickets to make sure

535
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,760
that things are in good order

536
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,830
as we're going through the incident itself

537
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,570
and when we close the incident out,

538
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,270
we've got the appropriate
metadata associated with it.

539
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,010
For SEV Ones, we add
on an additional layer

540
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,870
of expectation as a part of that process.

541
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,620
Not only are our time windows
much shorter on our SLAs,

542
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,290
but we actually kick in what
we call the technical call

543
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,700
leader rotation, which is
a dedicated response group

544
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,430
of VP and up leaders.

545
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,540
So these are individuals

546
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,670
that are involved in
providing executive level

547
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,910
communications across
the organization as well

548
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,860
as handling things like business decisions

549
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,120
and things along those lines.

550
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,490
So, as we go through
those severity levels,

551
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,160
we've ratchet up the
expectations, the responsibilities

552
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,760
and the folks that get involved.

553
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,460
- And it sounds like
you can leverage agents

554
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,160
or you are leveraging agents
to help with managing some

555
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,930
of those expectations depending

556
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,750
on the situation someone is in.

557
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,589
- Absolutely.

558
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:58,890
So, when we're looking at
a SEV Two for instance,

559
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,190
there is a very solid
opportunity to utilize agents

560
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,650
for things like those
status updates, right?

561
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,690
So in the middle of an incident,

562
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,490
things are complicated, right?

563
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,360
We're getting hit by changing
metrics, changing logs,

564
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,233
context from DMs that are coming

565
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,160
from the side channel conversations

566
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,010
and the chat that was spun up
specifically for the incident,

567
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,320
you may have a video conferencing bridge

568
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,820
that's set up as well.

569
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,320
There's a lot of information

570
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,250
and being able to discern that
into a well-structured update

571
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,310
that stakeholders across the
organization can understand

572
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,780
is no small feat.

573
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,700
So one area that we're looking at

574
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,670
and have lightly utilized
so far is using agents

575
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,940
to parse through certain
subsets of that data,

576
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,170
a combination of context from
conversations as well as some

577
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,440
of our operational data
to inform the details

578
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,970
of those status updates.

579
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,253
This significantly decreases
the toil from our operators

580
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:57,540
and reduces the amount of task switching

581
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,880
that's necessary in the
middle of an incident.

582
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,070
And this is certainly
beneficial when we're dealing

583
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,360
with a situation where we have

584
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,940
to do executive
communications, for instance.

585
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,190
So, being able to tie in automation

586
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,570
and agents to be able to
summarize the nitty gritty details

587
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,720
of a technology incident
such that it's understandable

588
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,850
across multiple business contexts

589
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,650
is an absolute game changer.

590
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,150
- Yeah, absolutely.

591
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,550
And you know, you mentioned like,

592
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,490
because executives aren't always
involved in every incident,

593
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,880
but SREs are, and so sometimes
when it goes into a new

594
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,237
process, it's like you haven't
practiced in a while, right?

595
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:36,810
And so it sounds like leveraging
agents to give you a leg up

596
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,230
to remember what executives
need in a situation, remember

597
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,830
what your customer service
folks need in a situation, like

598
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,720
you've brought up to me
before, you know, we have

599
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,910
our external customers, right?

600
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,590
And it's, you know, their experience

601
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,260
and their trust matters, but
we also sometimes in incidents

602
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,990
have internal customers as well that need

603
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,290
to know what's going on
to keep the lights on

604
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,490
and to keep things going.

605
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,323
- Yeah, absolutely.

606
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:01,920
And going back to the model

607
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,890
that you introduced before,
you know, no matter what type

608
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,650
of incident you're dealing with,
you're always going to have

609
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,120
that well-understood work.

610
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,670
What I was talking about before
with those status updates,

611
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,040
those are well understood pieces of work.

612
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,170
You know that your stakeholders are going

613
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,320
to expect messages every 15
minutes, every 30 minutes,

614
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,050
and there's a synthesis
process associated with that.

615
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,883
- Right.

616
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:25,380
- But beyond that well understood work

617
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,810
where agents typically are able, you know,

618
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,260
sometimes you can hand the
reins over to the agent as long

619
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,880
as you have a person saying yes,

620
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,220
that's an appropriate
message to send an executive

621
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,483
or to stakeholders.

622
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,770
There's also the concept of how agents

623
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,590
can better inform the incident response

624
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,470
of the responders, the
operators, the engineers

625
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,320
when they don't have
much context associated

626
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,240
with the incident or the functionality

627
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,590
that they're dealing with.

628
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,020
Again, I'm gonna lean into that.

629
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,410
WBD has a very complicated
ecosystem from a business as well

630
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,150
as a technology perspective.

631
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,910
So being able to keep track
of every single release,

632
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,970
every product function that
goes live is not something

633
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,600
that any engineer or any
leader is able to parse through

634
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
or keep in their memory's
short term cache.

635
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,190
But, an agent can, it can use retrieval,

636
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,590
augmented generation, it
can pull in information

637
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,910
from your wiki docs.

638
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,590
So, we've been in situations

639
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,360
where we've been managing incidents

640
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,200
and it is very, very
easy to turn to an agent

641
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,110
and ask questions about some
of what is being talked about.

642
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,820
In the case that you aren't familiar

643
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,500
with the discussion topic.

644
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,330
We had recently launched a capability

645
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,000
called, let's see, what was it?

646
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,650
Limited Free Experience.

647
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,900
And I wasn't super familiar
with that on the line.

648
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,280
And the acronym was being used

649
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,560
because who doesn't love a good acronym?

650
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,690
So it was LFE, and it was
some of the first times

651
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,240
that I had heard it, and
immediately I started seeing

652
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,310
the acronym that I
didn't understand, turned

653
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,720
to my handy dandy agent,

654
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,030
and immediately gave me back a report that

655
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,150
provided information on the
capability in that circumstance

656
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,640
to be able to actually
help better understand

657
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,670
ton hat helped me provide a better impact

658
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,960
the incident itself.

659
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,700
So, a lot of good opportunities,

660
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,310
whether we're talking
about not well understood

661
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,230
to very, very well understood.

662
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,940
- And, I think you
brought up a good point.

663
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,760
Like we could be in a
new and novel situation,

664
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,810
but part of the resolution of
that could be well understood,

665
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,080
maybe like how we need to
provide status updates to folks.

666
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,360
And so it's not necessarily, you know,

667
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,940
and if we're looking at
this whole life cycle

668
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,890
that we see on the screen,
it's not necessarily

669
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,920
that everything needs to
fall under one archetype.

670
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,510
It's that, you know, part

671
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,290
of these things could
be helped with agents.

672
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,420
I'm curious, you know, if
we're thinking about, you know,

673
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,180
on the left side of this
diagram, the build test

674
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,583
and deploy when we're
building a new capability,

675
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,630
I guess like when you're starting that out

676
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,550
and when you're scoping it and
when you're checking things

677
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,520
into code, you might
have an idea in your head

678
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,280
that something could be a SEV One later

679
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,110
or a critical service later.

680
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,290
How do you bring your
operational model schema directly

681
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,177
into the beginning of
that lifecycle as well?

682
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:10,140
- Yeah, so, well thankfully we
have some incredibly talented

683
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,450
engineers on our platform
engineering team such

684
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,590
that you can't get a repository
without actually defining

685
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,650
what some of the operational
metadata is associated with it,

686
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,910
especially the business function

687
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,370
and taxonomy associated with it.

688
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,153
That's normally something that engineers,

689
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:29,700
leaders are capable of doing
relatively independently,

690
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,710
as long as you aren't
creating naming conflicts

691
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,440
and we never have those
in engineering either.

692
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,030
But when it comes down
to functional impact,

693
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,300
so can this create a SEV One,
can this create a SEV Two?

694
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,910
How does it tie into the
rest of our ecosystem?

695
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,781
That might not be completely understood

696
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:50,970
when a repository is being created.

697
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,610
At WBD, we have a application

698
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,550
tiering mechanic whereby we tier

699
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,860
each and every microservice
that happens to come

700
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,579
through tier one to tier four.

701
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:02,606
Tier one, similar to SEV Ones,

702
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:05,580
happen to be the most business critical,

703
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,130
and there typically are
services that are tied directly

704
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,610
to those CUJs and tier
one services are capable

705
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,300
of creating those SEV Ones
across the organization.

706
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,680
Tier twos loose impact may
be in the path of A CUJ,

707
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,720
but not exactly critical path.

708
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,660
So they may go down, they
may do what we call fail open

709
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,960
so that it won't have customer
impact in those situations.

710
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,110
And then tier three, tier
four, typically back office

711
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,113
or non-customer facing functionalities.

712
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:40,350
What we do on a regular basis
is we will actually do a bit

713
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,020
of an auditing associated
with that tiering.

714
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,530
And a lot of it ties back to those CUJs.

715
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,380
We have load tests and fault
injection test automation

716
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,480
associated with those CUJs,

717
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
and we will execute those on
a regular basis to make sure

718
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,210
that we've got a clear
mapping of the components

719
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,360
and microservices that
tie back to each CUJ.

720
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,990
This gives us a good understanding
whereby we can check,

721
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,060
oh, hey, now we've got
a tier three service

722
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,790
that's now showing up as
a part of the call path

723
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,537
for our CUJ, we need to reclassify this-

724
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,710
- Right.
- As a part of that process

725
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,870
and then change its alerting structure

726
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,820
and mechanics for being able to create

727
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,670
and triage incidents when
they end up getting set

728
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,985
off and set off alerts.

729
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:25,380
- I'm sure many of us in the
room have had a surprise,

730
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,068
my service is critical situation

731
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,830
in the midst of an incident,

732
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,323
so I like that this is, you know,

733
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,120
being automated a little bit
more to provide that context

734
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,440
because as you said,

735
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,930
no human being can keep
all of this in their head.

736
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,940
And so it's a nice way to supplement it

737
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,593
so that we can run faster.

738
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,200
So let's say that, you know,

739
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,970
we are getting into an incident, right?

740
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,230
We've released a capability,

741
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,330
we've defined everything correctly,

742
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,010
and we're getting into an incident,

743
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,480
we realize it's an incident, right?

744
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,680
So if it works cleanly,
we have detect, triage,

745
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,140
diagnosing, repairing, and
learning from the incident,

746
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,300
but it's not linear, they all kinda,

747
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,740
you know, work together.

748
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,180
Maybe you think you've repaired it

749
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,470
and you're actually diagnosing

750
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,273
a new incident at the same time.

751
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,790
You all have leveraged a lot

752
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,650
of new PagerDuty capabilities

753
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,980
throughout this lifecycle recently.

754
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,250
Could you dive into what's
been most interesting to you?

755
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,083
- Yeah, absolutely.

756
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,520
I'll hit on a few different points

757
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,070
and try to tie it back
to some of the lifecycle

758
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,840
of the incident management process itself.

759
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,613
So, up at the very forefront,

760
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,420
I don't know if this is
necessarily a completely new

761
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,920
capability within PagerDuty,

762
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,350
but a big value add that we get is

763
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,770
with the PagerDuty noise
reduction capability.

764
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,950
This is something that all of
our services get by default,

765
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,020
and by and large, most of our developers

766
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,300
probably don't even know that it exists,

767
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,970
and that's how good it happens to be.

768
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,410
For every service that exists,

769
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,410
microservice, we have a
technical service in PagerDuty,

770
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,650
and each of those technical
services will automatically

771
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,550
merge alerts from that
microservice if they happen

772
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,470
to meet existing criteria.

773
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,710
So, if it happens to be
very similarly named alerts

774
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,680
that come in, same
summary, same description,

775
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,210
it'll automatically condense those

776
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,920
into a singular incident as no operator

777
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,660
or engineer wants to be
opening up their phone

778
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,700
to acknowledge 15 different incidents

779
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,880
that have all stemmed from
the exact same alert path

780
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,160
over the past three minutes or so.

781
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,480
So, that has been a huge boon.

782
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,633
We've seen about a 40 to 50% reduction

783
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:34,633
in incident creation due to
that noise reduction process.

784
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,993
So, big value add upfront.

785
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,520
Going into some of the
other capabilities, again,

786
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,560
just from the detection point of view,

787
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,140
we've leveraged the
operational, what is it?

788
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,820
The operational dashboard, the-

789
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,870
- Ops console.
- Ops console.

790
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,360
- Operations console.
- Operations console.

791
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,840
This provides a near
real time refreshing view

792
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,490
of filtered incidents.

793
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,860
It's something that we've
leveraged pretty heavily

794
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,290
associated with major launches.

795
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,450
These are situations where
you're probably going

796
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,240
to have, not just engineering,

797
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,160
but product business folks

798
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,260
that may be interested in
understanding the health

799
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,610
and wellbeing of the new
capabilities that are going live.

800
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,920
And the operations console
gives us the ability

801
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,600
to easily filter to pre-described
data sets associated

802
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,310
with incidents and then give those

803
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,810
to groups across the board

804
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,060
during these critical launch windows

805
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,000
so that you can find out
if we're launching HBO max

806
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,150
and a new country in EMEA,
we can find all the incidents

807
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,300
that pertain to that just based
on the title or description

808
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,370
or metadata associated with that incident.

809
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,920
So, we've seen a lot of value with that.

810
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,260
The third item that I'll
talk about is custom fields,

811
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,240
which I know is a fairly recent
capability within PagerDuty.

812
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,120
This has been something that
we've been clamoring for

813
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,250
for a bit because we
always want to be able

814
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,570
to add additional metadata

815
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,790
to our incident tickets themselves

816
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,730
because we find that
we're very, very analytics

817
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,620
and data driven at WBD.

818
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,800
So the more metadata that we
can attach to those incidents

819
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,940
and then gain insights into
over time, the more learnings

820
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,950
that we can gather and the more we can do

821
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,250
to make our systems more
reliable at the end of the day.

822
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,230
So we've utilized those custom fields

823
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,400
to track things like blast
radius, we automate the count

824
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,830
of customer support
tickets that are associated

825
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,960
with a particular incident

826
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,660
and we also leverage it
as a control mechanism

827
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,710
to kick off advanced
workflows that in the case

828
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,140
that somebody for instance,
wants to escalate an incident

829
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,000
to a SEV One, we make sure

830
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,490
that we've got enough data
within those custom fields

831
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,270
to actually assure that it is a SEV One.

832
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,460
Like I mentioned, we've got
a lot of extra processes

833
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,560
and practices associated with that.

834
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,090
So we don't wanna be in a position

835
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,250
where an individual developer

836
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,510
or somebody with the ability

837
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,630
to create a new incident
jumps it up to a SEV One

838
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,190
because they think it's a support request

839
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,360
and they want high priority

840
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,340
because that's going
to trigger an executive

841
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,080
or VP to get onto a line,

842
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,570
executive communications
go out, et cetera.

843
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,210
So we've leveraged a combination
of those advanced workflows

844
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,700
as well as the custom
fields to make that happen.

845
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,600
- Okay.

846
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,480
Yeah, and and what I like
about that too is, you know,

847
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
you were bringing up earlier

848
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,700
around in some incidents
there might be folks DMing

849
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,190
or calling people or
clamoring for information.

850
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,910
And so this puts some of that
right out in the open, right?

851
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,520
And so that they're all
operating under kind of a source

852
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,860
of truth as much as possible

853
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,510
and asking questions that align

854
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,840
with what's going on in the
middle of a situation as well.

855
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,673
- Without a doubt.

856
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:36,840
This has been a big part of some

857
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,690
of the cultural shift
that we have within WBD

858
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,500
is that the PagerDuty ticket,
the notes, the information

859
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,570
that happened to be in there is the source

860
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,010
of truth for our incident.

861
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,350
So if the information isn't
there, then it's not something

862
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,420
that's associated with the
timeline of the incident,

863
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,160
it's not the relevant information.

864
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,530
We'll certainly source
information from Slack,

865
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,950
but we're not going to point
a net new leader or developer

866
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,810
and say, "hey, go read through the reams

867
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,450
of Slack documentation
that happen to be there."

868
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,310
Instead, go to the PagerDuty ticket

869
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,450
and that's where you'll be able to get

870
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,640
the information that you need.

871
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,640
- And, we touched a little
bit on this in the beginning,

872
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,760
but you know, you've had to
do a lot of cultural changes

873
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,210
around this as well, and
like, as businesses grow

874
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,090
and as businesses come
together like that, you know,

875
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,070
we'll keep evolving.

876
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,597
I'm curious how, you know,

877
00:37:24,597 --> 00:37:27,360
you mentioned you involved
different stakeholders

878
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,590
in the room, but how
did you help engineering

879
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,040
and teams understand how their definition

880
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,200
of reliability was changing and evolving

881
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,540
and maybe how their processes might be

882
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,400
changing and evolving too?

883
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,580
- So, it's always a
difficult problem to solve,

884
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,160
to convince people to do
a thing that you want them

885
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,740
to do when they're very happy with

886
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,230
what they happen to be doing, right?

887
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,560
So the big thing there is the
what's in it for me, right?

888
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,680
The more that we can translate our message

889
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,440
and what we're looking to do into things

890
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,190
that will help those teams
out drive value, reduce,

891
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,300
reduce toil, those are the
ways that we get those wins.

892
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,660
So typically what we'll do is
we'll find business partners,

893
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,720
engineering partners, that'll
be those early adopters

894
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,523
that are incentivized or understand,

895
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,830
hey, I can see the value
in what you're trying

896
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,560
to accomplish here, to
start the snowball effect

897
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,390
to get folks on board.

898
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,510
So, when it came to a lot of
the changes for technology

899
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,630
and commonalities
associated with processes,

900
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,990
even though we had
engineers, process leaders,

901
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,230
business leaders that had
very different opinions

902
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,540
across the board, we were able to get some

903
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,563
of those folks up front that understood,

904
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:43,290
hey, at the end of the day,

905
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,720
if we all marched to the same drumbeat

906
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,020
and row in the same direction,
we're going to be able

907
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,773
to accomplish a lot more and
it's going to be better off,

908
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:52,800
not only for me as an individual,

909
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,170
but also the broader organization as well.

910
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,700
- Yeah, absolutely.

911
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,180
I like the, what's in
it for me, framing it.

912
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,463
What were patterns you were looking for

913
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:04,830
with those early partners that told you

914
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,710
that they would be more
incentivized to try this out

915
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,540
with you and sort of partner with you?

916
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,800
- Ideally, some excitement.

917
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,480
So sometimes there are just some folks

918
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,580
that are just general
early adopters, so they-

919
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,413
- Sure.

920
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:20,130
- I don't have favorites, for
anybody at WBD that happens

921
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,140
to watch this at another point in time.

922
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,930
But, certainly within an
organization you'll be able

923
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,790
to find some folks that typically want

924
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,250
to be at the forefront
of net new capabilities,

925
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,430
new functionality and
processes that can get on board

926
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,710
and provide honest feedback.

927
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,730
That's something that's critical.

928
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,580
You don't just want folks
that are there to be, yes,

929
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,410
I wanna be an early
adopter, I'm never going

930
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,670
to provide you any feedback

931
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,620
and whatever ends up going
through, this is great

932
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,850
because I can add it to my resume

933
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,590
or I can add it to, you know, my delivery

934
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,000
and performance review
at the end of the year.

935
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,860
That's not the point.

936
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,210
You want folks that are early adopters

937
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,970
that can also provide good
feedback on what you're trying

938
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,740
to accomplish so that your process

939
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,470
or your technology ends up
actually becoming better

940
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,760
through their involvement.

941
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,740
And thankfully at WBD, we've got a number

942
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,860
of different service teams
that we've been able to make

943
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,540
that work with on a regular basis.

944
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,890
- Amazing.

945
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,160
We've talked a lot about
this lifecycle in context

946
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,450
to, you know, a new and
novel incident and a SEV One,

947
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,810
but what about when it is a
little bit more well understood?

948
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,030
You know, you've mentioned reducing toil

949
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,060
and how you're leveraging
some of our products to do

950
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,770
that right now, but I'm
curious, like how you see

951
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,397
this cycle working in a more
well understood situation

952
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,890
and the role that you see agents playing

953
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,410
or how you're even using them now.

954
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,500
- Yeah, so I've talked a
lot about different agent

955
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,110
interplays in our incident
management lifecycle now.

956
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,630
So whether it happened
to be the filtration

957
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,240
through noise reduction
to the additional context

958
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,380
and understanding to the,
maybe I didn't mention it,

959
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,830
but the automation of
status updates as well,

960
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,840
those all factor into that life cycle.

961
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,670
I think if I were to broadcast out

962
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,670
by three, six, maybe 12 months out,

963
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,260
almost seeing a fully AI
landed incident management

964
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,290
lifecycle whereby an incident
is automatically identified

965
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,290
through alerts, threshold-driven
incident management,

966
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,760
incident generation to status updates

967
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,590
being generated automatically,

968
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,110
and then you end up having
people still in the middle mostly

969
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,570
for that thumbs up of,
hey, this looks good

970
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,496
to make sure things that move through.

971
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:29,250
When it comes to mitigations,

972
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,440
mitigations to me are
still in a little bit

973
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,730
of a scary space, right?

974
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,010
I don't think anyone here is going

975
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,280
to give an agent cube cuddle access

976
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,373
with admin credentials
right off the bat, right?

977
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,770
Maybe, maybe not.

978
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,760
Many of you may be much
more daring than I am,

979
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,590
but it's certainly not something

980
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,510
that I've would necessarily
hand directly to an agent.

981
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,900
Now, if you happen to have
workflows that are well-defined,

982
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,120
that may be in your operational toolkit

983
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,860
that you can hand off to the agent

984
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,020
whereby this is a safe action

985
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,780
and it happens to have
appropriate guardrails set up,

986
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,150
that would be a good place to start.

987
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,530
You know, just giving admin

988
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,480
and full create, update,
delete capabilities,

989
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,800
dangerous domain at this point.

990
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,590
So, what we're doing is
actually investing a lot

991
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,930
in what those workflows are right now

992
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,050
for things like being able to
shift traffic between regions

993
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:26,433
for being able to restart pods
and things along those lines.

994
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,550
- You know, it's interesting,
I don't know if any

995
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,320
of the folks in the room were like, yeah,

996
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,880
I would do that to his question,

997
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,465
but I think people internally

998
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:38,730
and people across different
companies might also have

999
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,000
different interpretations
of what is risky versus

1000
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,960
what is not risky to
have an agent help with.

1001
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,930
And I'm curious, like, you know,

1002
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,610
you talk about customer trust in relation

1003
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,410
to reliability and customer experience,

1004
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,070
but how do you think we can internally

1005
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,490
and how do you internally
help people build trust

1006
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,330
with the agents to know which
actions should be taken versus

1007
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,790
which should be left to the human?

1008
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,640
- Oh, well I think the good
news is is that assuming

1009
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,470
that you have an application

1010
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,630
or systems that have been
in production for a while

1011
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,200
and have had a history of
incidents in the past is,

1012
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,940
unless you're a startup
that hasn't launched yet,

1013
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,853
you're going to be there at
some point in time, right?

1014
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,870
We all have a huge test bed effectively

1015
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,190
that we can point agents at

1016
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,760
and we can do back testing
associated with that, too.

1017
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,220
So as I've been talking

1018
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,870
through these different agentic solutions

1019
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,150
that we're utilizing internally, many

1020
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,760
of those we have then utilized internally

1021
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,760
and pointed at historical
incidents to validate,

1022
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,610
do they provide the same
response as what we did

1023
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,810
as a part of that incident?

1024
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,480
So that severity
classification matrix agent

1025
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,313
that I was talking about before,

1026
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,960
before getting started with
that, we ran through a number

1027
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,610
of different incidents that were submitted

1028
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,260
by customer support, by a
product, by other engineers,

1029
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,440
and parse that into the agent

1030
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,260
and then validated did it
come out with a severity

1031
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,240
that we eventually landed at.

1032
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,830
Similarly, you have different types

1033
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,300
of status updates and information.

1034
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,820
You know, incident history is something

1035
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,360
that we all have and most
of us have a very durable

1036
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,280
data set that you can play with.

1037
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,220
So you can leverage that to
your advantage with building

1038
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,960
that trust in the agent

1039
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,660
because you can tweak the agent,
you can adjust the prompts

1040
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,050
and the set that's associated
with them to improve

1041
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,693
that accuracy as much as
you're comfortable with.

1042
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,290
- So, when you do start building trust,

1043
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,480
and I imagine the trust
will increase over time,

1044
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,570
it might decrease in certain
areas depending on, you know,

1045
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,570
the nuance and novel
situations that we run into.

1046
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,400
How do you see, you know,

1047
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,110
the post-incident review process

1048
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,580
playing a role in that world?

1049
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,400
- Yeah, so, this is an
area that I'm really,

1050
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,040
really excited about because
I think we've got a huge

1051
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,630
opportunity for leveraging
agents in not only the generation

1052
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,630
of post-incident reviews,
but also in adjustments

1053
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,170
to those agents based on those
incident reviews themselves.

1054
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,003
- Hmm.

1055
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,200
- So let's dive into maybe the opportunity

1056
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,585
for the post-incident review first.

1057
00:45:17,585 --> 00:45:20,182
You mentioned it multiple times already.

1058
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:22,590
Incidents are complicated.

1059
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,270
Creating status updates are complicated.

1060
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,460
Creating a incident review for something

1061
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,540
that took about an hour

1062
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,870
and a half to resolve,
incredibly complicated.

1063
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,390
One of the most valuable things
that you can do as a part

1064
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,230
of a incident review process
is construct a timeline,

1065
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,360
an accurate timeline
of what was happening.

1066
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,220
And that can be very, very tough

1067
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,690
because you're relying on humans

1068
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,630
to reconstruct information
based on historical metrics,

1069
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,930
logs, conversations, you name it.

1070
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,290
You throw an agent at that
history, at a transcript,

1071
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,720
at that information, it can print out

1072
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,500
and create a timeline
very quickly for you.

1073
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,100
And something that would've
taken a operator engineer hours

1074
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,560
and hours to create, an
agent can crank it out

1075
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,780
in a minute or so, right?

1076
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,670
So, huge value in being able to do that

1077
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,790
and unearth a lot of learning
that people just won't be able

1078
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,480
to do themselves because
you've got a short term cache

1079
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,400
and that short term
cache can become corrupt.

1080
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,500
And you can remember,
you can misunderstand

1081
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,260
and not fully see how things panned out,

1082
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,330
but an agent will actually
pull through a lot

1083
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,010
of the information, assuming that you have

1084
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,900
that information handy.

1085
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,400
And it can also point out things

1086
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,070
that you might not have
understood to begin with.

1087
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,897
So this is an area that
we are investing in

1088
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:37,290
and being able to pull in
some of this information,

1089
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,330
whether it be through
transcripts, whether it be

1090
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,570
through chat logs, et cetera,
to synthesize that timeline

1091
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,890
to be able to better understand

1092
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,090
what happened during an incident.

1093
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,330
We found that that has
been very beneficial,

1094
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,040
especially for some of our most severe

1095
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,083
and most complicated incidents so far.

1096
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,640
Now, the additional benefit
is being able to then turn

1097
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,350
that reflection back on the agents,

1098
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,030
because as you're going back

1099
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,320
and you're utilizing agents

1100
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,760
for your incident response
process, you'll also want to use

1101
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,460
that post-incident review to understand

1102
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,900
how you can improve your agents.

1103
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,270
Again, going back to tweaking
of prompts, being able

1104
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,700
to understand, did we get
the same status update

1105
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,160
that we wanted as a part of this output?

1106
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,590
Was it recommending the remediation

1107
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,510
that we expected at the end of the day?

1108
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,360
So, big benefit in that space too.

1109
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,010
- Yeah, and even, you know,

1110
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,930
taking those learnings into the beginning

1111
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,300
of the software development
life as well, even

1112
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,540
before an incident takes
place, just to have some

1113
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,290
of that context, I could see being useful.

1114
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,123
- Absolutely.

1115
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:39,750
One of the first use cases

1116
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,180
that we explored was
actually pointing an agent

1117
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,770
to our historical post
incident review report library.

1118
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,420
You know, we've got dozens of those

1119
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,020
and we wanted to better
understand systemic issues.

1120
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,330
Typically, when folks go
into a post incident review,

1121
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,100
and I'm not gonna ask you to
raise your hands, I've done

1122
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,470
that like 12 times so far during this,

1123
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,290
but most of you have
probably been in a situation

1124
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,270
where you've got blinders on, right?

1125
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,190
Where you're focused on this incident,

1126
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,290
you may not be thinking about an incident

1127
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,210
that happened a week
ago, or three weeks ago,

1128
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,580
or four weeks ago, or
potentially an incident

1129
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,350
in a completely different business domain.

1130
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,420
Oh, but there's a connection between them.

1131
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,130
There's some similarities.

1132
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,965
So, what we started doing early on

1133
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,480
was pointing agents toward

1134
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,010
this incident review library
to tease out what are some

1135
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,480
of these commonalities.

1136
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,240
One of the questions that we asked was,

1137
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,360
why aren't we auto detecting
as many incidents as we want?

1138
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,910
We have too many manually
detected incidents.

1139
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,400
So what the agent was able
to do was actually parse

1140
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,190
through hundreds of incident reports

1141
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,980
and was able to unearth through
the unstructured narratives

1142
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,640
that folks had provided to
indicate that, hey, it isn't

1143
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,150
because we aren't alerting on 500 errors

1144
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,180
or latency metrics or
anything along those lines,

1145
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,180
but we were actually running
into a lot of novel situations

1146
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,950
where we would have, what
would be considered appropriate

1147
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:05,160
business reactions that
were inappropriately placed.

1148
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,430
We were hiding a UI element
when we shouldn't have.

1149
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:11,070
It wasn't an error scenario,
it was just a inappropriate use

1150
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,680
of a particular requirement
in that circumstance.

1151
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,780
So what we were able to
do was take that back

1152
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,880
and then start thinking about

1153
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,540
how do we translate those
requirements into a stronger error

1154
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,220
signal, and are there areas

1155
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,590
where we could potentially
have mismatch requirements

1156
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,390
where we aren't generating a 500

1157
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,550
or an error log in those scenarios.

1158
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,200
So those were some of the
ways that we were able

1159
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,390
to take some value out of that.

1160
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,310
- How did you, you know, with the patterns

1161
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:38,040
that you saw in the
opportunities for improvement,

1162
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,970
how did you prioritize
some of those changes?

1163
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,240
- Yeah, so a big part of what we do

1164
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,660
within our operational
excellence program is we

1165
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,900
run a weekly operational
excellence business review

1166
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,260
where we'll actually reflect on all

1167
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,930
of our operational measures,
whether it's time to mitigate,

1168
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:01,380
time to acknowledge, auto detection rate,

1169
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,910
but we also use this as an opportunity

1170
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,940
to share operational learnings
across our engineering

1171
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,530
organization because we have members

1172
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,910
of our service development teams

1173
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,880
from across the board
present during these.

1174
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,920
So at the very end of some
of these sessions, we would

1175
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,360
share the learnings, we
would drive the action items,

1176
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,980
we would then align these

1177
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,990
to typically the actual celebration

1178
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,200
or post-incident review
processes and those action items.

1179
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,150
We actually had SLAs that are defined

1180
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,460
for when they're expected to be completed.

1181
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,530
So we were able to roll

1182
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,380
that into the operational
excellence program itself,

1183
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,900
attach them as action items to COEs,

1184
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,630
and then let the process
take it off from there.

1185
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,583
- Awesome.

1186
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,530
You know, you've talked about a few things

1187
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,310
that you are doing with
agents and your operations,

1188
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,390
and you talked about a few things that

1189
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,890
are going to be going forward.

1190
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:54,390
What are you most excited
about on your AI roadmap?

1191
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,390
- Yeah, so I think going
back to the ability

1192
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:02,190
to have agents interface
with all of our data sets

1193
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,330
and to an extent run an
incident almost on autopilot,

1194
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,093
going back to what I was saying before,

1195
00:51:08,093 --> 00:51:12,450
getting to a point where
post incident detection,

1196
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,170
an agent can quickly analyze
your observability data.

1197
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,230
Let's say that's one agent
pointed toward MCP servers

1198
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,020
for things like Amazon managed
Prometheus, OpenSearch,

1199
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,240
another that happens to
be pointed to data points

1200
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,070
associated with recent deployments.

1201
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,190
Another pointed to data for, you know,

1202
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,810
previous post-incident reviews

1203
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:33,390
and runbooks, you
effectively have your own

1204
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,820
mini operations team at your disposal.

1205
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,653
- Yeah.

1206
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:38,190
- And you just need a human
in the loop to make sure

1207
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:42,030
that there's no goofiness
that's happening in the mix.

1208
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,070
But that's no different than what we do

1209
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,500
with people today, right?

1210
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,850
We have individuals

1211
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,530
that are looking at the operational data,

1212
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,360
they have their own context,

1213
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,850
they have their own understanding
of what's happening,

1214
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,100
and you still have these
coordination pieces.

1215
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,680
So, agents help step in

1216
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,170
and help out as a part
of that process, too.

1217
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,003
- Amazing.

1218
00:52:02,003 --> 00:52:05,160
Well, we've had a lot of discussion today

1219
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,180
around how we can leverage AI

1220
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,760
and automation more
readily in our operations,

1221
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,040
especially when we've had
organizations that have been

1222
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,390
around for a long time too,

1223
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,130
and we have maybe developed things

1224
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,057
that didn't use that, right?

1225
00:52:18,057 --> 00:52:20,460
And so we're evolving over time.

1226
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,880
And so if, you know, we
had to summarize today,

1227
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,850
some of the key things
I think you shared, one

1228
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:30,450
of them were pointing LLMs
towards your history, right?

1229
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,160
Towards your previous incidents

1230
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,830
and your process in order to build trust,

1231
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:38,790
but also some of this might
not be visible to the human eye

1232
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,860
and it might help point to things

1233
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,840
that we might not be recognizing,

1234
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,810
which it sounds like you did
in the last example you gave.

1235
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,680
- Yeah, absolutely.

1236
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,290
There is a treasure trove of learning

1237
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,600
that you all are already sitting on.

1238
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,130
I can guarantee you that.

1239
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,900
And if you start pointing agents to that,

1240
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,160
they can help you unearth that.

1241
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,070
And going back to that
example that I gave you,

1242
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,780
it would've taken hours,
days, frankly, for an analyst

1243
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,180
to parse through all of
that information themselves.

1244
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,943
We were able to do that
effectively in an hour. Right?

1245
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,823
- Yeah,

1246
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:12,510
- So, huge benefit in that space. Right.

1247
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,390
- And, a key thing throughout
our entire conversation

1248
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,910
today was the foundational data set

1249
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:21,270
that you invested in right
at the very beginning

1250
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:25,740
and how imperative that is
to even be able to use AI

1251
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,280
so that you are getting quality outputs

1252
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,900
and aligning folks around that.

1253
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,550
And, that can actually end
up increasing the frequency

1254
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,090
of being in well understood
situations rather than treating

1255
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,590
them as if they're new and novel

1256
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,420
and interrupting people's time.

1257
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,120
- Yeah, absolutely, I mean, structure

1258
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,330
and organization makes things
more efficient, not just

1259
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,820
for humans, but also
artificial intelligence

1260
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,320
and automation as well.

1261
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,710
So, establishing that foundation,
building that vernacular

1262
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,720
and classification capability,

1263
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,177
while some may say it's boring, I love it.

1264
00:54:00,177 --> 00:54:02,100
I'm a nerd in that way.

1265
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,050
It is something that pays off

1266
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,480
dividends at the end of the day.

1267
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,390
- Yeah, it helps everyone
run more smoothly

1268
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,110
and probably, not just resolve
incidents more quickly,

1269
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,180
but develop things more quickly as well,

1270
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,600
because you're operating
under a baseline expectation

1271
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,613
that is, you know, roughly the same.

1272
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,280
And, a lot of folks already
have current incident processes

1273
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,420
that they're using and maybe evolving

1274
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,443
and you did as well, right?

1275
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,150
And you had mentioned using agents

1276
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,770
to reduce context switching

1277
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,930
and coordination costs, like using agents

1278
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,350
to maybe catch up on what's
going on with a situation

1279
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:47,370
or remember the processes
to follow as well.

1280
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,640
How would you recommend
others think about that?

1281
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,750
- Yeah, so I would take a look
at your incident lifecycle

1282
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,430
and see what are the points

1283
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:59,070
where you are seeing the
most toil, the things

1284
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:03,030
that are distracting from the
point of mitigation, right?

1285
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,310
Top priority has to be
mitigate the incident.

1286
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,720
Those are things like communication.

1287
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,430
Those are things like that individual

1288
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,410
or leader that joins the bridge

1289
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,720
and asks for a status update
that brings everything

1290
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,250
to a screeching halt, right?

1291
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,000
The more you can put agents
in automation in play

1292
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,770
to be able to mitigate
that and keep folks focused

1293
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:24,960
with their eyes on the
prize, the better off.

1294
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,940
So, I think for many companies,

1295
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,090
you've got this opportunity
to start pointing agents

1296
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:33,360
to those conversations, point
agents toward that data,

1297
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,400
point agents toward those incident reviews

1298
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,760
from past history to be
able to provide input

1299
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,790
and start chipping away at
the toil that's associated

1300
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,130
with the incident management lifecycle.

1301
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,120
- Amazing.

1302
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,060
Well, we have about three minutes left,

1303
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,080
so we probably have
time for some questions

1304
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,080
if folks have any for Tom
or about some of what-

1305
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,053
- [Tom] Nora, too.

1306
00:55:58,053 --> 00:55:59,050
- [Nora] We've been implementing.

1307
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,210
- This is so exciting.

1308
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:06,000
So, we're actually in the process

1309
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,430
of rolling out a new
service health framework

1310
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,293
across all of our applications.

1311
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,740
This is a standardized way of being able

1312
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:18,210
to author service level objectives
across our microservices,

1313
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,400
their infrastructure, and then roll that

1314
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,470
up to the CUJ level as well.

1315
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,750
Because our end goal is to be able

1316
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,060
to understand the historical health

1317
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,750
and wellbeing of everything from the level

1318
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:34,110
of customer impact, all the
way to the smallest level

1319
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,880
of microservice at the end of the day.

1320
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,810
So, the framework enables us
to define, quite simply, like

1321
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,800
what our healthy responses,
what are unhealthy responses,

1322
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,550
and then being able to use that,

1323
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,250
create percentage based styles associated

1324
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,760
with those service level
objectives based on the mapping

1325
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,010
to the CUJs and the
tiering of the services

1326
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:57,000
that would then correlate
back into automated incident

1327
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,910
severity generation in those situations.

1328
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,730
So, you know, tier one
service that's attached

1329
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:06,900
to our playback capability,
if it's violating its SLO,

1330
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,690
SEV Two, potential, easy escalation

1331
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,540
up to a SEV One in that circumstance.

1332
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,350
- All right, well we are at time,

1333
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,200
but thank you so much,
Tom, for your time today

1334
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,600
and for your partnership in general.

1335
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,160
Really appreciate it and thank you,

1336
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,360
everyone for joining today.

1337
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,636
- Thank you.

1338
00:57:25,636 --> 00:57:28,375
(audience applauds)
