1
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:03,420
(indistinct chattering)

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,460
- Okay, so before we get started,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,320
I want to touch base a little bit

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,780
about what is multi-channel marketing

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,080
and what does it, what
are some of the challenges

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,750
that are associated with
multi-channel marketing

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,090
and how agentic AI can help in solving

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,980
some of those challenges?

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,680
So, multi-channel marketing

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,680
is a customer centric
strat, marketing strategy

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,700
where you are providing
seamless integrated experiences

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,040
to your customers at the touchpoints

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,690
where they are interacting

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,550
with your particular brand, right?

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,710
And at the same time, you need to ensure

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,280
that there is consistent messaging
across all these channels

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,330
that they're interacting with your brand.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,600
So, let's take a look at some

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,010
of the challenges that come with it.

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,843
You know, when it comes

21
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:49,710
to automating multi-channel marketing

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,840
and how agentic AI can help.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,157
And I will cover what
does agentic AI mean,

24
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:56,730
you know, how we evolved into agentic AI

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,040
and all those details
in the upcoming slides.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,290
So first, let's look at
the business problem.

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,810
So, the first challenge

28
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,730
with multi-channel marketing automation

29
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,190
is associated with the workflows

30
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,390
that you need to orchestrate.

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,070
You know, there are
different customer journeys,

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,517
there are multiple channels, there are,

33
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:15,150
you know, different
touchpoints for your customers.

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,100
And how do you ensure that,

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,510
you know, you have this overall workflow,

36
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,890
you know, deployed in a way

37
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,780
that it is flexible enough, right?

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,740
With traditional workflows,
they're kind of too rigid

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,350
and they're like, you know,
sticking to a particular script.

40
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,680
But whereas when it
comes to agentic AI based

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,380
or agentic AI enabled workflows,

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,370
you will have the flexibility
to have multiple agents,

43
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,620
you know, coordinating with
each other in real time.

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,350
And they can even have,
like, specialized agents

45
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,500
that are built for specific
marketing channels.

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,080
You can also have dynamic workflow.

47
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,580
Let's say your customer responses

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,170
and behavior is a little bit different

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,190
than what what is expected
the agentic AI based workflow

50
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,370
can adopt based on your customer behavior.

51
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,520
And you can also have
cross-channel context preservation

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,530
and you can deliver consistent messaging

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,720
across all these channels
that you're trying

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,553
to reach them on.

55
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,920
You know, whether it be
email, SMS, you know, online,

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,773
you know, web personalization,
social media and so on.

57
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,310
Then there is the challenge of,

58
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,050
you know, real-time personalization,

59
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,280
whatever that you're delivering,

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,340
the messaging that you're
delivering to your customers,

61
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,890
you know, personalizing
to those customers.

62
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,690
You have thousands of customers,

63
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,570
you know, across multiple
channels when you,

64
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,340
when it comes to that level of, you know,

65
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,880
that kind of a scale, agentic
AI can definitely help

66
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,380
in that situation.

67
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,407
With the traditional systems that,

68
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:44,550
you know, they usually lack the ability

69
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,990
to deal with those kind of things.

70
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,240
And, you know, the complexity
that comes with it.

71
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,900
So, with agentic AI based systems,

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,050
you can have intelligent
content generation.

73
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,900
So, depending on the
particular customer segment

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,520
and customer behavior and so on,

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
you can dynamically generate

76
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,120
what specific content makes sense

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
for that particular customer

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,240
and that particular channel.

79
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,300
You can also do real-time
decision making in terms

80
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,440
of, okay, the customer
is more interacting on,

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
through email, you know,
or they're more interacting

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,150
on social media platforms.

83
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,750
So, depending on the kind of
interactions that you're seeing

84
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,280
and observing for your customers,

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,670
you can switch between
different channels as necessary.

86
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,130
And you can also have brand guardrails,

87
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,620
baked into the AI agents themselves.

88
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,760
That way you have that brand
consistency and compliance,

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,590
you know, already built into the AI agents

90
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,440
and you don't have to worry about it.

91
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,300
So, the next challenge is with,

92
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,460
you know, with any typical enterprise,

93
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,070
you know, you see these data silos,

94
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,860
you know, data sitting
across your CRM systems,

95
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,580
your e-commerce systems, your
your data analytics systems

96
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,020
and so on and so forth.

97
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,520
And looking at it all this
data in a holistic way

98
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,193
and acting upon the data, the
customer data that you are,

99
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:04,290
that you have across all these systems

100
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,600
is pretty complicated in nature.

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,540
Where agentic AI can help is build

102
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,300
that unified data point of view.

103
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,700
You know, you can have
APIs and MCP Servers

104
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,940
that are exposing the data
from these individual systems

105
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,080
and agents can actually get all the data

106
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,220
from these different systems,

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,080
associated with a specific customer

108
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,670
and identify their behavior

109
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,770
and the patterns associated with them.

110
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,410
You can also have things
like data cleansing,

111
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,600
you know, there may be certain places

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
where you need to cleanse data

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,890
that is coming from your CRM
system or some other system,

114
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,540
or you may have to do some data mapping

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,860
between different systems.

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,770
All those things you can
automagically achieve

117
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,123
using agentic AI.

118
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,500
Then there is the Speed to Market

119
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,240
and Campaign Agility aspect of it, right?

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,130
So, traditional, if you look

121
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,630
at traditional marketing campaigns,

122
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,030
they take a lot of time to set up, right?

123
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,820
You know, whether it be
the content generation,

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,620
whether it be, you know,
think of how to customize it,

125
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,220
what are the target or segmented audience

126
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,220
that we are targeting at that
particular point in time.

127
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,470
All those things, they actually take a lot

128
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,760
of weeks of effort, whereas
by, and by that time

129
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,880
you would basically miss
market opportunities, right?

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,190
You know, it's gone, right?

131
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,470
With agentic AI,

132
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,470
you can have natural language
based campaign definition.

133
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,230
So, you can say, I'm
trying to target audience

134
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,100
that are like under 25 years
of age who use Instagram

135
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,250
a lot or, you know, some other
social media platform a lot

136
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,160
and living in California,
living in so and so city.

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,070
And you just provide the definition

138
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,470
of the campaign in a natural language way

139
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,810
and the agents will be
able to understand that,

140
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,420
identify the right audience,
identify the right content

141
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,060
that needs to be generated and so on.

142
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,510
You can also have instant
campaign optimization.

143
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,060
So, let's say your performance,

144
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,320
the campaign performance data

145
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,540
is coming through, like, it is streaming

146
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,840
and you want these AI agents
to look at what is going on

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,020
and if you need to optimize
then and there, you can do that.

148
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,833
You can have that real-time
campaign optimization in place.

149
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,580
And then there is the, one of the biggest

150
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,950
of the challenges is the Attribution

151
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,920
and ROI Measurement Across
all these Touchpoints.

152
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,270
So, it's not single touchpoints.

153
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,400
So, you have these emails
that are going out,

154
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,470
those SMS messages that are going out,

155
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,810
they're interacting with
your brand at a store.

156
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,630
So, there are so many
different touchpoints

157
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,180
at which your customers are
interacting with your brand.

158
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,780
So, with agentic AI, you can have

159
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,720
that intelligent attribution modeling

160
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,810
that accounts for all these different,

161
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,930
you know, touchpoints and all
the complex customer journeys

162
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,090
across all these touchpoints.

163
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,790
You can also have
real-time ROI optimization.

164
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,390
So, you can actually see where

165
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,680
or which particular channel

166
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,470
is performing better
versus other channels.

167
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,130
So, let's say your marketing
campaign is targeted for like,

168
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,810
okay, I need to send 10,000 emails

169
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,910
and I need to target the same thing,

170
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,940
the same campaign on like
social media platform,

171
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,980
but you are seeing more responsiveness

172
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,260
on the social media
platform versus the email.

173
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,950
So, you can also quickly
switch between channels

174
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,230
so that it's much more optimized

175
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,583
and you are spending the right
money on the right things.

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,460
You can also perform like
predictive analytics.

177
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,940
So, even before you are executing
your marketing campaigns,

178
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,790
you can start by, you know, measuring what

179
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,510
or estimating what would be
this campaign performance

180
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,090
if I am executing across these channels,

181
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,700
if I am targeting these
particular audiences,

182
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,320
how exactly this is going to,

183
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,060
this campaign is going to perform, right?

184
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,010
So, all those things you can bake in

185
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,083
into your agentic AI workflows.

186
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,590
All right, so I did promise
you that I will cover

187
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,500
what does agentic AI mean
in the first place, right?

188
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,133
So, and how did we evolve
into agentic AI today?

189
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,630
So, on the left hand side...

190
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,540
Yes, on the right hand side for you,

191
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,900
you'll see the low agency systems, right?

192
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,940
You know, these are traditional systems

193
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,890
where they're completely rule-based

194
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,430
and they require a lot of human oversight.

195
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,450
And on the extreme left side, right side,

196
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,090
you see there are high agency systems

197
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,153
which don't need much of human oversight.

198
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,590
So, traditionally, companies
have usually started,

199
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,110
like, around using rule-based RPA

200
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,270
or Robotic Process Automation,

201
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,280
which are kind of rigid in nature.

202
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,840
They're task oriented.

203
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,050
So you say, this is exactly
the task I want to accomplish.

204
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,540
These are the set of rules

205
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,400
that are associated with this task

206
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,810
and they can only focus on that

207
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,240
and they require a lot of human oversight.

208
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,060
And then came the generative AI assistance

209
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,200
where they know what they
need to do for specific tasks.

210
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,800
You are not, humans are not
significantly involved in that,

211
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,440
but they still need some
level of human oversight.

212
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,090
You can just say, this is the task

213
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,340
that you're supposed to do
and they will do it for you.

214
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,840
They, you know, think of it

215
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,540
as some examples are, like, you can have

216
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,340
these customer service chat assistance,

217
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,190
which are, you know, powered
by AI behind the scenes

218
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,250
or your, you know, intelligent
document processing.

219
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,780
You know, you can just
read through the document.

220
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,340
It is supposed to just
go through the document,

221
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,900
understand what the document contains

222
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,130
and be done with it, right?

223
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,680
So, it understands what
tasks need to be done

224
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,300
and it'll do it by itself,

225
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,920
but you still have to define the workflow.

226
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
You still have to tell that
generative AI assistant

227
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,740
what exactly it is supposed to do.

228
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,678
And then came the
goal-driven agents, right?

229
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:49,590
They're kind of the next level,

230
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,000
and this is where

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,080
we started seeing real
business transformation, right?

232
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,160
We, these things understand
what is the business objective.

233
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,530
You're not defining
individual tasks anymore.

234
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,363
You're basically saying,

235
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:05,190
"This is my business objective,
now please go do this."

236
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,390
And these agents are able
to come up with the tasks,

237
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,210
intelligent tasks, that need
to be executed, the workflow,

238
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,130
the order, and so on so forth.

239
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,220
And execute those and
accomplish those objectives

240
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,873
that you're trying to achieve.

241
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,040
And then there is a fully
autonomous agentic systems.

242
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,910
These are kind of rare today,
we don't have a lot of them,

243
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,700
but this is where, this is
the highest level of agency

244
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,430
and this is the highest level of autonomy

245
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,530
that we are working towards.

246
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,370
And these systems, they can
make strategic decisions

247
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,203
on your behalf.

248
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,680
You know, they're not just,

249
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
you know, business objective oriented.

250
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,430
Now they're able to make
decisions on your behalf,

251
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,970
interact with other agents,
interact with other tools

252
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,330
and, you know, make,
let's say, make a payment

253
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,830
on your behalf or, you
know, those kind of things.

254
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:58,680
Okay, so what does an
AI agent mean, right?

255
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,450
So, you may have heard about,

256
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,600
you know, or been using
LLMs, large language models

257
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,120
or small language models, and so on.

258
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,570
Where they lack the
ability to solve problems.

259
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,957
You know, they're like, you say,

260
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:12,750
"Okay, can you write me a poem?"

261
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,130
They'll write a poem,

262
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,690
but they don't exactly know...

263
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,840
If you say this is my
objective, go do something,

264
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,130
they will not be able to do it.

265
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,010
You have to specify what needs to be done.

266
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,920
Whereas AI agents are autonomous

267
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
or semi-autonomous software systems

268
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,190
that are able to independently plan, act

269
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,730
on your behalf with
minimal human oversight.

270
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,480
And they're also able to
interact with the environment

271
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,730
that they're in, you know,
whether it be the APIs,

272
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,070
the data sources that you have,

273
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,240
you know, all those things

274
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,603
and able to take independent
decisions on their own.

275
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,247
So, it is relatively
easy to build an agent,

276
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,780
you know, for those who have
already built AI agents,

277
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,690
you already know how easy
it is to build AI agents.

278
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,990
But when it comes to
taking them to production,

279
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,910
you know, think of all things

280
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,090
that need to happen when it needs

281
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,580
to go into production, right?

282
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,440
Think of the thousands of invocations

283
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,470
that will, potentially, happen
for that particular agent.

284
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,080
Think of the thousands of interactions

285
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,150
that this agent will have with other agent

286
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,520
and other tools as necessary.

287
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,160
All these complexities that are in place,

288
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,373
and if you have to manage your
own infrastructure for this,

289
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,250
they're not going into production, right?

290
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,960
This is where most of the customers

291
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
are like building AI agents.

292
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,460
They're doing prototypes and
not taking them to production.

293
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,000
And that's where Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore services

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,903
come into picture.

295
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,340
So, AgentCore services let you
build, deploy, scale, secure

296
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,910
and observe your AI agents in production.

297
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,890
And you can use any agentic framework.

298
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,690
So, if you're familiar with LangGraph

299
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,780
or, you know, CrewAI, Strands,

300
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,400
all these different agentic frameworks,

301
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,900
you can use any framework

302
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,970
and you can also use any LLM, right?

303
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,940
You can use, you know,
the Bedrock based models,

304
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,860
whether it be the cloud models and so on.

305
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
You can use OpenAI models,
you can use Gemini models,

306
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,140
you can use anything that you want, right?

307
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,113
That's the flexibility that
AgentCore services provide you.

308
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,730
So, AgentCore is a set
of modular services,

309
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,710
which you can use all of them

310
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,040
or some of them as necessary
for your particular situation.

311
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,350
You don't have to use
every service out there,

312
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,570
you just pick and choose
the ones that make sense

313
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,423
for your particular
agentic AI application.

314
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,730
The first one out of the
services is AgentCore Runtime.

315
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,580
So, runtime allows, as the name suggests,

316
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,580
it allows you to run your
AI agents and MCP servers

317
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,770
and it is completely or
fully managed service.

318
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,960
You're not managing any
of the infrastructure.

319
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,430
You're only purely focused on
what your AI agent needs to do

320
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,867
and the code associated with it,

321
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:05,400
and you go deploy it in there
and it is secure in nature.

322
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,910
You, you know, it has
its own session isolation

323
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,140
and other capabilities.

324
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,150
Also there are data
protection capabilities

325
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,530
and all those things that come,

326
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,990
baked in into the runtime itself.

327
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,860
You can have real-time interactive agents

328
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,120
or you can have long running agents,

329
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,023
agents that may be running up
to eight hours of duration.

330
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,580
Then there is the
AgentCore Identity service,

331
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,420
which allows your AI
agents to securely interact

332
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,800
with their other services,

333
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,590
whether it be your enterprise APIs

334
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,350
or, you know, other
services, like, whether

335
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,870
it be interacting with
your Salesforce or Slack

336
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,320
or, you know, Google, you
know, all these GitHub,

337
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,360
all these things that
are external services

338
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,980
as well can be accessed securely
using AgentCore Identity.

339
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,080
It basically reduces,
you know, when you think

340
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,810
of authentication
authorization lifecycle, right?

341
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,840
You know your AI agent,
let's say it needs to go talk

342
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,460
to Salesforce.

343
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,920
First, the user has to authenticate,

344
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,680
then there needs to be some
level of token exchange

345
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,767
that is happening between
Salesforce and the user itself.

346
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,740
You know, you got the token,

347
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,640
but now that token has to
be passed to your AI agent

348
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,770
to go continue doing the work, right?

349
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,710
So, all those, storing those,

350
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,020
you know, tokens in a secure world,

351
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,880
making sure that only the agent

352
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,440
that is supposed to access the token

353
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,400
is able to access it, you
know, and reusing tokens

354
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,270
as necessary.

355
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,710
These tokens don't just expire, right?

356
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,770
You know, sometimes you
have longer duration tokens,

357
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,610
one hour, two hour,

358
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,830
whatever the job tokens that you generate.

359
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,780
So, depending on that, you know,

360
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,300
and you don't have to write
even a single piece of code.

361
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,970
All that you do is you'll reference couple

362
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,450
of decorator functions
of AgentCode Identity

363
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,937
and you will be able to,

364
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,590
all the boiler plate
code that is necessary

365
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,600
for authentication
authorization will go away.

366
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
So, that reduces the
amount of development time

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,090
that is required for you to
take your agent to production.

368
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,190
You're not writing any
piece of code over there,

369
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,080
you're just using inbuilt capabilities.

370
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,170
And the beauty of it is
it already integrates

371
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,290
with some of the, you
know, identity providers,

372
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,780
whether it be your Okta, your Cognito,

373
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,113
you know, think of Entra ID and so on.

374
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,430
Then there is the AgentCode Gateway,

375
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,900
which provides a secure
mechanism to integrate

376
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,310
with your existing, you know,
APIs and Lambda functions

377
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,040
or even external services and so on.

378
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,980
And what it does is it is acting

379
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,190
as a name suggests, it
is acting as a gateway

380
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,050
between all your APIs

381
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,510
and it can convert those APIs

382
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,510
into MCP compatible tools.

383
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,310
So, you don't have

384
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,360
to build your own MCP
servers in front of your APIs

385
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,730
and Lambda functions
and other AWS services.

386
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,290
You can just leverage
Bedrock AgentCode gateway

387
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,980
so that, you know, it just
helps you with that MCP exposure

388
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,510
and your agents are able to talk

389
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,063
to that MCP through that protocol.

390
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,680
It also allows for like, you know,

391
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,490
let's say you have thousands
of APIs across your enterprise

392
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,600
and most of them you're trying

393
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,963
to convert them into MCP
servers and tools basically.

394
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,950
When the tool collection keeps growing

395
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,200
and when your agent is trying to go find

396
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,300
what are all the tools that are available,

397
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,430
you know, it, the context window

398
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,710
for your agent keeps getting bloated up

399
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,100
and, you know, you don't wanna do that.

400
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,500
Where Gateway shines is it provides you

401
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,540
with a semantic search
kind of a capability

402
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,570
where the agent will say, "Hey,
I'm trying to send an email,

403
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,280
can you give me a tool
associated with it?"

404
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,290
And Gateway will pick and
choose the specific tools

405
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,000
that make sense for signing an email

406
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,850
and expose only those
tools with, to the agent

407
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,380
so that your agent context window

408
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,173
is not bloating up or go going overblown.

409
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,350
Then there is the AgentCore Memory.

410
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,670
So, in case if you want to have memory,

411
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,040
you know, associated with your AI agents

412
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,160
and you want to store
and retrieve information

413
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,830
across multiple sessions
of your or invocations

414
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,500
of your AI agents, you
can leverage memory.

415
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,040
It has both short term and
long term memory capabilities.

416
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,590
So, depending on what
information you want to store,

417
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,510
what type of AI agent you're building

418
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,570
and whether it requires
some level of data retention

419
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,510
for, you know, some level of chat history

420
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,730
or whatever your agent is doing,

421
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,472
if it requires memory,
the AgentCore Memory

422
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,053
will help you with that.

423
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,280
And then finally there is
a AgentCore Observability.

424
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,850
This is a fully managed
ability or service,

425
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,110
sorry, which will help you to take

426
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,960
that single pane of
glass of kind of a view

427
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,718
into what exactly your AI agent is doing.

428
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,590
What model it is calling,
how many tokens are used,

429
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,965
what are the inputs, what are the outputs,

430
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,350
what tools it is calling or
MCP service that it is calling.

431
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,070
So, you get that auditability
and observability,

432
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,010
right in the service itself

433
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,230
and some of the frameworks like Strands

434
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,310
and all these things, they already

435
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,690
have those things baked in

436
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,200
and all the logs, metrics, traces

437
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,630
are open telemetry compatible.

438
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,190
So, if you want to push those logs

439
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,150
into CloudWatch or Datadog
or Cloudsmith, Langfuse,

440
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,093
you know, all those different
tools you can do so.

441
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:34,080
With that said, I will like to hand it out

442
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
to Jiten, he'll cover the
architecture patterns.

443
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,950
- Thank you Sandeep for covering

444
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,930
the marketing automation challenges

445
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,843
and the what and whys of AgentCore.

446
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,750
Hi, I'm Jiten Dedhia.

447
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm a Senior Solution
Architect specializing with AI,

448
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,240
ML and GenAI.

449
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,500
I cover the advertising

450
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,783
and marketing industry across the US.

451
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,700
Just with the show of hand,

452
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,070
I'd just like to know how many of you guys

453
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,373
are from advertising marketing industry?

454
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay, just few of them.

455
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,130
So, good thing is whatever
I'm going to cover

456
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,130
or while it may have focus
on advertising marketing,

457
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,280
it is going to be
applicable across the board.

458
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,640
So, any of your use case,
financial services, life sciences,

459
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,220
everything is going to be applicable.

460
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,570
Same thing.

461
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,640
What I'm going to do is deep dive

462
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,060
on how to use AgentCore

463
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,780
or how to use agent, multi-agent system.

464
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,680
What are the patterns?

465
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,810
What are important things to consider

466
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,110
and will deep dive into
those aspects of it.

467
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,270
In particular, we'll start with like agent

468
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,650
to agent communication,

469
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,070
what are the options of
pros and cons for that?

470
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,770
Then we'll go into security aspect of it

471
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,790
and finally like multi-tenancy
and observability.

472
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,800
So, let's take a distributed
communication system, right?

473
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,810
Like, multi-agent system.

474
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,850
The communication is
like the nervous system

475
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,883
of the brain of it.

476
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,460
Here what we are have is
multiple agents are shown here.

477
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,050
These are marketing related agent,

478
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,780
but, as I said, like it
they could be any agent.

479
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,370
As Sandeep has referenced,

480
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,040
these agents could be
built using any framework.

481
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,500
So, one thing we are propagating

482
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,140
is that don't necessarily
restrict your team

483
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,540
to using one kind of framework.

484
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,830
You could use LangGraph.

485
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,300
Some teams could use LangGraph,

486
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,980
others could use Strands, right?

487
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,930
And it's perfectly cohesive system.

488
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,780
They can talk to each other very smoothly

489
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,790
within AgentCore Runtime.

490
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,140
So, that's not a restriction.

491
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,520
Now if you want to standardize

492
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,130
as an enterprise on one thing, it's fine,

493
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,780
but it doesn't have to be,

494
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,993
and that's something you
need to realize with this.

495
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,790
Here you see like an user, he's
going to typically interact

496
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,550
with an application, maybe
an existing application,

497
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,750
maybe a new application.

498
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,150
It could be chat or it could be a web app.

499
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,820
And then what the application
is going to do is,

500
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,130
that is the application
going to communicate with one

501
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,404
of the agents or multiple of these?

502
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,600
In many scenarios you will see

503
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,310
that there is an orchestrator agent.

504
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,430
So, the application hands
off to the orchestrator

505
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,370
and then the orchestrator is
going to decide who it needs

506
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,150
to talk to, when it should talk
to each one of these agents.

507
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,500
Now, let's see, how can it
talk to these agents, right?

508
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,560
So the, we have few options here.

509
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,140
You can see here there's Boto3

510
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,300
and then there is A-2-A, right?

511
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,540
So, let's say the application first calls

512
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,290
using a Boto3 API, it invokes
the orchestrator agent.

513
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,540
The orchestrator agent now has a choice.

514
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,660
It can use Boto3 APIs to
invoke the other agent.

515
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,450
It can use A-2-A communication.

516
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,010
When would you use which one?

517
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,843
Right?

518
00:22:53,843 --> 00:22:56,670
As an enterprise you need to
standardize, not necessarily.

519
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,298
AWS Boto3 will give you
builtin retry logic.

520
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,190
Will give you error handling,

521
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,220
some of those native things
that you're used to, right?

522
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,290
It'll make your life simpler.

523
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,660
When would you use A-2-A then?

524
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,690
A-2-A is going to be an
open source protocol.

525
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,480
So if you want to
standardize on open source.

526
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,070
What if you have agents out,

527
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,680
living outside of AWS
that you need to call?

528
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,350
Maybe those cases are when
you would typically go

529
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,903
for an A-2-A kind of approach.

530
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,330
Now, imagine a world,

531
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,790
and this probably is true for many of you

532
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,550
who have been building agents for a while.

533
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,080
Before AgentCore came out,

534
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,969
before deploying it to AgentCore,

535
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:42,570
what you would typically
do is maybe you have

536
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,800
an ECS container, or EKS, or Kubernetes,

537
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,740
like, where you would've
written your LangGraph agent

538
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,360
and you would've deployed it there.

539
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,420
Now, these are, those agents
legacy agents as I call it.

540
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,290
They're still there and you
start building new agents

541
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,447
and you start deploying them in AgentCode.

542
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,870
They need to talk to the old agent as well

543
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,110
and that's where probably
you would use APIs

544
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,750
to make the call to those agent.

545
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,030
You'll write a tool
within one of your agents

546
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,320
or the orchestrator agent,

547
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,900
and that tool may call out as an API

548
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,560
to these other agents
which are sitting in ECS

549
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,763
or any other container.

550
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,810
Then we take the next case.

551
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,700
So, here is where it gets

552
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,980
a little bit more complex use case,

553
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,400
but this is a real life
enterprise situation.

554
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,270
There are multiple
teams developing agents.

555
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,670
There are reasons where you will need

556
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,860
to use multiple AWS account.

557
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,860
So, maybe some of your agents
are deployed in this account,

558
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,460
others in this and another
in a third account, right?

559
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,290
When are those use cases?

560
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,410
One, as I said, is
there are multiple teams

561
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,760
who are developing them.

562
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,170
So, for ownership purposes,

563
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,110
for cost allocation
purposes, you need that.

564
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,670
But then there are use cases

565
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,920
where, let's say, you have a database

566
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,040
which is sitting in, on account A

567
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,770
and your agent needs
to interact with that.

568
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,440
So, in that case you
may want to, your agent,

569
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,720
to be sitting in that account and talking

570
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,160
to your database there,

571
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,400
but then the other agents will
need to talk to that agent

572
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,540
and that's where you will need

573
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,190
to do communication between them.

574
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,360
Another use case is
shared services, right?

575
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,330
Maybe there are some shared
services, type agents,

576
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,230
that are written as a common
framework for your enterprise.

577
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,290
Those agent could be living in
a different account as well.

578
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,500
So, again, you'll need to
communicate across AWS account

579
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,030
in those cases.

580
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,050
And, but either ways
the same thing applies

581
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,710
whether it's within the same
account or cross account,

582
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,050
you still can use the Boto3 APIs

583
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,540
or you can still use
the A-2-A communication.

584
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,340
So, you don't have to worry about that

585
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,335
and feel free to deploy
it wherever you need to,

586
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,083
based on your use case.

587
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,910
The next is an MCP server.

588
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,610
So, typically, agents will require tools.

589
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,400
Tools are going to be
written as an MCP server.

590
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,660
Now, how do you communicate

591
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,600
to an MCP server using
the MCP protocol, right?

592
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,203
So, that is available,
out of the box, as well.

593
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:18,704
With AgentCode.

594
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,070
So, those were the patterns to
communicate with each other.

595
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,053
Now what about security?

596
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,190
I'll say, like, if you
ask your security team,

597
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,267
the first thing they'll say is,

598
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:37,200
"How do you control the
access to the agents?"

599
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,210
So, that's the thing, right?

600
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,280
The authentication, the authorization,

601
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,360
the fine grain control, all that is needed

602
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,553
for multi-agent orchestration.

603
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,610
So, what are the options
thus that we have here?

604
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,570
So, basically we have two
choice, again, here to make

605
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,758
between the two IAM authentication

606
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:02,200
and OAuth.

607
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,220
OAuth, you need an OAuth provider

608
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,790
which can do the OAuth
token generation for you.

609
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,540
IAM is the native AWS
authentication that you can use.

610
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,340
Both of those options are available

611
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,720
and, again, you can mix and match.

612
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,230
You don't have to choose
one over the other.

613
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,610
You can decide to,

614
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,830
some agents can use IAM authentication

615
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,653
while others can use OAuth.

616
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,650
For an MCP server, again, here
the standard MCP uses OAuth,

617
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,111
but we have modified that within AgentCore

618
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:37,710
to use IAM as well.

619
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,590
So, if you deploy an MCP server

620
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,830
within AWS AI AgentCore Runtime,

621
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,476
then you can use just IAM
authentication as well.

622
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:50,550
So, then you can do
native IAM authentication

623
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,703
across the board, if that's
your preferred choice.

624
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,450
With OAuth you, typically,
require an OAuth provider,

625
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,083
either Cognito, Okta or
any other OAuth provider.

626
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,840
If you are not familiar with it.

627
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,010
What the process is,

628
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,230
is basically your OAuth provider

629
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,140
is set up for a certain agent.

630
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,970
It can generate token.

631
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,810
That token comes when you call the agent.

632
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,490
You'll pass that token along with it.

633
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,900
Now, here's the beauty of it.

634
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,090
What AgentCore does is it's going

635
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,270
to intercept every single request.

636
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,920
It was going to inspect it.

637
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,880
It's going to see whether the
OAuth token is present or not.

638
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,410
Once the OAuth token is present,

639
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,310
it's going to go to the OAuth
provider, validated the token,

640
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,880
and only then the first line
of your code gets caught.

641
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,100
So, that's where the security comes in.

642
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,860
That's relieving you of the security job.

643
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,340
We are guarantee you that
we will be intercepting

644
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,620
the code, will be taking
care of the authentication

645
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,770
and only valid requests
are coming through.

646
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,073
So, that is very important
thing to note here.

647
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,500
There are two cases of OAuth tokens.

648
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,050
One is a user generated OAuth

649
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,600
and another is machine
to machine OAuth tokens.

650
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,920
So, there are two types of tokens

651
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,870
that you could use potentially.

652
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,340
When do you use which one?

653
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,760
So, as we see, first the
user is calling the app,

654
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,170
the app is calling this,

655
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,890
though that, you will use
the user generated token.

656
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,470
So, the user's identity is getting passed,

657
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,710
the token generated by
the user will get passed,

658
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,700
you'll use that.

659
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,760
But then maybe between
the two agent to agents

660
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,490
or between an agent to an MCP,

661
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,560
those are machine to machine things.

662
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,107
You may want to just use a
machine to machine token.

663
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:44,790
Again, AgentCore Identity
supports both of those options

664
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,203
and you can use any of them.

665
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,960
Another thing, sometimes you need

666
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,980
is the user's identity needs
to get propagated further

667
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,540
to the MCP server, right?

668
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,850
You have an MCP server, which is a tool,

669
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,770
let's say it's accessing database.

670
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,640
You want to limit the access
based on who the user was

671
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,360
and in that case you will you,
pass on the user's identity

672
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,870
onto the MCP server
and make that decision.

673
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,640
If that is not the case, then use

674
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,340
the machine-to-machine token,
makes your life simpler.

675
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,470
Sometimes you do need fine
grained even further down.

676
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,840
So for example, you may have an agent

677
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,000
that is doing multiple task

678
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,850
and then you need to
have fine grained control

679
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,350
and that is something you may need

680
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,157
to implement using code
within your AgentCode.

681
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,590
And how do you do that?

682
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,700
So, what we do is the
identity that is passed on,

683
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,610
we allow you with easy methods to extract

684
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,840
that identity token from the
request, from the context.

685
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,030
So, you can get the user's identity.

686
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,200
Now you can inspect it

687
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,330
and you can see, oh, is this user allowed

688
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,550
to do operation A and B?

689
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,860
Then keep doing both the operation.

690
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,930
If it's only allowed to do operation A

691
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,790
then just allow him to do operation A,

692
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,483
and that is something that
you built in with your code.

693
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,280
Next, we decide, like, how
do we decide between IAM

694
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,250
or OAuth, when to use which?

695
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,290
Again, the decision is simple.

696
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,960
If you want to stay in AWS ecosystem,

697
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,480
if you're using just AWS across the board,

698
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,380
you can keep using IAM and
makes your life simpler.

699
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,900
Also, when you're
starting up a new project,

700
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,020
it's much simpler to just use IAM

701
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,130
unless you have already used
OAuth in other places, right?

702
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,520
So, then it becomes simpler, setup wise,

703
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,413
getting up and running very quickly.

704
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,930
Now, on the other hand, OAuth,
if you're already familiar

705
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,910
with OAuth, if your organization

706
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,270
has an OAuth provider already set up

707
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,870
or if you want to call
across cloud, right?

708
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,800
Like if you want to do have
the cross-cloud compliant,

709
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,530
if you want to use open
source standards only,

710
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,273
then OAuth is the way to go.

711
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,630
Little bit more setup at the beginning,

712
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,460
but then it's standard it,

713
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
you can use it across the board as well.

714
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,860
The next we go is when we
set about multi account.

715
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,020
If you are using IAM, then you may need

716
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,490
to use cross account roles.

717
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,780
That's the only difference.

718
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,543
But other than that, it
still says, stays the same.

719
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,170
Finally, we'll talk about the gateway.

720
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,760
So, if you remember Sandeep
spoke about AgentCore Gateway.

721
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,730
This is where if you have enterprise APIs,

722
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,860
so a lot of enterprise APIs,

723
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
what you don't realize is
you start writing MCP servers

724
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,880
and wrapping around it.

725
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,200
You don't need to do that.

726
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,870
You can just use AgentCore
Gateway to do it.

727
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,400
But as soon as you introduce this,

728
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,290
how do we do security around it?

729
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,490
How do we do authentication

730
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,460
and authorization for
AgentCore Gateway, right?

731
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,000
So, AgentCore Gateway supports
OAuth as your mechanism.

732
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,090
It exposes everything as
an MCP server by itself.

733
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,120
So, it will allow you to do OAuth.

734
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,420
So, now an agent needs to call an API

735
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,310
that is living in your enterprise.

736
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,740
What you do is introduce the gateway.

737
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,910
You supply an M2M token to
the gateway or M2M token

738
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,860
and that token, AgentCore
Gateway will verify, validate it

739
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,940
and only if it's valid, it'll
pass it on or call your APIs.

740
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,920
It's not going to call
your APIs otherwise.

741
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,220
So, that's, again, the
built-in security that you get.

742
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,970
Then let's say your token is valid.

743
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,950
Now, how do you call your APIs?

744
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,950
So, your enterprise may
have secure API keys

745
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,730
for calling the APIs.

746
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,062
They may be already using
OAuth to authenticate

747
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,834
with your APIs or there could be nothing.

748
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,650
Maybe it's unprotected APIs.

749
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,320
So, all of those options can be supported

750
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,790
by AgentCore Gateway.

751
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,710
So, gateway can be configured to say,

752
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,660
okay, this API is protected

753
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,800
by an API key while this other
API is protected by OAuth

754
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,573
and you can mix and match again.

755
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:14,340
The key is don't change
necessarily your API code

756
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,180
to do anything.

757
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,280
Just configure the AgentCode Gateway

758
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,890
to use your existing API,
makes your life simpler

759
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,953
across the board and then
expose it as an MCP server.

760
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,000
So, we saw how to communicate
between multiple agent,

761
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,250
then we saw how to secure them.

762
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,560
Now, let's get into multi-tenancy.

763
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,400
So, this is a real
requirement in many use cases.

764
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,790
The multi-tenancy patterns
here are very similar

765
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,700
if you were using a SaaS system.

766
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,730
So if you had an, originally,
a SaaS web based application

767
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,790
which was multi-tenant,
same patterns do apply,

768
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,380
there is not much of a change,

769
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,730
it's just how you look
at it that is different.

770
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,370
So, option one is you can
have multiple instances

771
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:03,060
of the same agent deployed,
one for each tenant.

772
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,590
Again, complete isolation,

773
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,170
you get complete boundary separation.

774
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,890
The second option is you can
have an endpoint deployed.

775
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,290
So, when you deploy an agent to AgentCore,

776
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,760
you can have multiple versions

777
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,450
and each version can have
endpoints associated with them.

778
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,210
So, you can say that
endpoint A is for client A,

779
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,550
endpoint B is for client B,

780
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,650
and you can associate it with that way.

781
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,990
Again, you have some degree of separation,

782
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,430
you call it separately,

783
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,220
but behind the scenes there
is the same agent going on.

784
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,590
Or, you can just have a single endpoint

785
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,220
and do everything in the
code within your agent.

786
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,940
So, now you just have one
instance of it running.

787
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,240
But remember even when there
is one instance of it running,

788
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,310
every time you invoke an agent,

789
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,800
it's a completely
different isolated session

790
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
that AgentCore gives you.

791
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,310
So we, so a session when user A calls

792
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,970
an agent for tenant A,

793
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,310
and a user B calls an
agent for 10B, same agent,

794
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,440
we completely isolate
that session for you.

795
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,950
So there is no need to go
with option one or two.

796
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,890
You can just have a single
endpoint and handle it.

797
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,320
If you do decide to do one or two,

798
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,490
that is also a fair game.

799
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,020
It's just additional management

800
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,310
that you will have to go through.

801
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,750
So, that's the decision point.

802
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,430
Whether I want more separation

803
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,380
with little bit additional management

804
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,080
or I can handle it within my code.

805
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,820
Another thing to remember

806
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,600
about multi-tenancy is cost attribution.

807
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,430
So, that's where the hotel logging

808
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,523
that we were saying open
telemetry that comes into play.

809
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,000
We will, you will need to log those

810
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,340
for auditing purposes and cost allocation.

811
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,520
So, make sure that if you
have a multi-tenant system,

812
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,090
you'll log enough things
around it and use hotel,

813
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,840
and then you can use that anywhere.

814
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,200
Finally, we come to observability.

815
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,810
So, observability is slightly different.

816
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,730
I mean you need the standard observability

817
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,680
that you need for any system,

818
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,860
but agentic observability
is slightly different.

819
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,310
Here, you need to trace
every single component

820
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,660
what's going through it,

821
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,910
why did the agent make this decision,

822
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,830
how did it make that decision?

823
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,410
Is it calling this system, this agent

824
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,450
and then this agent and this tool,

825
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,830
all that traceability, right?

826
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,950
You need all of that
to understand to debug

827
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,260
and finally to audit it as well.

828
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,300
That's where observability comes in.

829
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,160
So, out of the box, as we said,

830
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,590
like CloudWatch dashboards are provided,

831
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,870
you can go and do session level tracing.

832
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,640
So, if you look at one of the dashboards

833
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,740
that we provide out of the box,

834
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,030
you can click into a session,

835
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,240
you can click into every single
component, how long it took,

836
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,550
what was the request,
what was the response,

837
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,410
all of that detail is available.

838
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,280
But if you already have a third
party observability system,

839
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,550
Langfuse, LangSmith, something different,

840
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,930
feel free to use that.

841
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,450
We have the hotel logs provided to you,

842
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,150
take that, feed it to
your existing system.

843
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,890
That's a fair game as well.

844
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,643
So, both those options are
fully compatible with AgentCore.

845
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,540
Finally, a futuristic agent,

846
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,910
an agent observing all the other agents,

847
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,260
and that's where you want
to eventually get to.

848
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,140
It'll come to our final solution.

849
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,650
So, this is the solution
that Epsilon has implemented.

850
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,270
What it did is all the patterns
that we have discussed,

851
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,760
they are talked about here.

852
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,570
So, for communication,
we standardized on Okta.

853
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,280
So, we are using Okta

854
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,790
for security authentication authorization,

855
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,380
communicating between the agents.

856
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,030
We are using Boto3 here.

857
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,410
So, every agent is talking

858
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,140
with each other using Boto3 APIs.

859
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,490
We are deploying some agents in an account

860
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,980
so that they can talk to
these native databases.

861
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,570
So, let's say for example Neptune

862
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,210
or any of these other
databases that we are there,

863
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,760
which are private in a particular VPC.

864
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,890
Same with the APIs on the right hand side,

865
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,230
if you see the PeopleCloud messaging APIs,

866
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,050
so those are the enterprise
APIs that are there.

867
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,660
And those APIs are protected through

868
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,120
or accessed via the gateway.

869
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,067
We standardized as I said on Okta.

870
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:19,020
So, MCP servers, gateway, agent
to agent, everything is Okta

871
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,090
for security purposes

872
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,493
and then we access the APIs through that.

873
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,370
Yeah.

874
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,984
So, if you want to take away
few things from the deep dive

875
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:33,960
of this portion, one thing is don't build

876
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,450
a single monolith agent but split

877
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,130
it into a micro agent, doing
a small amount of work, right?

878
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,890
What I've seen is while
you may have this kind

879
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,900
of architecture on a picture,

880
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,720
they build it into a
single agent in LangGraph,

881
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,850
using a workflow or something like that.

882
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,590
No, separate it out.

883
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,840
Each can be scalable on its own.

884
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,960
The second thing is security.

885
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,690
Day one, day zero, like, you need to have

886
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,030
that built in trust but verify,

887
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,790
that should be their
principle for security.

888
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,920
The third is the multi-tenancy.

889
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,810
Build it from day one.

890
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,170
So, make sure if you need multi-tenancy,

891
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,990
it's built into it right from the get go,

892
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,093
so that you don't have to
go back and refactor it.

893
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:21,390
Now, I'm going to hand over to Prashanth,

894
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,870
who's going to show you all
the magic of the AgentCore,

895
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,943
how these agents are implemented.

896
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,993
- [Prashanth] All right.

897
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:30,826
- [Jiten] Clicker,

898
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:31,659
- Clicker.

899
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:32,492
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

900
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,080
All right, thank you Jiten.

901
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,890
To go over AgentCore
architectural patterns

902
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,400
to address marketing
automation challenges.

903
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,857
Hello everyone, I'm Prashanth Athota,

904
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:51,180
SVP of Product Engineering
at Epsilon Data Management.

905
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,950
You guys hear me okay?

906
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,000
All right, thank you.

907
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,380
So, today I kind of go over,
first of all, who we are,

908
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,620
what we do and the type
of the opportunities

909
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,040
we identified to build agents

910
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,443
within our product and ecosystem.

911
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,340
And the type of the agents
we build using AgentCore

912
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,340
and Bedrock, and a small
demo of those agents at play.

913
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,430
Probably most interesting
part of the my whole deck.

914
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,120
And the benefits and the challenges

915
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,010
we faced while building those agents,

916
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,573
lessons learned, I would say.

917
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,490
Right?

918
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,323
So...

919
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,013
All right about Epsilon.

920
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,410
Epsilon Data Management

921
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,250
or Epsilon in short is a
subsidiary of Publicis Group.

927
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,860
At Epsilon we serve many industries

928
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,640
like QuickServe, finance,
retail, automotive

929
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,510
in a, there's like CPG,
travel and advertising,

930
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,043
so many and so forth.

931
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,790
All right.

932
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,523
So, what makes Epsilon
unique in this industry?

933
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,953
Customer identity.

934
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,570
We carry over 200 million
privacy protected IDs,

935
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,740
linking address, name and at
least a single transaction.

936
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,050
95% of them are verified

937
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,333
and a 100% are data mistake.

938
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,853
And the data, we host
national consumer database,

939
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:11,493
consists over 200 million plus consumers.

940
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,013
Self-reported over a
thousand plus attributes,

941
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,723
over $3 trillion spent transactions.

942
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,600
And our best in care
solutions like digital media,

943
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,630
retail media, network, clean rooms,

944
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,213
customer data platform,
loyalty and messaging.

945
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,833
Also industry leading support services.

946
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,943
So, at Epsilon we believe
in person-first marketing.

947
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Our one view, like, using
our data and identity,

948
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,190
we provide a single comprehensive view

949
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,580
of the universe to potential buyers

950
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,503
for their marketers products.

951
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,870
And then with our one
vision we understand who

952
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,010
to engage, when to engage

953
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,700
and, you know, using their real-time,

954
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,120
like, you know, the spend

955
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,600
and then the one voice
delivering an experience

956
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,460
that relevant at personalized

957
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,613
for each individual at a point in time.

958
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,030
So these are the kind of,
you know, we look back

959
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,950
and say, "Okay, what are the improvements?

960
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,830
Where we can use our agents?"

961
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,050
So, some of the areas

962
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,010
is effective personalized messaging,

963
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,790
kind of providing the targeted
message at the right time

964
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,830
for the right individual.

965
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,607
By doing that the results are like,

966
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:49,113
you know, we get a higher
engagement for that message.

967
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,230
And then dynamic customer
journey orchestration

968
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,310
to provide user experience,

969
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,670
relevant to the user transaction,

970
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,003
which will in turn improve
the conversion rates.

971
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,513
Integrated systems for engagement,

972
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,990
so we would like to
bring the agents together

973
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,410
so we can integrate all
these products together,

974
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:21,410
so we have more, obviously,
less use resource usage

975
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,963
and more efficiently, and
operating those products.

976
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,130
And then the rapid
innovation and automation.

977
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,380
Building our GenAI platform,

978
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,400
helped us to build agents
at much faster speeds

979
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,013
and to reduce, you know,
improve the time to market.

980
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,200
All right, so driving the performance

981
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,913
across the owned channels.

982
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:53,250
Most of the brands they would like

983
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,560
to know their customers

984
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:00,420
and to create effective
segments are the audience.

985
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,450
To do that, we build the agents.

986
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,950
One is like our 360 degree customer view

987
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,550
and audience.ai.

988
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,563
Audience.ai is more like,

989
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,420
instead of understanding their databases,

990
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,370
complex relationships,
complex SQL statements,

991
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:23,020
they can literally write a plain text

992
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,663
and get their segments done,
with the plain English.

993
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,600
And then defining the
campaigns across the channels.

994
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,850
So type of the like agents we build,

995
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,140
like, a brief agent campaign,

996
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,770
brief agent, branding
agent, creation agent

997
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,750
and campaign agent.

998
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,500
And AI assisted on demand and scheduling.

999
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,020
So, they're all coming
together, like, multiple agents

1000
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,000
to build those campaigns.

1001
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,700
And then once the campaign is generated,

1002
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,920
once the campaign is executed,

1003
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,610
we have agents kind of
measuring the performance

1004
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,830
and readjusting the optimizing

1005
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,723
the strategy of those campaigns.

1006
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,320
So, whether it is campaign analytics,

1007
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,023
agents consuming the insights, et cetera.

1008
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,620
So, here is the kind of a timelines,

1009
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,953
like, our journey when
we started back in 2024.

1010
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,760
In Q2 we introduced the GenAI,

1011
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,370
which is more for the audience creation,

1012
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,340
where this platform can build audience

1013
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,600
or segments using the plain English text

1014
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,893
to SQL conversion.

1015
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,930
Then we kind of in Q3
implemented Subject Line,

1016
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,780
Image tagging on the Bedrock,

1017
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,463
you know, some of those agents.

1018
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,380
Beginning of this year we have
the first content creation,

1019
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,610
our HTML agent and then the Q3,

1020
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:58,020
we kind of introduced AI into our SDLC,

1021
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,840
which definitely improved
our productivity,

1022
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,800
getting almost like 20 plus
agents in a short time period.

1023
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,580
And creating the content
monitoring, et cetera,

1024
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,540
on our platforms.

1025
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,470
And at present we have seven
plus teams working alongside

1026
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,523
of AWS, building our agentic platform.

1027
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:23,910
And that said, I believe we're
gonna go for a small demo

1028
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,153
of all these agents coming
together, playing along.

1029
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,303
Yes.

1030
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,590
- [Announcer] Every minute
brands send tens of thousands

1031
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,440
of emails and the vast...

1032
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,483
- Sorry.

1033
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,580
- [Announcer] Every minute
brands send tens of thousands

1034
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,690
of emails and the vast
majority land in blind inboxes.

1035
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,300
With Epsilon that ends.

1036
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,960
Engage with customers on a
deeper level across all devices.

1037
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,053
Let me show you how Epsilon
agents build campaigns.

1038
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,070
Every strong brand starts
with a clear message.

1039
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,900
Inside Epsilon messaging,

1040
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,060
that message begins with a campaign brief,

1041
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,910
built on decades of Epsilon's
identity intelligence

1042
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,353
and marketing precision.

1043
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,590
A campaign doesn't start with chaos,

1044
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,180
it starts with structure.

1045
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,140
Epsilon messaging instantly
organizes intent into a clean,

1046
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,583
dependable workflow.

1047
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,060
Choosing email here
isn't selecting a format,

1048
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,250
it's activating one of
the most trusted channels

1049
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,120
in modern marketing.

1050
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,720
With a few details the
platform aligns data, context

1051
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,030
and audience signals behind the scenes.

1052
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,750
Shaping a foundation the brand
can build on confidently.

1053
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,540
The editor opens not as a blank canvas

1054
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,770
but as a guided space

1055
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,200
where the brand's voice
naturally finds clarity

1056
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,133
and direction.

1057
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,760
Templates remove the
burden of design guessing.

1058
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,710
Branding is applied with precision.

1059
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,800
So, every message aligns
with the brand's identity,

1060
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,400
instantly recognizable, always consistent.

1061
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,870
Once the template is in place,

1062
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,210
the brand stands on solid ground,

1063
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,090
the styling is locked, the look is unified

1064
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,570
and the message can now
focus purely on meaning.

1065
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,790
A generic campaign fades fast,

1066
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:20,460
but when Epsilon's AI
agents shape the audience,

1067
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,760
timing and message, your
campaign hits with precision

1068
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,383
and drives real action.

1069
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,100
When the message fits the moment,

1070
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,223
the channel becomes effortless
with Epsilon messaging.

1071
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,370
Edits that once required, long back

1072
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,590
and forth cycles become frictionless.

1073
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:41,400
Phrasing flow and rhythm,
adjust with a level of precision

1074
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,850
that keeps the message sharp.

1075
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,890
Suggestions add another
layer, subtle, thoughtful,

1076
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,170
grounded in brand tone and clarity.

1077
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,753
The small refinements that
elevate communication.

1078
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,620
Personalization becomes identity driven.

1079
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,160
No long segmentation
work, no manual filtering.

1080
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,630
Relevance at scale,

1081
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,243
supported by the industry's
most trusted data.

1082
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,020
Dynamic elements bring
the message to life.

1083
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,330
Effortlessly adding motion, interaction

1084
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,153
and depth without additional
creative complexity.

1085
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,300
Tone controls bring discipline,
professional when needed,

1086
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,100
optimistic when desired,

1087
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,550
a brand's voice clearly expressed
the way it was intended.

1088
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:27,390
Readability and visual
refinements enhance comprehension.

1089
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,200
Clean spacing, balance, design
and structured hierarchy.

1090
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,753
Guide the reader through
the message effortlessly.

1091
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:40,200
With one click, the message
sharpens into its final form.

1092
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,540
Campaigns miss when they lack relevance.

1093
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,450
Epsilon's AI agents
build relevance at scale

1094
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,543
so your message lands and
your customer responds.

1095
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,140
A full review confirms
the message is aligned,

1096
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,000
structured and ready.

1097
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,770
Device previews show consistency

1098
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,720
across screens and environments.

1099
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,120
Timing decisions, shape performance.

1100
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,160
Epsilon messaging aligns delivery

1101
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,860
with patterns proven through
identity intelligence

1102
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,813
and decades of engagement data.

1103
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,230
And with that the message moves

1104
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,450
from creation to execution.

1105
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,060
Built with precision using AI agents,

1106
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,890
strengthened by identity,

1107
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,050
delivered through Epsilon messaging.

1108
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,170
The platform, the world's
strongest brand's trust

1109
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,563
to communicate with
clarity, scale, and purpose.

1110
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,723
- Okay, all right.

1111
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,810
So, now, I'm gonna go over like the type

1112
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,030
of the benefits we observed

1113
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,333
by building all these agents
across our product suite.

1114
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,173
Agent prototyping.

1115
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,780
By using the AgentCore,
definitely we see like reduced

1116
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,050
the prototyping time, number of,

1117
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,383
you know, days it took,
from weeks to days actually.

1118
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,770
And then campaign set up time it's,

1119
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,990
we observed 30% improvements.

1120
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,450
But, again, as the adoption goes up

1121
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,020
across campaign managers and analysts,

1122
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,820
I'm sure that we are gonna see more.

1123
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:20,430
Personalization capacity increased by 20%.

1124
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,290
Campaign creation times.

1125
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,230
Obviously we saved many number of hours,

1126
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,810
but, again, this is all we just starting

1127
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,800
with multiple agents.

1128
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,880
As we build more and more
agents across other areas,

1129
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,700
we're definitely going to
see a lot more improvements

1130
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,533
or savings I guess.

1131
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,253
So, the lessons learned,

1132
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,470
you know, it's kind of,
we used to spend a lot

1133
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,920
of time, manually, creating workflows

1134
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,290
versus switch our focus
now more, like, automation

1135
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,053
and outcome-based journeys.

1136
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:04,460
And we also have the teams
changing their mindset,

1137
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,930
what to think about more of outcome

1138
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,973
than what to do and how to do things.

1139
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,730
So, even in any use cases,
like, instead of worrying

1140
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,460
about what models out there

1141
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,800
or what they're coming up with,

1142
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,150
where you should more focus
on, like, what are the type

1143
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,310
of problems we're trying to solve

1144
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,740
or the outcomes we are looking for.

1145
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,990
And then look for the
models that more suited

1146
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,413
for your needs rather than
going after model by model.

1147
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:38,520
And rapid prototyping.

1148
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,237
Definitely, you know, using
some platforms like AgentCore,

1149
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,550
using like their plug-and-play
abstraction layer,

1150
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,560
planner compliance and recommendations,

1151
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,290
it'll help you to build, experiment

1152
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,123
and deploy the agents at speed.

1153
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,890
And using something like Amazon Queue,

1154
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,410
integrating with your SDLC.

1155
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,810
Improved us, like, you
know, especially AI-DLC

1156
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,810
and also AI pipelines, integrating them,

1157
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,930
definitely helped us to
speed up our iterations

1158
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,433
and fail fast.

1159
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,943
And then what's next?

1160
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,970
Autonomous everywhere.

1161
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,610
We would like to expand our agents,

1162
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:29,640
use of agents from marketing over

1163
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,660
to other areas like auto,
data and other platforms.

1164
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,373
Loyalty and other areas.

1165
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:41,373
And building self-healing,
self-monitoring type of agents.

1166
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,300
Also integrating the AI-DLC
pipelines with the operations

1167
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,370
so we can have autonomous agents,

1168
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,790
working for maintaining the
platform, and stability,

1169
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,033
and secure, safe security
and compliance, et cetera.

1170
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,630
And a unified intelligence layer

1171
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,390
by using the agent gateway,

1172
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,580
bringing all the products together.

1173
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,070
So we have MCPs and the
tools are all coming,

1174
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,900
working together and the data

1175
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,480
is shared across the products
using the same agents,

1176
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,893
exposed to same agents.

1177
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,700
And commercializing and acceleration.

1178
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,000
We'd like to take these
architectural patterns

1179
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,450
and ex, you know, and also build agents

1180
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,700
that can be used by our clients

1181
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,290
or let the clients build
their agents using our data,

1182
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,653
using our APIs and et cetera.

1183
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:39,400
And also publish some of these agents

1184
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:44,010
in the marketplace.

1185
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:47,943
So, you know, we can kind
of monetize based on those.

1186
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,033
All right, that said.

1187
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,733
Sandeep, you know, complete.

1188
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,480
- All right, am I still audible?

1189
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,350
You like me?

1190
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,183
Yes?

1191
00:57:02,183 --> 00:57:03,016
Good.

1192
00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:06,120
All right, so here are some of the res,

1193
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,890
learning resources that, I think,

1194
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,660
will be really helpful for you.

1195
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,870
These are some of the things
that I refer to every day.

1196
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:16,440
There are great examples in
sample code on GitHub as well.

1197
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,460
And there are free learning
courses on Skill Builder,

1198
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,293
AWS Skill Builder.

1199
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:22,980
So, please take advantage of these

1200
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,710
and have as much as hands-on
practice as possible

1201
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,590
so that you can build
those great AI agents

1202
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,950
and deploy on top of
Bedrock AgentCore services.

1203
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,310
And if you love us, you can
clap at the end of the session,

1204
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,760
but first remember that you
have to fill the survey,

1205
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,500
especially look at my face, I'm very,

1206
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,720
you know, innocent, I'm a nice person.

1207
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,290
Please do fill the session
survey and give us good ratings.

1208
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,123
Okay?

1209
00:57:47,123 --> 00:57:48,180
Thank you so much guys.

1210
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,013
Take care.

1211
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:51,545
(crowd clapping)
