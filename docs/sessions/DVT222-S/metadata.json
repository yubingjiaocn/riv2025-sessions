  "abstract": "Engineering team are stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to observability: either collect all the data on how your system is behaving or risk not having that one thing needed during an incident. Grepr acts as a proxy between your observability agents and your observability vendor and uses real-time ML to understand the behavior of every piece of data. Grepr's Intelligent Data Engine automatically reduces noise, while keeping all the original raw data in low-cost storage, automatically handling new usage patterns or spikes. The result: minimal configuration, immediate 90% reduction in costs, with no migrations needed. Learn how Grepr works and see it in action in this session. This presentation is brought to you by Grepr, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "工程团队在可观测性方面面临两难境地：要么收集系统行为的所有数据，要么冒着在事故期间缺少关键信息的风险。Grepr 作为可观测性代理和可观测性供应商之间的代理，使用实时机器学习来理解每个数据片段的行为。Grepr 的智能数据引擎自动减少噪音，同时将所有原始数据保存在低成本存储中，自动处理新的使用模式或峰值。结果是：最少的配置，立即减少 90% 的成本，无需迁移。了解 Grepr 的工作原理并在此会话中看到它的实际应用。本演示由 AWS 合作伙伴 Grepr 为您呈现。",
