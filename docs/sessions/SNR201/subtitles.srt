1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,724
- [Ishit] Good morning.

2
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:03,060
- [Audience] Good morning.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,609
- Well that's great. I love this crowd.

4
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:05,610
(audience chuckles)

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,520
Well, welcome to re:Invent and Las Vegas.

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,370
I'm excited to be here with you today.

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,920
This is my 13th re:Invent.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,400
I attended first six like
many of you in this room

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,290
as a customer of AWS,

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,473
and this is my seventh one
as a builder here at AWS.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,450
Now in my role at AWS, I wear dual hat.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,850
I get to lead and build

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,850
and solve business problem
using technology and AI.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,370
And I also get to work
with C-Suite and executives

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,580
of some of our largest
customers like yourselves.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,220
How many of you in the room
are first time at re:Invent,

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,870
show of hand?

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,940
Well, wow, many. Welcome.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,043
Any veterans here? Five plus years?

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,283
Excellent.

21
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,020
Well, I hope you have a
fantastic week because it's an

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,190
amazing time to be a senior
leader in the organization.

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,700
What a privilege that we
all have to become the agent

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,580
of change and lead our organizations

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,000
beyond just automation to high agency.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,580
So in this session over
next 40 minutes or so,

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,570
I'm going to talk about
what do leaders need to do

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,630
to lead in this new era of high agency?

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,430
What are the mental model shifts

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,950
that we require as leadership team?

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,860
How do we re-envision
our business processes

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,200
and then go slightly deeper
into some of the technical

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,683
and architectural capability

34
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:30,240
that help bring this vision to life.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
So let's dive in.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,340
Now, I'm sure many of you
have seen lot of things being

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,710
labeled as agents,

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,870
but when you peel back that wrapper,

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,160
underneath that you find
many of these things.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,330
You have just good old scripted automation

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,360
that takes repetitive predictable task

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,363
and in a fixed set of workflows, codes it.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,210
As you move up that autonomy chain,

44
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,890
you have generative AI assistance

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,400
and the chat bots that
provide useful information,

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,354
has access to data,
can respond to queries,

47
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:09,780
can actually summarize the
document and information

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,400
and has an ability to respond,

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,623
but very limited ability to act.

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
As you move up that autonomy chain,

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,410
we start to see higher order business task

52
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,260
and the goal that these agents can do.

53
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,230
The goal and task-based
agents are optimized

54
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,583
for completing a specific
task by working with humans.

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,690
This is where we start
to see lot higher value.

56
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,620
And then at pretty high up is
the highest level of autonomy

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,150
of agentic system where
multiple agents work together,

58
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,130
take a much higher order complex

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,260
and sometimes ambiguous task

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,820
and are able to break that down
into steps and pursue that.

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,950
So this is a good mental model

62
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,630
to think about when your teams come

63
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,860
and talk to you about
automation or AI agents.

64
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,620
Now this is not to say that
one is better than the other.

65
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,043
As senior leaders, it is
important that we understand

66
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:07,747
what tool to apply to solve which problem.

67
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:11,520
So the question that I really
find useful when I'm talking

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,670
to my team is to what are the behaviors

69
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,470
or attributes that makes
something an agentic system?

70
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,975
So let's talk about what
are some of those behaviors.

71
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,620
Agentic systems are goal driven.

72
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,410
As I talked about, they
take a higher order goal

73
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,940
or an intent and have an
ability to break that into

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,450
multiple chunk- chunks of
tasks to go and complete.

75
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,610
They are resourceful, they have an ability

76
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,390
to access the tools, the data,
the context, the hierarchy

77
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,220
and the roles inside of your organization

78
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,393
to take those action.

79
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,570
They remember, they have a memory,

80
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,842
so that you don't start again

81
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:52,620
when you have a new transaction.

82
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,210
They remember that there was an issue

83
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,480
with the billing last time
I tried to do something.

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,130
They learn and adapt.

85
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,590
They get better with the feedback

86
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,260
and they use escalation not just

87
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,570
as a mechanism when something is wrong,

88
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,940
but as an inbuilt trust mechanism

89
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,980
to involve human in the loop.

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,160
So it's good to keep this framing in mind

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,233
when you think about agentic system.

92
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,430
Now you might ask, but
we've been on this journey

93
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,190
for a couple of years now, so why now?

94
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,453
What has changed?

95
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,330
And there are two fundamental shifts

96
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,640
that are happening very, very rapidly

97
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,193
that we as senior leaders
need to pay attention to.

98
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,230
The first thing that is happening
is that the unit of task

99
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,730
or the length of task
that AI can do is doubling

100
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,610
roughly every seven months or so.

101
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,880
So you now can take a
lot more complex tasks

102
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,720
and give agents to go and
accomplish those tasks.

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,980
Now as senior leaders, we know
that just having a technology

104
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,430
or tool that is very
intelligent and highly capable

105
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,370
but is extremely
expensive and unaffordable

106
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,590
is not very useful, is it?

107
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,990
So what is also happening on the other end

108
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,990
is that the unit price
or the cost to access

109
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,843
this intelligence is
continuously dropping as well.

110
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,440
MMLU is a standard benchmark,

111
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,538
massive multi-language understand-

112
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:21,630
massive multi-language task understanding

113
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,440
and that is used to
benchmark language models.

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,760
And just to give you the context,

115
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,563
an MMLU of 43 is similar to
a struggling high schooler.

116
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,770
They mostly are guessing answers,

117
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,780
but they're very confident.

118
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,180
I have one at home so I
know how that feels like,

119
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,580
I'm sure many of you do too.

120
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,840
But MMLU of 83 is like a PhD level expert.

121
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,490
They understand the nuance,

122
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,010
they are able to deal with ambiguity.

123
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,700
And so we can see that
MMLU and the unit price

124
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,100
to access both of this is dropping.

125
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,090
So we are in this sweet where
the capability are increasing

126
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,300
and the unit price and
the cost is dropping.

127
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,370
And this is why we are starting

128
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,870
to see real world applications of agents.

129
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,670
Druva is a data security company

130
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,580
I'm sure many of you
in this room use them.

131
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,890
Now when you're dealing with
a cybersecurity incident,

132
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,740
a ransomware attack, you
don't have time to go

133
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,890
through like thousands of pieces of logs

134
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,080
and information manually
to sift through that

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
when you're in middle of the crisis.

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,140
And so Druva worked with
AWS to build Dru AI.

137
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,320
These are agents that don't just respond,

138
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,150
but they take action.

139
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,520
They look at proactively the logs

140
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,250
and autonomously detect the system issues

141
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,560
and then they take corrective action,

142
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,350
they move the data around,
they update the policies,

143
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,080
they move the data through
a storage that is lot more

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,300
cost effective based on
the data retention in the

145
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,653
policies that you set,
driving lot higher value.

146
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,706
But to take advantage of this requires

147
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:02,193
a change in how we lead.

148
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,190
If you think about historically,

149
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,110
leadership has been mainly about
optimizing for determinism.

150
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,090
We are all rewarded for lowering

151
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,150
and reducing deviation, having repeatable,

152
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,573
predictable processes that
do the same thing over

153
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,610
and over again by reducing the error rate.

154
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,100
And now this works today.

155
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,240
But the non-determinism,
the ability to improvise,

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,740
the ability to adapt, the
ability to take different action

157
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,530
based on the context
and changing requirement

158
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,263
with agent is a feature, not a bug.

159
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,650
Now I'm sure this might
make some of us nervous,

160
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,720
especially from regulated industries.

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,110
So this is not about just
stepping into the wild west.

162
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,560
This is about us as leaders being aware

163
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,800
that the non-determinism is
what gives agents the power

164
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,350
and how do we safely harness this

165
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,200
by setting up the right guardrails.

166
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,310
And the mental model that I
find useful is to think about

167
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,403
how we work with some of
our high agency teammates.

168
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,270
You don't call your high
agency teammate every Monday

169
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,450
and say, hey, I'm going
to sit down with you

170
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,820
to give you specific
tasks that you are going

171
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,760
to execute every single day
and then you're going to come

172
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,640
and at the end of the day,
report to me what you did.

173
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,400
Right? We actually give them a strategic

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,520
higher order intent, we
give them the boundaries

175
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,050
within which they can operate,

176
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,240
we empower them with the right resources

177
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,730
and access that they
need to get the job done,

178
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,280
and then we trust them to escalate to us

179
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,053
and involve us as needed.

180
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,070
And so to lead in this
high agency requires

181
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,710
a shift in the leadership model

182
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,923
because we are no longer
managing automation,

183
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,760
we are managing thousands
of agents at scale.

184
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,810
And that intelligent autonomy

185
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,100
and managing that at scale
requires shift into four key

186
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,663
areas of leadership.

187
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,170
Now, please keep in mind
that the mental model

188
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,020
that I'm going to share
are just mental models.

189
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,230
They are not recipes or
strict operating model.

190
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,660
So take them with that lens

191
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,970
and four areas that I'm
going to cover starting

192
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,950
with governance.

193
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,040
Now traditionally,
whether it is in software

194
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,910
or in compliance, we have
gate based governance

195
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,560
system moves, comes to a
complete stop, waits for someone

196
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,980
to verify a series of
things via a checklist

197
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,270
that has been defined

198
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,060
and maybe audited a
couple of times a year.

199
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,880
They approve it, then
the system moves again,

200
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,683
stops again at the next toll gate.

201
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,970
Now this works today, but
when you have hundreds

202
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,110
and thousands of agents,

203
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,810
you can't put these toll booths in front

204
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,950
of them consistently.

205
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,173
That will just slow it down.

206
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,550
Instead, the mental model that is useful

207
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,060
is to think about providing
that strategic intent

208
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,250
and then having a policy engine

209
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,040
that can govern this at scale.

210
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,300
And as I was thinking about,
well, what governs like this?

211
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,660
The, the thing that came to
my mind is that if you look at

212
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,960
how board of directors
actually work with the CEO.

213
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,120
Once again, they don't go to CEO

214
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,520
and say, I'm going to tell you exactly how

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,710
to run your company every single day.

216
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,586
Board and CEO typically align on

217
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:30,120
a strategic direction and the vision,

218
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,870
periodically they go
and audit and calibrate.

219
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,290
But there is also
specific guardrails around

220
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,360
what requires board approval

221
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,560
and the management team knows
when to engage the board.

222
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
So it's a useful mental model

223
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,703
to think about governance this way.

224
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,663
The second shift is in risk.

225
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,490
Now today, our risk management
controls are pretty much

226
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,380
like a factory floor.

227
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,710
On a factory floor you have
fixed threshold, right?

228
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,720
Even today in many of our organizations,

229
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,520
we have fixed threshold regardless

230
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,350
of the exposure of the risk.

231
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,680
So if a purchase order
is more than $2 million,

232
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,830
it requires approval of a vice president.

233
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,820
If it is beyond $10 million,
it must go to the CFO.

234
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,410
Now these controls for risk
break down when you're dealing

235
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,110
with autonomy at scale.

236
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,800
The mental model that I find
useful is to think about

237
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,083
managing the risk like a trading floor.

238
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,630
And on our trading floor,

239
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,710
the risk is actually managed
lot more aggressively,

240
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,800
but it is managed through real
time visibility and control.

241
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,720
Traders have a portfolio that
they can play the trades in.

242
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,810
Not every move is managed,
but if the portfolio

243
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,510
or a particular transaction
violates the policy,

244
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,930
then there are circuit breakers
that stops the trading.

245
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,210
Let's say the portfolio drops by 20%,

246
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,150
the circuit breaker kicks
in and stops the trading.

247
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,420
And so we need to think
about agents this way

248
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,750
where agents have to earn their liquidity

249
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,030
by operating within the risk controls

250
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,550
and the boundaries that we design

251
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,510
and have it with real time
visibility and automation.

252
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,960
And it's also not about
managing every single agentic

253
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,740
transaction, but also
monitoring the systematic drift

254
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,300
in a multi-agent system.

255
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,423
When that happens, you want the
circuit breakers to kick in.

256
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,890
One of the most fundamental
change though is going

257
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,770
to be in the organization structure.

258
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,780
And again, as leaders, we all know this.

259
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,840
Every single time there has been a major

260
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,890
technological change, that
has required us to reimagine

261
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,185
and rethink how we organize.

262
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:50,190
Before cloud, we had application
and development teams

263
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,700
and then infrastructure and
technology operation team.

264
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,420
When cloud came, these
boundaries got blurred.

265
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,120
You started to get full
stack engineering teams

266
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,000
that can operate at all
layers of the stack.

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,900
In fact, with agents, we
are seeing this inside

268
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,800
of our own teams where boundaries
beyond just engineering,

269
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,610
including the business process
roles, product management,

270
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,180
engineering, TPMs are all getting blurred

271
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,730
because you have an ability to execute

272
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,183
and work with agents throughout
the entire value chain.

273
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,270
Historically, our org structures
are vertically optimized.

274
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,020
Now this structure provides a stability,

275
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,510
but it is not designed to move fast.

276
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,390
If a customer has an
issue that gets handed off

277
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,800
sequentially between the
department from customer support

278
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,800
to supply chain to distribution
to return and refund

279
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,193
and it slows it down.

280
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,990
But the mental model to use in
terms of how do you organize

281
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,333
for agents is like an immune system.

282
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,380
How does our body's immune system work?

283
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,320
If there is a threat or
if there is a problem

284
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,970
our white blood cells don't wait

285
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,280
for a memo from the brain, right?

286
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,440
They don't call a meeting with the lungs,

287
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,690
they actually swarm that problem

288
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,300
and then figure out how to solve that.

289
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,940
So the cross-functional
teams that are organized

290
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,850
around a business workflow, regardless

291
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,010
of the current departmental structure

292
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,340
is how you really get outcome from agents.

293
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,930
The other thing that happens in this kind

294
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,580
of art structure is that
system learns constantly.

295
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,070
So it's sort of like
creating antibodies, right?

296
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,380
So when you have this responsive swarm,

297
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,963
it gets better with period of time.

298
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,483
The last piece,

299
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,020
and so before, before I go
there, really what we need

300
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,680
to think about is that
agents should not be limited

301
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,090
by your org chart.

302
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,320
They should be limited by the

303
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,900
objective that they're pursuing.

304
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,600
That brings us to the last part

305
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,046
of this leadership mental model
and that is around culture.

306
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:03,030
Historically, we have all optimized the

307
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,950
culture for precision.

308
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,570
It's sort of like, well,

309
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,690
you gotta almost hit a
bullseye every single time.

310
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,053
That's what we reward,
a perfect execution.

311
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,240
But what happens in a
research lab like culture,

312
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,300
that culture is open to new discovery,

313
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,820
sometimes good, sometimes bad.

314
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,950
But if those mistakes happen,

315
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,090
they are used as a learning mechanism.

316
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,450
They're documented,
they are shared widely,

317
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,720
and the new discovery and
adaptation is once again

318
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,720
a feature, not a bug in
this kind of a culture.

319
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,150
And so that's the shift that we need

320
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,660
because what we are trying
to scale is not obedience.

321
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,690
We are actually trying
to scale the intelligence

322
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,403
throughout our organization.

323
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,390
And so the four key
leadership mental model shifts

324
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,070
that I talked about, governance
like board of directors,

325
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,410
that provides strategic direction,

326
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,897
the continuous calibration
and the guardrail

327
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,840
risk management like a trading floor

328
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,200
where you have real time
visibility and circuit breakers.

329
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,450
And then agents earn their liquidity

330
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,330
and authority to operate
by consistently showing us

331
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,030
that they're operating
within those risk controls.

332
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,300
The organization structure
that is like an immune system

333
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,940
that is a lot more fluid and responsive.

334
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,860
And then finally, the culture

335
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,890
that is like a research
lab culture that is open

336
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,660
to new discoveries.

337
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,390
If you wanna read more,
you can scan that QR code

338
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,573
and dive deeper into some
of these mental models.

339
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,440
Now I wanna talk about
the business process

340
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,660
and I'm going to pick a business process

341
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,760
that I'm pretty sure
most of us in this room

342
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,673
are familiar with, which
is accounts payable.

343
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,510
Now traditionally the goal
of an accounts payable

344
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,180
business process has been to pay invoices

345
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,378
on time and accurately.

346
00:16:56,378 --> 00:17:00,840
And I want all of us to time
travel to pre-ERP days, right?

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,400
So just stay with me here.

348
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,460
In the pre-ERP days,
what happened was that

349
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,770
an account payable system
had a fixed goal to pay

350
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,310
every invoice on time and accurately,

351
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,530
but the workflows were vertical.

352
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,080
So procurement will process the PO,

353
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,468
receiving will confirm
the receipt of the goods,

354
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,880
treasury will make the payment,

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,400
and AP will post the invoice and so on.

356
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,300
The SOPs were all
vertically inside of each

357
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,100
of the department and the function

358
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,584
and then there was sequential
handoff that happened.

359
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,630
Now in this kind of a system,
if there was any error

360
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,080
or an issue, it'll manually
get kicked back into

361
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,430
the previous process.

362
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,123
Somebody will have to call the
department to fix that issue.

363
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,300
How many of you in the room have been part

364
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,160
of an ERP implementation or run an ERP?

365
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,200
Okay, several of you.

366
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,540
Now, what happened during ERP is

367
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,540
that we could not look at
these vertical processes.

368
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,620
We had to re-engineer an
AP process horizontally.

369
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,000
We had to connect the dots
between procurement, receiving,

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,953
treasury, AP and so on.

371
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,500
That- that forced us to talk
across department and function

372
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,770
to relay out our business process.

373
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,090
But that- there was still limitation

374
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,160
because the goal was
still fixed, which was

375
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,200
to pay the invoices on
time and accurately.

376
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,800
And if there was an issue,
anytime during the process

377
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,980
it'll get kicked back and
then manually you'll have to

378
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,543
handle the exception.

379
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,950
Now, what if in an agentic
system that I described earlier,

380
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,110
we take a lot higher magnitude goal.

381
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,860
What if the goal of AP is not
just to pay invoice on time

382
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,740
but to optimize our cash flow?

383
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,940
And the system has the
freedom to operate fluidly

384
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,220
within the boundaries that we set.

385
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,670
So a particular invoice will
go through all of the steps,

386
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,920
but then a second invoice comes in

387
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,980
and the agents will know
that this invoice is in Euro

388
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,470
and I have a 60 day payment
term on this particular invoice.

389
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,560
That means I'm going to
call a Forex trading agent

390
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,890
and say, can I invest this for 59 days

391
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,320
and actually improve my cash flow?

392
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,800
Or a third invoice comes
in and it recognizes

393
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,920
that last four times I
approved this particular

394
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,552
vendor payment, it had to go into dispute

395
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:30,990
because we did not like the quality

396
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,420
of the deliverable that the vendor had.

397
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,120
And so this time, I'm going to proactively

398
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,920
bring human in the loop and say,

399
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,260
even though approval
processes have confirmed,

400
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm going to enroll the human and say,

401
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,100
hey, last four times we didn't
like what happened here.

402
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,870
Do you still want me to pay?

403
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,840
And so that's a lot higher order task,

404
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,200
but also a lot more fluid workflows

405
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,970
that are happening here.

406
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,410
Today, though as I was talking about,

407
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,240
we are already seeing
goal-based agents being in play.

408
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,860
This is where you have a planning agent

409
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,010
or a planner that takes
this higher order task,

410
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,380
breaks it into manageable chunk,

411
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,890
and then you have orchestrator
that works across individual

412
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,620
agents inside of each of the
function like procurement,

413
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,882
receiving, AP, treasury and
goods to get to the payment

414
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:21,240
and reduce the cycle time.

415
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,690
In fact, we are seeing
this in Amazon as well.

416
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,650
I'll give you an example of
an orchestrator within Amazon.

417
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,570
In our warehouses, we
have over a million robots

418
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,058
that actually help us safely

419
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:37,743
and quickly move the packages around.

420
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,570
And we have this orchestrator
called deep fleet

421
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,770
sort of think about this as
a brain of this robotic fleet

422
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,670
that manages these 1
million robots distributed

423
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,490
all over the world, across our warehouses.

424
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,669
And by constantly optimizing that,

425
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:00,149
we are able to reduce
the travel time by 10%.

426
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:02,400
Now, 10% may not sound a lot,

427
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,100
but at our scale with million robots

428
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,740
and multiple hundreds,
hundreds of warehouses

429
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,170
and distribution center,
that means that we are able

430
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,510
to get the packages faster to you.

431
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,751
And so that's an example

432
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:17,130
of an orchestrator operating at scale,

433
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,730
optimizing the business outcome.

434
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,830
Now, earlier I talked about the behaviors

435
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,600
of an agentic system.

436
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
Let's double click.

437
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,450
We talked about the behaviors,

438
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,940
we talked about the
leadership mental model,

439
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,430
as well as the business process changes.

440
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,660
Let's double click and say

441
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,510
what are the technical capabilities

442
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,881
that bring these behaviors to life?

443
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,600
And there are three
things that agents need.

444
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
And again, if you wanna
geek out a little bit more

445
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,782
in architectural implication,
you can scan this QR code

446
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:50,670
and read an article
that dives a lot deeper

447
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,880
into the architectural
implication in your environment.

448
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,890
But really, agents need three things.

449
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,250
They need intelligence, they need context,

450
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,870
and they need trust.

451
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,460
And, and if we were to think
of agent as sort of human body,

452
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,850
here is how that looks like.

453
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,070
The intelligence is sort of like the brain

454
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,080
of the agentic system.

455
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,870
And your models including
your thinking models

456
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,330
for chain of thought,
reasoning, reflection,

457
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,350
they provide the brain an
ability to take the intent

458
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,510
and break it into task.

459
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,600
But just having a brain is
sort of like having a brain

460
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,590
in a jar, right?

461
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,570
It cannot take any action.

462
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,350
So you then have the access, the context,

463
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,220
which provides agent and ability
to access the right data.

464
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,220
It provides an ability
to actually take action.

465
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,520
It provides an ability
to access the tools to go

466
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,380
and make things happen.

467
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,810
And that's sort of like having the hands

468
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,968
to go and do the work.

469
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:54,480
But without trust, none of this matters.

470
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,720
And so the final layer
of this is the trust.

471
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,420
It is sort of like having an ID badge.

472
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,700
What is the agent's identity?

473
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,980
Who are they operating on behalf?

474
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,420
What are their authorizations
to execute and do this task?

475
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,040
And then what are the guardrails

476
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,200
that they are going to operate within,

477
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,020
to make sure that they're
doing this safely?

478
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,690
And so let's double
click on each one of them

479
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,330
and say, what are some of
the implication in terms

480
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,960
of technical choices that we have to make?

481
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,810
So the first thing is that
agents need intelligence.

482
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,760
Now in a, in an ideal world, we would want

483
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,240
the most intelligent agent
at the lowest possible price

484
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,640
at the fastest possible speed

485
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,590
that we want to optimize
on all three of them.

486
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,200
But in real life, based on your use case,

487
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,360
based on the problem that
you're trying to solve,

488
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,860
you might not need all three
of these in equal measure.

489
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,410
In fact, there is a trade off.

490
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,190
So if you're working with an
agent that is legal agent,

491
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,330
you might say, hey, you know what?

492
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,502
I cannot compromise on
accuracy and intelligence here,

493
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:09,210
but I'm okay if it takes
half a day or few more hours

494
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,550
or even a day to gimme the response.

495
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,860
So I'm going to optimize for intelligence,

496
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,610
but I'm okay to trade
off on speed of response.

497
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,380
On the other hand, if you're dealing

498
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,770
with a customer service
agent, you want fast,

499
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,950
quick responses because your
customers are not going to

500
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,280
wait for 10 minutes for agent to come back

501
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,800
with a hundred percent accurate answer.

502
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,280
And so this is where
you optimize for speed,

503
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,390
but then you can trade off
on intelligence or the cost.

504
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,150
And this is why when we are thinking

505
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,470
of enabling the intelligence
in the agentic system,

506
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,430
the choice of models, having
access to different types

507
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,130
of model is very important

508
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,330
because every model has
a different strength.

509
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,670
Some models are good with reasoning,

510
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,490
others are very good with quick responses.

511
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,250
Some do text-based task really well,

512
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,330
others do images and
mathematical task really well.

513
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,020
And so this is why our
approach with Amazon Bedrock

514
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,240
has been to make the broadest

515
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,400
and the widest set of models available,

516
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,120
including open source model,
Amazon's own model with Nova,

517
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,370
as well as a lot of third party models.

518
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,300
And we see this application
inside of Amazon businesses

519
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,880
across our company.

520
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,130
Take example of pharmacy.

521
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,910
Now at Amazon Pharmacy, our
goal is to reduce the time

522
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,060
it takes to fill your prescription
and do that accurately.

523
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,580
And sometimes the prescriptions
are handwritten notes.

524
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,310
And this is where we use models

525
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,710
and intelligence to reduce the time

526
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,060
by 90% while reducing
the error rate by 50%.

527
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,940
On the other hand, on Amazon ad site,

528
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,150
we wanna provide the
ability for brands who want

529
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,510
to advertise to take an
image of their product

530
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,850
and actually touch it
up and make it better

531
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,150
and make it a lot more
compelling when they list it.

532
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,970
And this is where we optimize for ability

533
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,490
to generate compelling images.

534
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,053
On the prime video side,

535
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:16,773
any, any football fans in the house?

536
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,811
All right, some of you?

537
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:21,450
If, if you're like me,
you always join the game

538
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,970
a little bit late and then
you're like, what did I miss?

539
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,520
And so you have the
feature of rapid recap,

540
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,830
which is where model is going and saying,

541
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,500
here are the key things
or key plays that happen

542
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,620
and let me catch you up as you comment.

543
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,660
Or next gen stats, which actually provides

544
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,090
lot more probability and
information to the viewer,

545
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,130
bringing them closer to the action.

546
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,180
All of these use cases
require different behaviors

547
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,713
and different models.

548
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:53,973
Take example of our customer, Syngenta.

549
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,810
Now farming, if you think about it, is a,

550
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,350
is one of the most complex
multi-variate problem, right?

551
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,010
A farmer has to take into
account so many different things.

552
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,430
What is the weather
condition? What seed to plant?

553
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,660
When do I plant it? What pesticide to use?

554
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,540
How much should I spray?
Do I fertilize or not?

555
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,070
When do I fertilize it?

556
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,460
Now these are just the factors
that are in their control,

557
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,240
but they're all dependent on
so many other external factors.

558
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,810
The soil condition, the
moisture, the weather pattern,

559
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,840
the pest activity in that particular area.

560
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,100
And this is why Syngenta work with AWS

561
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,770
to develop Cropwise AI, a series of agents

562
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,400
that take information from
multiple different data sources

563
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,220
including soil condition,
historical yield,

564
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,080
the seed quality, but also
80,000 different growth stages

565
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,820
of crop to provide specific
action plan to farmers

566
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,040
on what they need to do when.

567
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,070
Including here's the
prediction of what might happen

568
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,610
next week and this is what
you should be doing right now,

569
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,550
increasing the yield 5%.

570
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,380
Now again, that is sustainable,

571
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,860
but it is also providing
a direct business outcome,

572
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,250
making it easier for the farmers.

573
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,200
So we talked about intelligence,

574
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,110
but as I said, just having
intelligence is sort

575
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,290
of like having a brain
but not an ability to add.

576
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,050
So let's talk about context.

577
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,140
Now, context is sometimes misunderstood

578
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,630
as this is all about just data.

579
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,410
But as I'll show you,
context is lot more than just

580
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,420
your existing data.

581
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,580
In fact, there's a tongue
in cheek statement,

582
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,750
and by the way, this is tongue in cheek,

583
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,130
so take it with that,

584
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,520
from a senior scientist at
Amazon that talks about the fact

585
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,040
that like if you think about this,

586
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,670
anything out of an LLM is a hallucination.

587
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,130
It is our job because
it's basically predicting

588
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,760
the next token and the world.

589
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,600
But it is our job to
provide it the right context

590
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,600
to make sure that that
hallucination is relevant to

591
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,030
what we are trying to solve for.

592
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,630
And this is why there
is a growing importance

593
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,319
of context engineering.

594
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:14,430
When we think about just
optimizing the prompt,

595
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,780
you're just providing a
one-time input with text.

596
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,990
Now sometimes you give one
shot, you give multiple example,

597
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,450
but it is still back and forth.

598
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,000
With context in your organization,

599
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,910
especially when you're
targeting complex workflow,

600
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,750
you need agents to understand
the role, the hierarchy,

601
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,570
the data, the system, the tools.

602
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,270
And this is why we are seeing emergence

603
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,390
of context engineering
roles in this competency

604
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,550
in many of the organizations.

605
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,820
So to provide this context,
let's talk about what are some

606
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,430
of the technical
capabilities that you need.

607
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,000
The first thing is that
agents need to understand

608
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,850
the relationships in your data.

609
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,900
And take example of a
relationship looks like, right?

610
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,380
Gartner evaluates magic quadrant

611
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,700
and magic quadrant evaluates
technology vendors, right?

612
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,270
That's the relationship
between different objects

613
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,460
and domain inside of your data.

614
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,040
If you're a retailer, if
you're a media company,

615
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,340
if you are a bank, you have many objects,

616
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,950
whether it is customer,
transaction, their trade,

617
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,770
their viewership behavior, where you need

618
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,550
to establish this relationship
so that agents understand

619
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,040
how to navigate your workflows.

620
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,137
And this is why knowledge graph

621
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,773
becomes important in your data strategy.

622
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,430
The second thing that agents
need is that they need

623
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,480
to understand semantics,
which is the adjacency.

624
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,550
Because especially around adaptation

625
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,060
and understanding the ambiguity,
you're not always going

626
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,660
to have an exit term that
an agent is going to go

627
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,460
and search and look for.

628
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,460
This is why they need to
understand what is closer

629
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,200
to what other thing.

630
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
So in this example, if we were

631
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,910
to envision this in a
three dimensional space,

632
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,660
cat and dogs both are pets, so
they're closer to each other.

633
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,920
And Gartner magic quadrant

634
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,040
and the leading cloud
providers are sort of far away

635
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,630
from cats and dog.

636
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,230
But if you actually go
into second dimension,

637
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,380
cats and dog are not the same family

638
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,910
and so they are farther apart

639
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,580
and the Gartner Magic
Quadrant is a lot closer

640
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,410
to the leading cloud provider.

641
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,211
And this is why the semantic
understanding of your data

642
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:34,950
is what AI and agents need.

643
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,820
And this is where vector
databases come into play.

644
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,880
Because vector is the
language that agents speak,

645
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,700
it provides that you need to
provide them relationship,

646
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,400
you need to provide them the semantics.

647
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,400
But all of this won't matter
if you don't have the memory.

648
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,882
And when it comes to
memory, I wanna focus on

649
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:59,793
the bottom right, the four
things on the bottom right.

650
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,550
Think about priming.

651
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,150
Now, priming is sort of like a mindset.

652
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,070
It's giving a role to your agent

653
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,220
that you are a financial service agent.

654
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,530
That means you're staying in character,

655
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,860
you understand what the
role you are playing.

656
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,070
You then have procedural
memory which provides

657
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,050
the agent the how, right?

658
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,473
This is our email system, this is our ERP.

659
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:31,200
And so they have the ability
to remember who I am,

660
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,050
what I'm allowed to do and where it is.

661
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,670
Then you have Symantec.

662
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,490
Symantec is sort of like
your world knowledge.

663
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,510
So the memory needs to
understand not just all

664
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,680
of the knowledge that is
available in the world,

665
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,030
but also understand here
is my Q3 sales strategy

666
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,270
and then finally the
episodic memory so that

667
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,820
agents remember what happened last time.

668
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,530
So hey, you know, this particular invoice,

669
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,600
as I shared in the AP example,

670
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,770
had issues four times in previous run.

671
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,380
So I better remember to
address this next time

672
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,470
when I'm encountering this problem.

673
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,500
Because if you don't
provide memory to the agent,

674
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,720
it is sort of like
having a goldfish, right?

675
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,680
It forgets everything and then
you don't get the outcome.

676
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,800
And that creates not only
poor customer experience,

677
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,020
it also destroys some of those behaviors

678
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,990
that I talked about earlier
that it needs to get better,

679
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,430
it needs to remember,

680
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,400
it needs to constantly
optimize and improve.

681
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,550
So we talked about in the
context the relationship

682
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,930
and knowledge graph, semantics,
the vector databases,

683
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,530
four different types of
memory that the agent needs.

684
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,010
But a lot of us know,
especially in large enterprises,

685
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,460
that a lot of our content
is not even in databases,

686
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,960
it is actually in documents

687
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,130
that look like this, right?

688
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,800
And they are designed
typically for all of us

689
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,600
as humans to understand.

690
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,790
We know when we look at this memo to say

691
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,630
it is a large bolded test-
text that looks like a title,

692
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,000
there are section with
numbering and the bullets,

693
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,980
that means I'm looking at a list,

694
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,110
there's a paragraph and a break.

695
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,950
We know how to read
this, but agents don't.

696
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:18,900
And this is where we need to
focus on taking the content

697
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,970
that is in a lot of these documents

698
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:25,230
and convert that into .md
machine readable files

699
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,240
that are friendlier to agent.

700
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,790
Here's a wonderful example from Stripe

701
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,860
and you can read more about it in terms of

702
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,100
what they have published,
but which is taking our SOPs,

703
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,870
our documents, our workflows,
our org charts, and making

704
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,340
into machine readable agent
friendly documentation.

705
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,418
Because it's the combination
of structured data, memory,

706
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,240
as well as content which is
going to give the ability

707
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,940
for agents to have this context.

708
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,820
And then the final piece
of this context is ability

709
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,573
to access the tools and
actually take action.

710
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:04,800
Now before MCP model context
protocol, those of you

711
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,430
who have dealt with lot of APIs know this,

712
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,800
that every time when you don't
have a standard protocol,

713
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,840
you're trying to connect to a system,

714
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,530
you're building a point
to point integration

715
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,620
and that is very, very difficult to scale.

716
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,300
What MCP has done is it's
sort of like a USC port

717
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,300
for giving agent an ability
to access a lot of your tools.

718
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,150
And it allows you to
have a standard interface

719
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,090
across your systems,
your tools, your data,

720
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,270
so that agents have the context
and an ability to access

721
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,120
the tool and the
information that they need.

722
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,910
So the combination of these pieces,

723
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,860
the relationship, semantics,
memory, better content

724
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,490
and MCP or any other
protocol that actually allows

725
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,780
it to access to the tool,
allows us to move from data

726
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,380
just being an asset, which we
have heard many, many times

727
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,560
to actually having
knowledge as a capability.

728
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Because when we are leading
in intelligent autonomy,

729
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,460
we need an ability for
humans and agent to share

730
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,460
the knowledge and be
able to share back that

731
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,500
with each other as well.

732
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,440
And we see this that when
you provide the context,

733
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,680
the outcomes are amazing.

734
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,540
Rufus is Amazon's shopping assistant

735
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,970
and it provides personalized
contextual advice.

736
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,860
So if you're, you know, buying something

737
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,430
and say, does it need AAA
battery or AA battery,

738
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,330
or hey, I bought this
other thing in the past,

739
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,310
does it actually work with the product

740
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,350
that I've already bought?

741
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:48,010
This year alone, over 250
million shoppers have used Rufus

742
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,870
throughout the year, and
those who use Rufus are

743
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,780
60% more likely to complete a purchase.

744
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,510
And that happens because Rufus understands

745
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,880
and maintains the context and provides

746
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,373
the useful information to the customer.

747
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,810
The last piece is the trust.

748
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,720
Because an intelligent
agent that has an ability

749
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,750
and the context, but the
one that we cannot trust

750
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,200
will never scale in an enterprise.

751
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,770
And one way we can be
sure about the trust is

752
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,950
by setting guardrails.

753
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,590
And as part of Amazon Bedrock, we have m-

754
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,620
we have Amazon Bedrock
guardrails, which allow you

755
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,510
to set specific guardrails
depending on the industry,

756
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,620
your company policy.

757
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,340
For example, before I joined AWS was a CTO

758
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,040
for a global media and
entertainment company.

759
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,594
And that meant that we
could not use certain term

760
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:47,670
during prime time in our show.

761
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,591
Now imagine having to apply this rule

762
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:53,820
agent by agent throughout the enterprise.

763
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,220
Well, that will not scale, right?

764
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,010
But Amazon Bedrock Guardrail allows you

765
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,980
to mention the denied topics to say,

766
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,080
hey, never provide financial advice,

767
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,910
do not mention competitor.

768
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,630
And then that applies to
every agentic workflow

769
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,020
and every model that
you're using from Bedrock.

770
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,240
So you can be confident
that these guardrails

771
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,160
are consistently applied.

772
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,340
Think about the sensitive
information filter, the PII,

773
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,630
you don't want that to be exposed.

774
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,540
You can define some of those
rules in the guardrails.

775
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,110
Contextual grounding checks,
which provides information

776
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,870
to all of your agents
that are at a policy level

777
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,160
to say, you know what?

778
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,500
Our return policy is 90 days.

779
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,720
You define it here and every time

780
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,250
there's an interaction it can.

781
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,010
And if there's a conflict,
guardrail will make sure that

782
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,833
that is grounded in the
policy that you defined there.

783
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,450
But one particular area that
I wanna highlight in the trust

784
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,068
is automated reasoning checks.

785
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:54,810
Now, automated reasoning
checks is a search

786
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:59,130
for a mathematical proof
that a function, a program,

787
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,110
an agent did something
that it was supposed to do.

788
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,543
Now you're doing this mathematically,

789
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,120
and I'll give you an example
of how this actually works.

790
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,010
So let's say we want to say,

791
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,763
how do we know that
Pythagorean Theorem is correct?

792
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:23,100
Well, one way to do this is
to try and draw every symbol-

793
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,160
every single variation
of a triangle and then go

794
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,960
and manually measure
everything to make sure

795
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,940
that the theorem is correct.

796
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,710
But that is not practical, right?

797
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,130
That is not how we can prove
the Pythagorean Theorem.

798
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,230
The way we actually establish that

799
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,920
is by having a mathematical
proof that this is correct

800
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,770
without having to manually go and draw

801
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,860
and measure every single
variation of a triangle.

802
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,070
That is exactly how
automated reasoning works.

803
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,890
And as part of Amazon Bedrock guardrail,

804
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,440
automated reasoning checks are available

805
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,760
that reduce the hallucination by over 99%.

806
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,740
And even before agentic AI,

807
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,810
we've been using automated reasoning

808
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,700
for provable security across
AWS for a number of years.

809
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,300
So S3's public storage and blocking that

810
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,060
or VPC access analyzer where you can say,

811
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,030
hey, does my database
have access to internet?

812
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,400
Well, how do you actually
prove that mathematically so

813
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,230
that you have approvable security?

814
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,570
We do this through
Automated Reasoning Check.

815
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,740
And that's one of those
tools that allow us to trust

816
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,530
the agent and make sure
that we are able to

817
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,103
effectively scale them in our companies.

818
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,900
I'll share an example from
Amazon Tax and Compliance.

819
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,030
Now, when you're dealing with tax rules

820
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,923
and compliance all over the world,

821
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,490
you have different policies,
different documents,

822
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,070
and again, it's very
difficult to do this manually.

823
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,610
And so our tax and compliance
team worked with agents

824
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,870
to look at 600 different
companies around the world,

825
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,450
including the tax policies and the rules

826
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,070
to do the benchmarking.

827
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,840
Now that's an example where
the trust is very important

828
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,293
and you have the provable
security to establish that trust.

829
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,960
Now after looking at all
of this, when you start

830
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,910
to move agents and operate
multiple agents in production,

831
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,113
it is still hard.

832
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:27,240
It requires you to have
better runtime so that you can

833
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,750
isolate each of the
runtime, as I talked about,

834
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,810
it needs memory so that it
remembers different types

835
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,270
of memory that I mentioned earlier.

836
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,300
You need to provide an
identity to that agent so

837
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,780
that you know who's
that acting on behalf of

838
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,403
and what it is allowed to do.

839
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,860
It needs access to different
tools, it needs gateway

840
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,560
that it can access information from,

841
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,620
and then it needs observability
so that you can validate

842
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,770
and audit and feel
confident that it is doing

843
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,360
what you want it to do.

844
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,780
Now all of this requires a set

845
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,600
of solid primitives.

846
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,060
And if you as senior
leaders, if you go back

847
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,990
to like just basic
components of primitives

848
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,450
or the building blocks, if you had compute

849
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,660
and storage, we pretty much can build

850
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,040
many different application.

851
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,920
You can create a website,
you can create an ERP,

852
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,610
you can create a CRM with
just compute and storage.

853
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,610
We believe that inference is going

854
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,630
to become another building block of all

855
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,130
of the applications that
are going to come out.

856
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,300
And this is why with AgentCore

857
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,730
and Amazon Bedrock, we
provide these building blocks

858
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,920
and perimeters so that all of the things

859
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,060
that I talked about
from identity to memory

860
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,990
to providing access to
the tool across any model,

861
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,540
across any protocol, not just models

862
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,410
that are on Bedrock, AgentCore
allows you to do that.

863
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,240
So that you can provide agent memory,

864
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,660
you can manage the agent identity,
you can provide a runtime

865
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,665
that you know is secure and is isolated,

866
00:43:06,665 --> 00:43:08,640
you can provide the gateway

867
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,460
that manages the connection
with the other tools.

868
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,310
And this is why we are
pretty excited about

869
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,253
what we can build using these primitives.

870
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,360
Now, one of the questions
we often get from leaders is

871
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,943
what are some good places to get started?

872
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,820
Now, as I talked about earlier,

873
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,320
while this is not automation,
it is also not full autonomy.

874
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,630
It- they are still early days.

875
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,107
And so let's keep in mind that
these are still early days

876
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:39,480
and we make sure that we don't think

877
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,120
of agents as a magic wand.

878
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,720
In fact, if you have
a predictable workflow

879
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,560
with fixed steps, very limited tool use,

880
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,610
then just basic automation,
some gen AI assistant works.

881
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,750
Agents are really good when you
want dynamic tool selection,

882
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,450
when you want to take
advantage of that adaptability

883
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,870
and learning where you want
to do pattern recognition

884
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,380
and matching, where you are
looking at things like latency

885
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,140
and the cost implication
based on the business problem

886
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,790
that you're trying to solve.

887
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,230
And the three specific areas
where we see the biggest value

888
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,840
is in software development,
customer support

889
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,050
and customer care and the
knowledge work, especially when

890
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,430
you're handling exception
loop type processes.

891
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,100
Now, how many of you
in the room do not have

892
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,363
any technical debt?

893
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:33,630
(audience laughing)

894
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,580
Well, that was a trick question.

895
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,560
Pretty much all of us have technical debt,

896
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,690
and that's a wonderful example

897
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,960
where agents can actually
help us move fast.

898
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,590
Because paying off technical
debt locks in a lot

899
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,310
of our engineering resources
into doing something

900
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,657
that must be done, but doesn't
always necessarily give

901
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:56,280
better business outcome or features.

902
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,410
It is sort of like managing the risk.

903
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,800
And here's an example
from Thomson Reuters.

904
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,280
They had a lot of .net
legacy code that they had

905
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,730
to modernize and they use AWS transform,

906
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,970
which is our agentic AI
based modernization agent.

907
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,560
And they were able to reduce

908
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,500
and move that modernization 4x faster.

909
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,070
That meant that their
product and engineering teams

910
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,340
can actually solve the business
problems rather than just

911
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,600
paying off the debt.

912
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,200
And so this is a wonderful
example where agents are already

913
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,600
helping us drive better outcomes.

914
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,430
So I would look at your businesses
and find areas like that

915
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,040
where you can start to apply the agent.

916
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,820
Now, none of this matters
if we don't prepare our

917
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,210
organizations with skill and training.

918
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,390
And this is why over last 25 years,

919
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,270
we have invested heavily into the training

920
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,353
and certification.

921
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,270
To build the competency
across not only the companies,

922
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,610
but around the countries,
across the world,

923
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,400
so that we have the
right talent as leaders

924
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,750
to take advantage of this.

925
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,780
A lot of this training
is available for free,

926
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,940
so I encourage not only all of you,

927
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,820
but also encourage your teams
to take advantage of it.

928
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,600
One of my favorite things
here is the AWS AI League.

929
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,240
What I've found leading
product and engineering teams

930
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,110
for a long time is that
gamification is always

931
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,930
a great way to get people highly engaged.

932
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,690
It's a low friction way,
you're making it fun,

933
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,340
people get to learn something.

934
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,410
And that's what AWS AI League does.

935
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,830
Where you can actually host
a competitive fun league

936
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,240
inside of your own company.

937
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,970
We also, I believe, announced
yesterday that there's going

938
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,840
to be a championship
league with $50,000 price

939
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,300
where teams can compete into.

940
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,540
And finally, you're going to need experts

941
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,863
and we are here to help.

942
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,430
There is guidance from AWS experts,

943
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,460
many of the folks from our
executive and residence team

944
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,250
and other experts throughout the company.

945
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,550
We have made over a hundred
million dollar investment

946
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,220
in AWS generative AI Innovation Center

947
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,670
where we bring machine
learning and AI experts from

948
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,300
all over the company to work
alongside you to help you

949
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,310
solve a business problem.

950
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,875
And then AWS marketplace where
you can quickly get access

951
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:21,480
to some of the prebuilt agents
and tools that you can start

952
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,750
to deploy today in your organization.

953
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,040
It is really a fascinating
and fantastic future

954
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,820
that is ahead of you, and
I'm really excited to see

955
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,950
what you all build together.

956
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,040
I hope you have a fantastic
re:Invent and rest of the week.

957
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,930
Thank you so much.

958
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,377
(audience applause)
