1
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,038
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Steve

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:06,320
uh Van Wyk or Van Wyk, whichever rolls

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,299
off the tongue easier.

4
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,720
Um, I currently head up the

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,750
global team at SAP

6
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,560
which looks after technology and innovation

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,720
within the S4 business, um, so the

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,510
RS Organization,

9
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,109
and we help our customers move from an on-premise world

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,818
into cloud.

11
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,850
Today, we're gonna talk a little around um the

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,239
need for change within businesses. Um,

13
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,449
we're gonna give you a little bit of insight into what we're seeing

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,888
with our customers, the ones that are moving from an on-premise

15
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:32,189
world to rise, uh,

16
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:34,450
because this is a little distance, so I don't need those

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,719
anymore. Um, we'll talk a little

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,340
around the North Star for SAP. So what is the strategy,

19
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,779
um, from an SAP perspective around cloud,

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,399
uh, a bit around the customer journey, uh, uh,

21
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,509
the rise with SAP methodology. So the

22
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:47,478
customers that are

23
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,079
moving from an on-premise world into the cloud space,

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,319
um, what that looks like.

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,759
Uh, we will touch a little bit on the cleaner

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,539
core environment,

27
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:56,918
uh, and why it's so important when you're looking

28
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:58,098
in the cloud scenarios.

29
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:00,630
Um, we'll, we'll touch on the integrated tool chain,

30
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,779
which is some of the tool set which will help you accelerate

31
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:03,389
the cloud.

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,799
And finally, right at the end, we'll bring it all together, so

33
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,219
hopefully, it makes a little bit of sense.

34
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,040
OK. So, uh, some of the customers in terms

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,219
of, uh, conversations that we've been having,

36
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,500
uh, I love this analogy. Uh,

37
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:18,680
it's, uh, in the early 1900s, effectively,

38
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,469
this is New York City. Um,

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,799
and basically, it's Fifth Avenue. And if you look

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,659
on the left-hand side, it was a horse-driven

41
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,668
cart environment in, in the early 1900s.

42
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,638
And, uh, just 13 years later,

43
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,760
you can see the picture on the right-hand side around automobiles.

44
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,939
And I mean, the history of man is

45
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,058
one of innovation, right? So we've innovated

46
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,058
since the beginning of time and we continue to

47
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,049
do so today.

48
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,579
And technology is the accelerator and the enabler

49
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:43,659
that does that today.

50
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,760
Um a little around SAP. Uh

51
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,058
we've been around 53 years, which is exactly

52
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,099
how old I am, so it makes me feel pretty

53
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,338
good. Um, the company started

54
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:55,459
back in uh the early 70s when, with

55
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,719
the release of R1,

56
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,620
which was um effectively a transaction

57
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,730
processing system that literally looked at

58
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,730
a business process

59
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,219
and mapped it back into a, a computer

60
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,409
system. Uh we released R2

61
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,479
in the 80s and that really was

62
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,500
what we call the real-time uh computing

63
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
system. Uh, effectively, we put into a

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,199
GL structure.

65
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,710
And there was no day-end processing into the GL

66
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,979
or month-end processing, so we called it a real-time

67
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,129
platform. Uh, in the 90s,

68
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:23,360
we released um server

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,179
or released uh server 3,

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,538
which essentially was a client-server architecture.

71
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,659
So for customers who were operating on

72
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,778
a global uh entity that were looking at

73
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,219
multi-language environments, that were looking at multi-day

74
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,528
end, month-end closes,

75
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,088
uh, year-end closes, etc. So different,

76
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,210
um, different time zones of

77
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,338
operation, right? Um,

78
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,770
and then we brought out in the early 2003,

79
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,139
somewhere around there, we brought out something called the SAP

80
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:47,740
Business Suite.

81
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:50,538
And you'll recognize that name because that's where we are

82
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,729
today with the SAP business suite based in cloud.

83
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,099
And that's where we decoupled some of the lines of business,

84
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:57,758
HR, SRM, supply, uh, uh,

85
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,288
uh, CRM for example,

86
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,838
from the core set of financials and customers had the choice

87
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:04,149
to roll out the financials and then at a later stage,

88
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,419
either deploy alternative solutions around

89
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,919
line of business or alternatively,

90
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,490
uh, just couple on the, uh, the lines of business,

91
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,659
right? And then we brought out in 2010,

92
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,860
we brought out something called in-memory computing. We invented

93
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,270
an in-memory database called HANA,

94
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,338
which allowed you to insert a, a transaction

95
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,860
and then run queries against the transaction

96
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,038
milliseconds later.

97
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,419
It changed the way that uh customers were

98
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,939
consuming information. There was no latency of data

99
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,058
anymore, and we called it a real-time operating

100
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:30,639
platform.

101
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,139
And in the early 2010s, we started looking

102
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,460
into things like predictive algorithms and we acquired

103
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,300
companies along the way like KXEN.

104
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,409
Which essentially allowed us to take

105
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,110
uh a business process, look at the business

106
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,179
process and splice in some predictive algorithms

107
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:46,429
into the process so that you would end up at a different

108
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:48,508
state depending on who was interacting

109
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,250
with the actual business process itself.

110
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,830
That morphed into something called machine learning

111
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,088
and automated um deliverables

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,389
where literally what you could do is you could look at some of

113
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,969
the business processes and figure out

114
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,788
how to reduce the human interaction with the business

115
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,960
process. And we brought out something called the intelligent

116
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,149
enterprise, which literally had machine learning

117
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,830
built into it.

118
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,508
And that in itself morphed into where we are

119
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:12,439
today, which is + 2022, 2023.

120
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,319
We have

121
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,879
uh a cloud ERP and the cloud, of

122
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,000
course, and we have artificial intelligence, which is

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,238
actually built into the application layer

124
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,720
itself. Um,

125
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,769
If you look at all these disruptions that we launched to market,

126
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,129
so R1, R2, R3, we certainly

127
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,100
disrupted the way that the industry was,

128
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,649
was operating and, and we led the way in, in

129
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,410
terms of enterprise resource planning.

130
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,059
As it is today with artificial intelligence, I

131
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,059
personally think it's the greatest invention that

132
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,439
humankind has created in its whole

133
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,699
history, and I do believe it's not only changing

134
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,730
the way that we're operating today, but will change the

135
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,338
way for

136
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,939
the way we're gonna do business for decades to come. And

137
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,939
certainly the aggregate of all these disruptions

138
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,278
over time doesn't come close

139
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,980
to where we are today with the cloud version of, of the

140
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,600
solution area.

141
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,059
Some of the global disruptions that are happening in the

142
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:00,298
industry, and they happen by themselves. They,

143
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,459
they're actually independent of your organization and

144
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,410
your company, right?

145
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,939
But if you look at the geopolitical tensions that are

146
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,019
going on in the world, tariff wars that are, are

147
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:10,298
on, we've got wars that are happening in the Ukraine.

148
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,889
It changes the way migration patterns work, consumption

149
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:13,619
patterns work,

150
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,899
supply chains work. Um, pretty

151
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,959
much the backdrop of

152
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,338
how we're operating today is to talk about it

153
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:21,500
and say, well, the acceleration of change

154
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,209
is the norm in the industry today.

155
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,738
And certainly in the markets that we're operating in.

156
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,220
And as a result, one has to start thinking about,

157
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,420
well, how do I think about model expansion?

158
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,928
How do I think about shaving out costs within my business?

159
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,379
How do I look at taking advantage of opportunities

160
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:36,129
in the market

161
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,738
through either through mergers and acquisitions? How do

162
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,980
I acquire more customers for my business, etc.

163
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,639
All of these things require us

164
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,149
to have a, a technology platform

165
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,480
that allows us to drive continuous innovation.

166
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,278
And the reality is technology is the enabler.

167
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,608
Um, so if you look at some of the external

168
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:53,278
studies.

169
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,519
Um, like McKinsey, for example. This

170
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,579
one's quite interesting.

171
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,000
Um, in the history of mankind, if,

172
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,358
if I think about the, the S&P 500 companies

173
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:04,819
over the last 20 years, since 2005

174
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,829
to 2025,

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,278
only 7 companies are present in

176
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:10,939
the same set of results.

177
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,509
OK. And if you look at it, it's quite an

178
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:14,790
interesting comparison, right?

179
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,278
Because actually, technology companies are the ones that

180
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:19,358
are accelerating um into the

181
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,369
top um uh 20

182
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,259
companies for the last 25 years.

183
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,059
Um, so if you think about organizations

184
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,278
like Kodak, for example, if you think about

185
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,750
BlackBerry, um, these are organizations

186
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,819
that kind of weren't in touch with what's going

187
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,000
on in the, in the space and as a result,

188
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,970
ended up, um, in a, in a space which

189
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,939
obviously deteriorated as a company.

190
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,608
Um, and so what our mission in life is to help

191
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,899
customers, obviously, we wanna

192
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,980
help the world run better, but certainly we wanna make sure

193
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,100
that our customers have longevity and they

194
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,170
do take advantages of, of what's going on in

195
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,798
the industry.

196
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,809
I love this quote by Peter Drucker. Anybody that's been

197
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,019
to a business school has read a book by Peter Drucker.

198
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,528
He's seen as the forefather of modern management.

199
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,290
The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not

200
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,290
the turbulence. It's the act of

201
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,988
yesterday's logic.

202
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,869
And quite often, when you're standing in

203
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,910
front of a customer and having a conversation with

204
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,230
them, you realize that people are dogmatic

205
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,389
to change and we all fear it.

206
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,259
And so as a result, one of the components of

207
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,290
conversation we're having with the customer today

208
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,619
is around adaptability. How does customers

209
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,889
adapt to what's going on in a world

210
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,170
that influences the

211
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,829
operating environment in which they, they're currently

212
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:28,879
doing business today.

213
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,678
I put this up as an interesting analogy, right? So

214
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:35,079
SAP still has an on-premise business. We

215
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,738
still sell software on-premise and we still have customers,

216
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,119
um, that we, uh, we manage

217
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,670
enhancements and upgrades with.

218
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:44,278
The light gray line in the middle is, in fact,

219
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
the enhancement release over a period of

220
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,988
time. So we release that to market.

221
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,540
That's the on-premise target adoption. And

222
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,879
the gray line underneath is when customers actually

223
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,119
spend the time adopting it,

224
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:57,059
which, by the way, has a gap of up to 7 years.

225
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:00,369
So when you think about a release that comes from us, which

226
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:02,569
is an enhancement of any shape, form, or size

227
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,338
within the software,

228
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:04,649
we give it to the customer.

229
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:07,250
And between the scheduling and programming that IT

230
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,790
goes through,

231
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:10,088
because of the constraints that they're under,

232
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:12,608
effectively, they only roll it out 7 years after

233
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:13,149
the fact.

234
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,480
All right. And uh that seems to be the

235
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,250
average norm.

236
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,678
Now, when you think about IT and business, there is

237
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:22,178
a wedge that seems to be growing between the two

238
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,199
organizations. Business is very much aware

239
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,319
of the, the hostile environment in which

240
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,278
they're operating in,

241
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,040
and IT still has the burden of compliance certification

242
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,439
and infrastructure management.

243
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,080
A large part of the customer base has lifted and shifted

244
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,200
some of that software and put it into a hyperscaler

245
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,619
like AWS for sure.

246
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,178
And for them in a subscription model,

247
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,668
we believe we're in the cloud.

248
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,989
The challenge is the agility. The challenge

249
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,658
is the compliance and certification

250
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:48,067
because IT still has to perform those functions.

251
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,729
So the programmatic approach that IT delivers

252
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,769
within an organization anywhere up to 12 months

253
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:53,558
in advance

254
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:56,048
is 25% around managed services and,

255
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:58,158
and contracts around managed services, finding the

256
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:58,889
right skill set,

257
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,288
deciding what gets upgraded to begin with.

258
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,928
And as business wants to pull away and make some

259
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:05,928
decisions around how do I modify my business

260
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,048
process, how do I go to market, take advantage

261
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,570
of new opportunities, etc.

262
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:12,080
IT has to push back and go, we've got all these

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,769
compliance things that we need to deal with. With

264
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,580
and so as a result, we can't deliver on that, right?

265
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:19,158
And there is definitely a wedge that's going on.

266
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,469
And what we see within the customer base

267
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:22,200
is we see

268
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,469
typically is that customers start building what

269
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,129
we call technical debt, OK.

270
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,450
So effectively, they go out to the business, uh, uh,

271
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,558
they go out to the world, business goes out to the world.

272
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,788
They've got some departmental budget, they go and buy

273
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,239
some software and they start implementing stuff themselves

274
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,580
and then try and figure out how the integration works.

275
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,538
And that's where you get the,

276
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,989
the technical debt starting to grow within the business.

277
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,330
There are challenges and when

278
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,820
A customer then starts need to think about how

279
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,308
do I upgrade, how do I move forward with innovations,

280
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:49,580
and that then speaks to the seven-year lag

281
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,509
in terms of the

282
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,340
innovation.

283
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,869
In a cloud-delivered world, in a, uh,

284
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,200
that compliance and certification and infrastructure

285
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,840
management

286
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,399
is delivered by SAP as a service. It's

287
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,558
a single throat to choke, and effectively what ends

288
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,629
up happening is we provide you managed services,

289
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,190
your infrastructure, we'll keep your software up and running,

290
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,538
and we'll make sure that all the enhancements are available

291
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:11,710
to you to consume. Whether it's in a private

292
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,149
or a public cloud environment.

293
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,759
What does that mean from IT? Because we release

294
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,759
you from the burden of compliance and

295
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,668
certification,

296
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,000
that means you can start focusing on innovation

297
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,639
for the business.

298
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,200
And our experience tells us that when we

299
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,259
spend time with a business, they tend to have

300
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,399
strategic objectives that they wanna drive,

301
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,879
but it's the operational objectives underneath

302
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,940
that, that they don't

303
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,349
explore to any great degree. Why?

304
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,820
Because IT can't support that deliverable.

305
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
So there's about 20% of availability

306
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,570
of time to focus on innovation, and it'll be

307
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,899
exploring the tires, kicking the tires around AI,

308
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,298
kicking the tires around innovation, making

309
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:48,428
sure that the integration is working, for example.

310
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:50,899
And when business wants to ideate around the future,

311
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,379
there's not enough time to do that

312
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,979
within the 20% of time available in the 12-month

313
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:57,099
period. So when you move that

314
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,178
to a cloud service, what typically happens is that

315
00:10:59,178 --> 00:10:59,940
flips on its head.

316
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,570
You end up with 80% of your time availability. So

317
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,899
what does that mean? That means business and IT

318
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,979
can focus on what is the future of

319
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:09,058
the organization together and start

320
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:11,129
ideating on what does the future look like.

321
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:13,330
And that operational um strategic

322
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,558
intent gets delivered as a result.

323
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,048
OK. Uh, a little bit around some of the

324
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,058
technology trends that are going on in the industry, which have

325
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,178
nothing to do with SAP but it's worth mentioning.

326
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,619
This is something that customers need to consider

327
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,058
as you're moving forward to the cloud and as you're making

328
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:32,239
decisions around whether you're staying on-premise, whether you're

329
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,538
moving to the cloud. These are some of the strategic

330
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:35,379
thought processes.

331
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,928
If you think about the top left-hand side, uh,

332
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,808
supercomputing,

333
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,178
if I took all the data that

334
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,178
has ever been created in the whole of history and

335
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:45,080
put it into a single server in AWS,

336
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,479
we're gonna double the size of the data in 2 months.

337
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,710
OK. So that's as fast as

338
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,729
we are growing data in this world. Why?

339
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,869
Because of the mobile phone. Everybody takes 1520,

340
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:56,940
30 selfies,

341
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:57,889
uses one,

342
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,389
and basically never deletes anything, and everything else

343
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,500
goes into the cloud. OK. It's just in

344
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,259
human nature,

345
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,190
effect of us.

346
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,504
deleting anything.

347
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,884
I've been at SAP 16 years. I can go back

348
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,043
16 years and I can find the first email I

349
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,004
received from the CEO saying, Welcome to SAP.

350
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,835
Hope you have a great career with us.

351
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,234
And why didn't I delete it? Cause it's

352
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,695
just not in my nature to do so.

353
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,104
And human beings, unfortunately, don't do that.

354
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,604
So when we create data structures

355
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,764
within databases, we never delete them, recreate

356
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:25,783
them. If we create

357
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,524
analytical reports, we never delete them and recreate

358
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:30,634
them. As new people come on board, they simply push it

359
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,585
aside and go, I'll create this stuff again.

360
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,450
That's just human nature.

361
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:37,558
The second big trend that's going on is, um,

362
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,460
is in quantum computing.

363
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,190
It's a combination of mathematics, um, computer

364
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,700
science,

365
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,649
and the physical hardware itself.

366
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,269
What does that essentially mean? In layman's terms, it means

367
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,590
that some of the most complicated calculations

368
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,168
in humankind that we can think of, which

369
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,529
includes something like managing the human genome,

370
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,908
for example,

371
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,509
uh, would take conventional supercomputing

372
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,710
around 20,000 years to calculate. Quantum

373
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,950
computing tells us that we can do it under 5 minutes.

374
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,729
That changes the way that we operate or think

375
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,009
about operating a business,

376
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,619
particularly in things like life sciences, for example.

377
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,168
Also, when you think about artificial intelligence, we're

378
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,649
gonna have to think about new ways of saving data

379
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,889
because AI is used for nefarious intent

380
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,070
as much as I think it's gonna change the world.

381
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:22,090
It takes AI approximately 3.5

382
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,090
seconds to mimic your voice and it takes

383
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,269
about 5.5 seconds to mimic your face.

384
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,070
So picture this scenario.

385
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,750
There is a bank manager.

386
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,479
Who I don't know whether he's still currently employed

387
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,038
in Europe and uh

388
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,440
he got contacted by an artificial intelligence

389
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,700
and, and it was well crafted and created

390
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,509
to such a degree that he thought he was talking to his boss

391
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,879
and he ended up transferring $35 million

392
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,219
in his banking system without proper authorization

393
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,899
because his boss insisted that he did so.

394
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,359
And it was done through an artificial intelligence. Now you

395
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,369
can imagine. Um,

396
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,509
doing that in a private capacity where you'll have

397
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,668
your son phone you or daughter phone you going, hey,

398
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,590
mom, dad,

399
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:01,190
I apologize, but, uh, I left my wallet at home. I'm

400
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,250
driving. Can you give me my Social Security number?

401
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,750
And because I've got a credit card number and what have you, I

402
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,869
can buy a whole bunch of stuff on your behalf and it's,

403
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,029
it's more difficult to prove that you didn't purchase

404
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,149
it versus you did.

405
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,288
So AI is gonna be a challenge. Cybersecurity

406
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,830
is gonna be very, very important for us

407
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,879
to start locking down this data. So, cryptography

408
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,889
is gonna be a new way of looking at how

409
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,090
we're doing that, and that leads us to cybersecurity.

410
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,489
750,000 jobs available in the

411
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,509
US alone in cybersecurity right now.

412
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:30,070
OK. And the reason for that is because

413
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,038
Uh, it normally takes about 9 months to figure out that you've

414
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,058
had a data breach. You only get about 4 months,

415
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,239
or 4% of the data

416
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,418
back, 4 to 6%, somewhere around there.

417
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:42,259
And the reality is that that is gone. OK.

418
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,879
Uh, since I've joined, and moved to the

419
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,879
US, for example, I've had 4 breaches on my

420
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,950
credit card. So I've had to cancel a credit card and redo it.

421
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,548
And it's like,

422
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,500
hold on, how do people get my data?

423
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,210
Uh, because I registered my

424
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:56,000
My, uh, home at a home mortgage

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,538
company.

426
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I registered my name on a telephone

427
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,080
line and I've registered in a postal

428
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,239
service and I bought a motorcar. And

429
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,178
those four

430
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:07,070
mean that my personal details are in the public domain

431
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,658
because it just gets sold by anybody in the business, right.

432
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,149
Um, and as a result, my details are out there.

433
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,139
So, interesting.

434
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,389
There is a convergence of the physical and virtual world.

435
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,690
Companies like uh Epic Games,

436
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,389
for example,

437
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,168
with these headsets have spent over $150

438
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,750
million creating virtual real estate.

439
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,558
Companies like Shopify have spent over $80

440
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,599
million trying to think about how it is that they're gonna

441
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,678
operate in an environment which is

442
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:31,269
virtual.

443
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,678
So, I don't know if any of you use YouTube

444
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:36,038
for any shape, form, or size, but the most frustrating

445
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:38,558
thing is I look at more adverts than I do actually

446
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:40,808
content in YouTube at the moment. Unless you purchase

447
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:41,349
a premium

448
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:43,009
kind of environment, right?

449
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,570
It give us new avenue for revenue streams.

450
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,950
So, absolutely, the headset is gonna be

451
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,048
quite an interesting development moving forward.

452
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,340
By 2026, apparently, one third of

453
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,408
the world's population is gonna spend 3.5 hours a

454
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:55,168
day on a headset.

455
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,798
That's a significant amount of people.

456
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,109
So it thinks about new, new avenues to

457
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:01,950
doing business, right?

458
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,668
The 5G network, well, because of the 5G

459
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:06,750
network, there's no latency of connectivity. I

460
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,869
can take a mobile device today. I can take a picture of

461
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,029
something immediately, it hits my transaction system.

462
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,389
I can consume it using AI and make decisions

463
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,479
around it. And the reality is there's no

464
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,859
latency of movement of data.

465
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,840
And the beauty of it is using AI

466
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:21,269
I can ask a question, get an answer, and tomorrow I come

467
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,609
back and do the same thing and get the same answer.

468
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,038
So the consistency of that is quite interesting

469
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:26,869
to see as well.

470
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,279
Artificial intelligence is self-explanatory, and

471
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
I'm absolutely certain you've been to a bunch of presentations

472
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
around it. But for me, what's quite

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,038
interesting at SAP is once I teach AI

474
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,178
to uh connect to a database

475
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
and another database together via APIs,

476
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,259
it can do it by itself.

477
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,979
If I'm sitting with an application sitting here

478
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,090
and data sitting in another application and I can

479
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,009
bridge it using

480
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:51,519
some code, as soon as I write the code, I

481
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,989
can teach AI to do the code.

482
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,408
And today, we have AI that actually writes

483
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:55,950
code.

484
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,609
All right. So I can bridge application to application, which

485
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,808
means I don't need to purchase or rebuild. I

486
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,690
can actually bridge it through an application layer.

487
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,189
And then finally, AI for me is around asking

488
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,588
a question and getting an answer.

489
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,140
So being able to sit there and ask a question within

490
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,809
the landscape in which you're operating,

491
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,420
whether it's SAP data or non-SAP data,

492
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,739
and being able to get that result back so that you can

493
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,239
drive an outcome within the business.

494
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,209
And being able to trust that

495
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,380
information. So all of these are influencing

496
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,420
how the world is operating. Also,

497
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,699
we've come to a new phenomenon around lifeline

498
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,098
lifelong learning.

499
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,449
So today,

500
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:31,769
uh, children that are entering primary school, by

501
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,479
the time they graduate and, and go to university,

502
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,848
26% of jobs that we know

503
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,199
today will be available. The rest are gonna be obsolete.

504
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,598
It doesn't mean there won't be jobs. It means that we're gonna have

505
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:42,348
different jobs.

506
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,930
So people need to ebb and flow through learning

507
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,088
culture and understanding how different

508
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,170
pieces of technology work, different functions

509
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,039
within a business work,

510
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,549
because you're not gonna be an accountant for 40 years.

511
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,239
You're gonna be looking at moving within the

512
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,868
organization and we have that within our company.

513
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,630
2.5 years on average, somebody looks

514
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,578
to get into another role within the business.

515
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,279
OK. Um, just in terms of when ERP

516
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,279
was first developed, I use this analogy cause I,

517
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:08,549
I find it quite interesting.

518
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:11,160
The left-hand side, we have a Jaguar Mark II, was

519
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,779
launched in 1955,

520
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
was stopped being made in 1975, but in

521
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,719
its day,

522
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,180
it was obviously an unbelievable machine.

523
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:21,009
It had a beautiful engine that could accelerate,

524
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,368
big 3 L motor,

525
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:25,170
4 L motor. It could do uh

526
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,449
unbelievable speeds.

527
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,809
It had a retractable seatbelt, which was one

528
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,930
of the first of its kind. So you could pull the seatbelt

529
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,039
down and you could release it and it would suck it

530
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,719
back up again.

531
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,199
The other thing, and the reason I know this is because my

532
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,039
father had one,

533
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:39,529
is the reality is I could push the a.m. FM

534
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,930
radio and the aerial would come out the bonnet

535
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,969
or come out the hood. Uh, we call it

536
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:44,930
a hood in the US.

537
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:47,479
And for me, that was great cause I used to turn it on and

538
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,568
off and watch this thing pop up and down. That

539
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:51,858
for me was the most advanced

540
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:52,539
technology available.

541
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,618
On the right-hand side, I've got an M4. Uh,

542
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,858
it's a BMW that was launched in the middle of last

543
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,140
year. You can see the capacity and the, and

544
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,269
the, and the comparison between the two vehicles in

545
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:02,959
terms of speed,

546
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,739
the size of the vehicle, the make of the model,

547
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:07,078
and all these good things.

548
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,660
The value of the technology that sits

549
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,059
inside the BMWs, is unbelievable. Electric

550
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,289
seats, electric windows,

551
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,118
heated seats, for example, onboard computers,

552
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,979
um, If I, uh,

553
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,269
for example, was going to a gala

554
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,509
event like this evening, for example, I'd take the jag.

555
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,689
Why? Because I'd wanna impress

556
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:25,930
the heck out of my wife.

557
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,670
And it'd arrive in style, right? James Bond

558
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,828
style in my mind.

559
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,559
Um, but the reality is if I was driving through

560
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,660
Europe, I was on the highway and I was going on a

561
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,299
vacation, I wanna be in the BMW.

562
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,680
Why? Because God forbid I have an accident.

563
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,979
Um, I've got the curtain airbags, and the

564
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,019
best possible chance of survival is

565
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:43,799
in the BMW.

566
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:45,170
The reality is,

567
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,890
why did I show you this? Because I cannot retrofit

568
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,680
the technology that sits in the BMW

569
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,130
back into the Jag. I could probably do a couple

570
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,299
of things like maybe put an onboard GPS system,

571
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,900
etc.

572
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,410
But I can't put the airbags in it and I can't

573
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,019
retrofit the suspension and the capabilities

574
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,250
of, of the actual vehicle itself, uh, OK,

575
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,519
without losing its value.

576
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:04,910
The point is that

577
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,209
this analogy I see very often happening with

578
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:07,838
customers.

579
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,250
Instead of looking at modernizing the technology,

580
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:12,328
we tend to look at pieces of

581
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:14,328
technology that can add value and we create more and

582
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,368
more technical debt

583
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,549
within the landscape in which we operate.

584
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,489
That doesn't bode well when we start thinking about agility

585
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:21,608
within the organization,

586
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,000
right? So just to give you something for a little

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,009
bit of tongue in cheek.

588
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:27,910
When we launched ERP ECC6, we

589
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,068
built it in the 90s.

590
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,469
It was launched in the early 2000s, but in those

591
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,709
days, um, there was no smartphone.

592
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,509
Smartphone was just released, so telephone, mobile

593
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,509
phone was just released.

594
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,828
There was no internet. There was no Amazon, there was

595
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:41,449
no Google. There were no blogs.

596
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:44,390
There was no social networks. There was no e-commerce.

597
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,750
There were no millennials.

598
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,259
There were certainly no app stores. There were no selfies,

599
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:48,979
no FOMO,

600
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,098
fear of missing out, for example.

601
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,529
No Wikipedia, no streaming, no cloud,

602
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:54,219
no AI,

603
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:56,578
no APIs, and no in-memory

604
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:57,098
computing.

605
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,979
And we still have lots of customers operating in this

606
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:00,640
world today.

607
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,269
OK. Uh, in the backdrop of

608
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,568
a world that is accelerating

609
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:06,229
change,

610
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,009
and let's face it, our customers are driving that

611
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,088
behavior. Uh, to give you an example, I've

612
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:13,130
got 5 or 6 apps that we'll call a

613
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,309
taxi in the US.

614
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,930
My first primary goal is to pull an Uber.

615
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:18,809
Why? Because it's integrated into my,

616
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,318
my, uh, uh, uh, costing

617
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:21,848
system.

618
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,920
Uh, if, for example,

619
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,729
uh, I can't, uh, it tells me I get

620
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:28,779
2 minutes for the driver to arrive, yup, OK,

621
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,410
commit.

622
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,939
And then it finds me in driver and comes back 17 minutes

623
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,969
later, I hit the cancel button just for the heck

624
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:36,019
of it. Because why? I'm not loyal to

625
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:38,180
Uber. It's just you promised me something, you didn't

626
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,608
deliver it, so I'm going somewhere else.

627
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,969
And that's exactly what we have with Amazon and a whole

628
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:42,519
bunch of

629
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,078
capabilities today. We are finicky consumers

630
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:47,578
and that's why companies need to be a little bit more agile.

631
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,719
So a little around the business suite, um,

632
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,219
At the core of our strategy is AI,

633
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,729
OK. And we believe that AI has fundamentally

634
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:56,549
changed the world

635
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,920
and will continue to change the world as we move

636
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,009
forward. And yes, you probably find

637
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,088
from every single vendor that's out there talking about

638
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,170
AI saying, yeah, AI, AI, AI, and

639
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,459
that's great. AI on its own

640
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:09,769
is not gonna provide the value. Why? Because

641
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,049
it needs to have real data to operate

642
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,078
off. If you don't have real data

643
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:16,189
and rich data and qualified data, etc.

644
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:17,910
it actually doesn't operate really well.

645
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,779
Now, at SAP we have an

646
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,858
application layer that you've trusted for 53 years,

647
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:25,180
an ERP layer that generates that

648
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,920
trusted data.

649
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,500
And getting access to that trusted data, we

650
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,019
think that's the flywheel effect. So effectively, AI

651
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,529
will read the data, give you some insights, you'll make

652
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,529
some decisions, possibly change the way that the

653
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,818
business operates, possibly change the way that

654
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:39,219
the application is operating.

655
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,750
And as a result, that'll generate new data. That

656
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,078
new data is consumed through AI and continually,

657
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:46,430
that's how you find the flywheel effect in, in place.

658
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:48,969
So, for us at SAP it's all about

659
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,368
uh the application layer, the data,

660
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:52,108
and AI.

661
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,789
And if you look in the industry today, there is nobody

662
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,088
out there that provides all three capabilities,

663
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:59,269
OK? You will have vendors that'll provide

664
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,939
you certainly an application layer.

665
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,509
Certainly, they'll look into the data, and certainly

666
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:04,500
they'll look into AI,

667
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,029
but not all three things together. This is where

668
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:08,068
we see the real value.

669
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,598
OK. Just a little around um

670
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:16,549
the suite. So this introduces the suite.

671
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,160
It's the new uh um Pia

672
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,130
diagram that you'll see on your left-hand side.

673
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,559
At the core of which is uh obviously the

674
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,199
SAP

675
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,279
cloud ERP.

676
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,108
Underneath that is something called the Business Data Cloud.

677
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:30,459
And we'll touch on that, uh, fairly shortly.

678
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,098
Underneath that, you have the business technology platform.

679
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:35,410
Sitting on top of the ERP layer is

680
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,338
obviously the lines of business solutions

681
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,799
with industry-specific capability that

682
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,868
gets delivered with it.

683
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:43,318
On top of that is the artificial intelligence, which

684
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:44,500
is already embedded.

685
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,019
And then the natural language interface is called DL.

686
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,358
All right, which is basically how it's

687
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:50,959
the new UI for SAP.

688
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,439
So as much as you could be on ECC6 with a

689
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,838
GUUI front end, you could also be on S4

690
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:57,838
HANA, which has got a Fiori front end.

691
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,199
But the capability that sits in cloud is is

692
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,180
that your new UI and your starting point

693
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,519
to engage with a piece of software will actually be

694
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,739
through something called JL,

695
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,739
which is your natural language interface.

696
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:10,289
So yes, Juul runs across human resources, sales,

697
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:11,900
procurement, IT sourcing,

698
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:14,519
etc. Pretty much procurement everywhere

699
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,489
inside of cloud ERP.

700
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:20,650
All right. Just a little around the AI strategy.

701
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:23,049
Um, well, you probably have seen this slide

702
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,160
before, but effectively,

703
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,809
everything starts and runs with AI, uh, in a

704
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:27,828
dual interface.

705
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:30,689
So as you talk to it, it's a natural language interface.

706
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,809
So effectively, you would simply type in your natural

707
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:33,670
language query,

708
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:36,289
and it would actually direct you to where your query

709
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:36,989
is operating.

710
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,750
We have also developed some AI capability

711
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,828
which has been embedded in both the lines of

712
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,868
business as well as into the cloud ERP, private

713
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,299
cloud as well as public cloud.

714
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:48,000
And the point is, that when you put a modernized ERP

715
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,348
platform in place, it takes time to actually activate.

716
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,180
So effectively,

717
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:53,469
it is a separate project, but you can activate the

718
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,368
embedded AI capability.

719
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:58,029
Jules takes about 2 to 3 hours to activate

720
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,529
in some of the ERP layer.

721
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,868
Um, you would simply decide on the use cases. There

722
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,338
are 400 of them available to you at the moment

723
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,828
in various lines of business as well as in the cloud

724
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:09,250
ERP. You simply activate those.

725
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,618
We have something called the AI Foundation underneath

726
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:13,739
that. That's part of the BTP stack

727
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,059
Business Technology Platform.

728
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:17,779
And effectively, what that'll allow you to do is it'll

729
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,799
allow you to engage with third-party solutions.

730
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,049
We are not a large language model provider.

731
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:24,578
You can use any one of the external large language

732
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:25,959
providers if that's your choice.

733
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,479
You would simply integrate it using Juul.

734
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,039
You would simply integrate it using the AI Foundation.

735
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,489
So, we have an open standards platform, not

736
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:35,500
really interested in understanding. Um,

737
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,529
how to rewrite large language models. That's

738
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:38,568
not the game we're in.

739
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,318
I thought this would be quite interesting.

740
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,229
We released our Q3 results.

741
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,989
And unfortunately, the, uh,

742
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,739
the sound's not coming through, but anyway,

743
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,630
you can see it's just natural language, asking some

744
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,160
questions. Juul responds accordingly

745
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,318
and gives you some answers.

746
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,650
I thought this was a really neat way of how we

747
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,108
actually went to market with our,

748
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,449
our Q3 results. It's pretty much how

749
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,449
we launched it. It gives you a flavor of

750
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,529
how you would interact with the software itself and I'm not

751
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,880
gonna Uh, so

752
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
just moving on as far as the dual patterns

753
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
are concerned, I'll just build this out quickly.

754
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,118
Basically, it's informational, right? So how do

755
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:37,170
I find something within the system? Uh, so

756
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,828
for example, if I'm looking for credit notes.

757
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,390
Normally in a GUI front end, you would have to know where

758
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,420
the screen is. You would have to navigate through the menu

759
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,430
system to get to where it is that you need

760
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,459
to operate. Within Juul, you're simply asking

761
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:48,818
a question and getting an answer.

762
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,269
That's the navigational one. That's the second one. The first

763
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:52,059
one is around,

764
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,509
for example, if I'm taking customers out

765
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,588
to dinner, I have some compliance issues I

766
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,739
need to deal with. So am I doing a deal with a customer? Is

767
00:26:58,739 --> 00:26:59,949
it a public sector customer?

768
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:01,289
How much money can I spend,

769
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,750
right? At the end of the day, in,

770
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,989
in the past, I would have to get a hold of, uh, I

771
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:08,239
would have to create a ticket, send it off to HR going,

772
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm taking some customers out. This is the circumstance.

773
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,759
This is what's going on. Can you tell me how much am I allowed

774
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,868
to spend? Once I get that information, I

775
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:17,029
send it on to my manager saying, is it part of the budget? Can

776
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:18,150
I spend it? Yes or no?

777
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,739
Manager says yes. If for some

778
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:23,269
unknown reason I go over that spend at nighttime,

779
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,588
I have to pay for the difference. OK. So I wanna be

780
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:27,670
careful about how I do that. Inside

781
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,750
Juulel today, I can take my mobile phone

782
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,348
going, I'm going out to dinner.

783
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,650
I'm spending, there's 10 people. I'm

784
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,598
in Orlando. I'm in, uh,

785
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,140
Las Vegas and I'm going out to dinner with a customer.

786
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:40,598
Uh, how much money can I spend? And it'll come back and tell

787
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:41,439
me straight away.

788
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,799
And if I want to, it'll ask me, it'll say, do you want your

789
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,039
manager's approval? Yes. And it'll auto reroute

790
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,420
to the cust uh to the manager

791
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:49,890
who has to reroute. That saves me weeks

792
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,818
of of time, right?

793
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
We've explained the, uh, navigational transactional

794
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,338
is, uh, for example, I see some,

795
00:27:57,348 --> 00:27:59,299
uh, some credit notes coming through,

796
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:01,598
uh, from a customer or an angry email.

797
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:03,920
OK. So it's gonna say, uh, simple things

798
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,229
like Uh, uh, you,

799
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,400
uh, promised me a delivery. I ordered some stuff. I've

800
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,439
paid for it. You've sent me an invoice for it, but only half

801
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,650
was delivered. What's going on?

802
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,279
Now, in a normal set of circumstances, I would have to

803
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,358
engage with a credit control clerk. I would have to

804
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,598
engage with the sales guy. I'd have to engage with the delivery

805
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,750
person, etc. right throughout the, the

806
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,880
supply chain of selling, well, the supply chain of

807
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,640
delivery. And what will happen with transactional

808
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,680
capabilities is Jewel will actually navigate to all

809
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,759
of those things, pull them all up for you so you can make an

810
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:30,539
informed decision.

811
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,189
And then we'll ask you, do you want me to write the email to apologize

812
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:33,858
to the customer,

813
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,410
or do you wanna send the customer the next order, or what's

814
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,410
the response that you, so it'll actually give you

815
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,479
the conclusion of the, the transaction. Saves

816
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,809
you a significant amount of time.

817
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,368
And then analytically, I think this is probably

818
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:46,650
one of the most advanced capabilities that exist

819
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,368
within the suite

820
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,969
is about being able to ask a question

821
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:50,930
and get an answer.

822
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,029
Typically, we spend a lot of time

823
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:55,809
capturing information into a transaction system.

824
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:58,189
And then trying to extrapolate that, contextualize

825
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:00,269
it, and put it into the hands of decision makers

826
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:02,920
so that they can make decisions effectively as possible.

827
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:05,348
So, we are people that create thousands

828
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,348
of reports and send it to hundreds of people within

829
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:08,828
the business, etc. And again,

830
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,309
we don't manage that landscape. On an AI

831
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:12,729
landscape, what, what is interesting.

832
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,318
As you can simply ask a question. It'll execute

833
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,019
the response,

834
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:18,400
give you an understanding, and you can make a decision

835
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
on it. You can even forward it and collaborate

836
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,459
with other individuals

837
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,759
on the same decision point so that you can deliver on

838
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,880
it. Cause tomorrow, I can ask the same

839
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,180
question and I can get the same answer.

840
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,680
So again, improving the way that you operate within the

841
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
business. So we believe that you will save as much

842
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,180
as 30% operational

843
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,640
value by utilizing something like Juulel within

844
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,239
the suite

845
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,150
at SAP.

846
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,559
OK. Uh, AI agents, and I

847
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,880
know you've probably been to some presentations

848
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,078
on Agentic AI,

849
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,920
but that for us is the next layer up. So effectively,

850
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:49,578
we've created

851
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:52,338
AI agents already sitting

852
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:53,559
inside of the lines of business.

853
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,078
But for us at SAP it's simple enough to say

854
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:56,598
that, look,

855
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,380
you know, we recognize that

856
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:01,180
Uh, decisions that are made within the

857
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,229
organization run across the business. It

858
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:05,299
runs across finance, runs across supply chain,

859
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,469
runs across procurement, runs across all these

860
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:08,098
decision makers.

861
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,469
And as opposed to getting decisions out of each

862
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:11,539
of those individuals,

863
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,269
you can have an AI agentic AI coordinating

864
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,309
with AI agents that already exist.

865
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,719
So you can have something that orchestrates it all,

866
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:21,108
OK. And that's the next layer up from

867
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:22,229
an SAP point of view.

868
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:25,578
So there are plenty of dual agents available. We've got

869
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:27,489
a whole bunch that were recently released

870
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:30,338
as part of the uh the embedded AI capability.

871
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,689
There's a significant amount of them that are available.

872
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,130
You simply have capability to look at

873
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,939
a catalog

874
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,259
and then determine what is available uh

875
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,118
from the catalog.

876
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,880
Inside of the, the suite of solutions as

877
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,920
well, you will also get access to something called dual

878
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,608
Studio.

879
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:47,199
Because we believe at SAP we're not all things to all

880
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,578
men. We'll continue to build embedded

881
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,838
AI capabilities for sure that you

882
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,199
can consume as a customer,

883
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,680
but we won't build everything for all industries and

884
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,759
for all value sets, right, and for all lines of

885
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,838
business. So you get something called Duual

886
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,838
Studio which gives you access. It's part of the

887
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:02,880
BTP stack.

888
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:05,608
Again, effectively using SAP

889
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:07,640
Build, you can go and build your own

890
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,789
natural language queries, OK, within

891
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,400
your system.

892
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,880
So especially if you've customized your system a

893
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,759
little bit, etc.

894
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:16,239
that you take on your own nuances within the business.

895
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,479
So you have the ability to then build your

896
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:21,039
own natural language interface, uh, and queries.

897
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,759
And I mentioned a little earlier, you get the

898
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,640
opportunity to discover, manage, and govern

899
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,000
all of the agents in one place. Whether it was

900
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,029
SAP created,

901
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,160
whether you created it, or whether it was custom-created

902
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,000
by a non uh SAP customer,

903
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:36,680
or excuse me, from a partner's point of view. So,

904
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:38,930
literally, you get the ability to look into,

905
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,479
I'm looking for financial embedded AI

906
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,130
capabilities. What does that look like?

907
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,680
And it'll show you the availability that is applicable,

908
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,759
yes or no. And you can then choose to deploy it

909
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,809
or not. So

910
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,890
certainly, um, uh, something

911
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,479
else that

912
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,009
exists within, uh, some of the agent mining

913
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:57,289
in a, in a solution set called Signalvia,

914
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,519
um, it'll, it'll, um,

915
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:02,630
Juul will help you not only trace agent decision and

916
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,759
action. So in other words,

917
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,469
what are the agents that are deployed,

918
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,059
what needs to be, uh, managed and governed, um,

919
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,199
but also start looking at some of your

920
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,259
business processes and flagging where some

921
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:14,439
of those bottlenecks are, uh, within the solution

922
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,519
area. And then basically monitoring it

923
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,670
and coming up with recommendations on how to optimize

924
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,719
it. So this is AI that's embedded

925
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:23,160
in the actual business process management

926
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,019
technology called Signalvia.

927
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,809
And what we've done at SAP is we not only

928
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:29,250
talk about how customers are consuming it, we're actually

929
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,410
embedding it in our own lifestyle, our

930
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,489
own application, our own, uh, internally

931
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:35,739
at SAP. So we're consuming our own software.

932
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,719
So we talked about AI. We're gonna

933
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,880
talk a little bit about the data, uh, piece

934
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,078
and SAP at the beginning of last

935
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:45,199
year, um, had to make a decision

936
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:47,199
around, uh, the data because what

937
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,400
we were noticing is that a large part of the customers

938
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,439
were moving into the data and extract

939
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,959
extrapolating the data into third-party solutions,

940
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:56,568
trying to build contextualization on the data

941
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,799
and putting analytical solutions and yes, in

942
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,000
some, in some cases, even um AI

943
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,479
capabilities on the front end

944
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,930
and trying to deliver that to, to the businesses,

945
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,799
as providing.

946
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,660
And so we made a decision to fundamentally change

947
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,670
the SAP strategy, which was we built the contextualization

948
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,789
for you. We launched a product called Business

949
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:16,029
Data Cloud, and effectively, that creates

950
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,150
a semantic layer that sits on top of

951
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,680
SAP.

952
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:21,509
So if you're looking to run a query or you're looking to

953
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:23,549
understand anything in terms of either line of

954
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:25,750
business or at the ERP layer, you

955
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,868
work through BDC.

956
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,328
And BDC is a zero copy capability.

957
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,598
So effectively,

958
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,989
on the front end, we've built, uh, on the back end, we've built

959
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,180
the data products for you.

960
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:36,479
There's 200 data products that have been pre-built.

961
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,578
So, in other words, the source to target mapping has

962
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:40,739
already been done for you. And you simply embed

963
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,439
the um uh the data product.

964
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,019
And effectively, what you would do is when you run the query

965
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:45,818
on the front end,

966
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,299
whether it's an analytical query, whether it's

967
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,358
a whether it's an AI query,

968
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,699
etc. it basically understands where the

969
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,019
data resides.

970
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,838
Not only that, we have a relationship with, um,

971
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:58,400
with a company called Data Bricks.

972
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:01,630
Um, which essentially,

973
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:02,670
um,

974
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,328
allows us to actually access third-party data

975
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:06,608
or non-SAP data.

976
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,250
So effectively, what you have now is this capability

977
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,469
in, in BDC to say, well, I'm looking

978
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,610
for, uh, you know, if the customer's using

979
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,809
an HR tool that's outside of SAP, for

980
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:17,849
example, I'm looking for my cost

981
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,769
comparison by employee, for example.

982
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,090
I'm gonna be pulling from my financial system, which

983
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,329
is gonna come through BDC.

984
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,849
And I'm gonna be pulling from uh

985
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,188
uh an external third-party HR product

986
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,469
or solution utilizing uh data

987
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,510
bricks. And I can get a viewpoint on

988
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,829
what's going on within the business. Again, AI

989
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:36,119
is applied on the top of that.

990
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:38,429
And so what we've also then decided to do is

991
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,369
build what we call,

992
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:41,849
um, uh, intelligent

993
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,148
applications. So we're creating an HR

994
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,628
application. We're creating a finance application. We're creating,

995
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,989
uh, a procurement application which basically

996
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,030
fundamentally aggregates all the data for you.

997
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,489
Again, we're not copying the data into

998
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,050
a third-party solution.

999
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,628
So in an AWS environment, for example,

1000
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,949
when you're sitting in a hyperscale, we're not lifting and shifting

1001
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:00,929
the transaction data

1002
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,668
and replicating it in an enterprise data warehouse.

1003
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:06,289
What BDC also does is it gives you access

1004
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,369
to your data warehouse already BW that's

1005
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:10,510
already deployed. So I know 2033

1006
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:12,849
is when BW comes to an end from a support point

1007
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,978
of view. What this does is it sees BW

1008
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:16,030
as another data source

1009
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,530
and will aggregate or do zero copy data

1010
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,949
as you need it. So if you've got all your SLTs

1011
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,329
which have been programmed into a BW environment, you

1012
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,329
can continue to use it and extend the lifespan

1013
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,789
of the work that's already been done.

1014
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,878
All right. And a little around the customer journey.

1015
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,719
So some customers are sitting on-premise,

1016
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,159
ECC6. Some customers are sitting with

1017
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,360
a, a certified uh S4

1018
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,208
implementation uh on-premise.

1019
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,559
Some customers have taken that implementation

1020
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,340
and gone to a hyperscale as well.

1021
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,039
Um, at the end of the day, uh, it doesn't matter

1022
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,739
where your journey begins. Um,

1023
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,719
one thing that SAP is synonymous

1024
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,188
with is at the beginning of each year,

1025
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,800
we change the naming conventions for some of the

1026
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,869
products and solutions.

1027
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,139
Apologies for that, but that's just the way it is.

1028
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:00,789
Um, as it is today, uh, the business

1029
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,449
suite is a marketing terminology.

1030
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:04,949
And really what you need to understand is the journey that

1031
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:06,978
you're gonna follow. All right. So effectively,

1032
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,309
there are two journeys. There's one called Rise and one

1033
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:10,019
called Grow.

1034
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,909
The Rise journey is for existing customers

1035
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,628
on-premise that are moving to the cloud.

1036
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,070
All right. And the grow environment is a green field

1037
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,110
implementation that typically is a customer who is

1038
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,389
a non-SAP customer.

1039
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:22,829
And we have a lot of those net new customers that come on

1040
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:23,688
board every year.

1041
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,019
It doesn't matter what your ERP layer is, it's a

1042
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,469
simple green field implementation.

1043
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,438
And the migration path for a Ryse

1044
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,699
customer is either brownfield,

1045
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,840
um, or a brownfield and a green field combination.

1046
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,320
Um, and it could be an on-premise, excuse

1047
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,869
me, it could be a private cloud

1048
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,269
or a public cloud environment. We have some hybrid

1049
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:42,510
customers out there that have a,

1050
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,918
for example, a private cloud environment for the head

1051
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,179
office and some of the satellite,

1052
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,639
um, environments that they're operating in. So, for

1053
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,829
example, some of the mining companies, they got some public cloud

1054
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:51,519
deployments,

1055
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,438
all right, that have been deployed. So we do get that hybrid

1056
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:55,340
environment as well.

1057
00:36:56,128 --> 00:36:58,219
But in essence, for a Greenfield customer,

1058
00:36:58,418 --> 00:36:59,769
uh, the starting point is,

1059
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,059
obviously, you have any ERP that's in

1060
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:04,458
place, Greenfield ERP transformation

1061
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,438
into the suite.

1062
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,260
And then, uh, for a private cloud customer,

1063
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,208
typically, you have ECC6

1064
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,659
with some of the legacy modules that sit around

1065
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:14,699
it. And in order to get to the suite,

1066
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,978
typically, the first step would be, well, we lift

1067
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,059
and shift into a modernized ERP platform, which

1068
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:19,668
is S4 HANA.

1069
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,708
The second piece of it is we, uh, we then

1070
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,648
move obviously the legacy modules

1071
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:26,309
into the private cloud environment

1072
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,929
so that you have a, a managed service environment

1073
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:31,030
that gets delivered. So SAP becomes that

1074
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:33,489
single throat to choke for a customer who's

1075
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:34,148
looking for

1076
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:36,809
compliance and certification around all of the ERP

1077
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,389
layer, including the lines of business.

1078
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:41,349
The next layer up is, is that you would look at

1079
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,349
taking some of those legacy modules and putting

1080
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:45,349
them onto a public cloud environment. So for

1081
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,559
example, BW would get into BDP

1082
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,579
APO would be getting into IBP.

1083
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,300
Concur and HCM into success

1084
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,829
factors.

1085
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,280
OK, so that you end up with a combination of private

1086
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,148
and public cloud.

1087
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,570
And ultimately, at the end of the day, we look at it from

1088
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,599
a suite point of view. Your target end state

1089
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,090
could be everything in public cloud.

1090
00:38:03,478 --> 00:38:05,780
It could be someone in private cloud and a combination

1091
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,478
of both.

1092
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,059
But ultimately, that's the journey that you would follow.

1093
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,269
OK. And then

1094
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:12,929
of course

1095
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:15,168
every journey that every customer is on.

1096
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:18,099
Um, is a difficult one. All right.

1097
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:18,780
And so,

1098
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,099
as a result, it's complex. And

1099
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,378
so what we've done at SAP

1100
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,019
is we provide a framework,

1101
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,500
an integrated tool chain, plus the skill

1102
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,458
set to help you understand how you get there.

1103
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,898
OK. So we will actually map the roadmap for

1104
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:33,019
you. And that's broken down into obviously

1105
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,909
those three areas, which I will move on.

1106
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:38,188
The third, uh, uh, the framework itself is

1107
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:40,188
literally um a

1108
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:40,800
uh

1109
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,878
A a SAP methodology that gets

1110
00:38:43,878 --> 00:38:45,958
delivered at every single um gate

1111
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:46,840
that you understand

1112
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:49,398
from the engagement to the delivery of the solution

1113
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:51,958
area, you would understand the roles and responsibilities

1114
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:52,679
of SAP,

1115
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,250
the roles and responsibility of you as the customer,

1116
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,438
as well as your partners. You get something called

1117
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,519
the cloud adoption framework, which gets

1118
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,059
delivered

1119
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,010
where basically you get to understand the visible

1120
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,659
uh steps to actually move to cloud.

1121
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,349
The second piece of it is you will get an integrated tool

1122
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,369
chain. OK. And the integrated tool chain is

1123
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:09,909
part of the

1124
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:12,378
procurement process that you would go through with SAP.

1125
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,949
But effectively, there's an integrated

1126
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,550
technology which helps you with your transformation. And I'll,

1127
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,869
I'll explain that shortly.

1128
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:21,280
And then finally, you get expert guidance, right?

1129
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:22,519
Not only from SAP

1130
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:25,320
but we have a bunch of partners out there that have gone through certified

1131
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,269
training. I

1132
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,539
wanna touch on the Clean Core a little bit, um,

1133
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,099
because it is an important part of the journey that you're on,

1134
00:39:33,148 --> 00:39:35,219
right? So what is Clean Core? It's essentially,

1135
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,570
most customers, what they've done is take an ERP,

1136
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,228
uh, in ECC6, for example, and they've

1137
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,559
customized it to the Yin-Yang.

1138
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:43,309
So they've looked at the business process.

1139
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:45,668
The original implementation went, go to an SI,

1140
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,168
look at the business process I have,

1141
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:49,708
look at what's standard with SAP and modify it

1142
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,188
as much as you can, OK, in order to suit the business

1143
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,418
process. So what you end up with is customers

1144
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:56,739
in some customer cases, up to half a million

1145
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,250
Z code changes within an application

1146
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,570
layer. Now, to move that into a cloud

1147
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,699
environment, and that also hinders things like upgrades,

1148
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,800
etc. to move that into a cloud environment

1149
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:08,059
is a real challenge. OK. So, how

1150
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:08,699
do you deal with it?

1151
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,179
Uh, the idea is, is that you wanna get it as

1152
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,000
standard as possible

1153
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:14,418
and decide what is nuanced for the business

1154
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:15,090
that you need.

1155
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,418
So typically, you, you, you, uh, in a brownfield

1156
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,418
implementation, you would look at it and say, how do I

1157
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,340
get the core clean?

1158
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
All right. And the second piece of it is how do I keep it

1159
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,739
clean. All right.

1160
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,199
And you have two options, um, in a,

1161
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,519
in a, in a green field implementation which is

1162
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,699
grow, you simply have to keep the core clean,

1163
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,840
uh, essentially.

1164
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:35,559
But you have two options. You either create custom

1165
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,559
code. And you build it in a public cloud

1166
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,599
server called BTP which sits next to

1167
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,929
your private cloud environment.

1168
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,320
So all your functional calls, etc. happen on

1169
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,519
the public cloud server, which is fine, no

1170
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,760
issue. If there's a communication protocol

1171
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,878
issue between the two servers, you can actually build

1172
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,929
it on stack. So we have it off-stack as well as

1173
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:52,559
on-Stack.

1174
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,110
Off-Stack being on a BTP environment.

1175
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,559
And typically, those things are turned around in a few weeks.

1176
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,938
So it's not difficult to do.

1177
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,599
Um, so essentially part of the, the

1178
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,599
Clean core methodology is looking at

1179
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,719
it going, what, what needs to be modified, what

1180
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,800
needs to be made S4 ready? What are

1181
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,079
some of the code that we can get rid of? Cause up to 40%

1182
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,119
of the code that's being deployed, cause nobody

1183
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:12,820
deletes anything,

1184
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,559
you can simply toss because you're not using, right?

1185
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,659
And we would help you through that process.

1186
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,119
And certainly there's some white papers out there which show

1187
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,340
customers, listen, this is how you would approach

1188
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:24,418
uh uh a cleaner core environment.

1189
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:27,059
Some customers do it upfront. So before they

1190
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,300
move through the transformation

1191
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:30,699
to S4, some customers do it post the facts, so

1192
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,280
they do a

1193
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,898
green field implementation and then they start moving data

1194
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:35,938
across and start figuring it out from that point

1195
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:37,300
of view. It makes it more difficult,

1196
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,780
certainly, but certainly palatable. Um, so

1197
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,418
either or,

1198
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,478
uh, whichever works for you as a customer.

1199
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:45,889
Uh, now we move into the, the tool chain

1200
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:46,840
itself, um,

1201
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,978
the integrated tool chain. And with that,

1202
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,688
uh, some of the integrated tool chain that you will get

1203
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:53,728
access to is, uh, a business

1204
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:54,789
process mining solution,

1205
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:56,829
uh, which deals with processes,

1206
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,269
applications, and people.

1207
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:00,820
Um, so it binds those three concepts together.

1208
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,949
Um, so for example, in the process engine, you

1209
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:03,820
have Signnavia,

1210
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:06,309
which is a business process management engine. It'll

1211
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:08,510
tell you what is best in class in terms of the business

1212
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,780
process, trying to keep it as standard as possible.

1213
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,309
It'll then go down into your, uh, business

1214
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:15,590
processes that you're already using. So it'll look

1215
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,628
through an insights engine. It'll show you where the

1216
00:42:17,628 --> 00:42:20,019
gaps are in the business process. It'll

1217
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:21,269
map it back to the standards.

1218
00:42:21,728 --> 00:42:23,800
You have a collaboration engine which allows you to

1219
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
collaborate with everybody in the business process and

1220
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,840
you can sit there and go, well, tell me what it is you'd

1221
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,619
like to see.

1222
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,079
And then you can build it inside of a framework and

1223
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,079
you can test and run some data against it and if

1224
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,280
you like it, you can deploy it.

1225
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,898
All right. On the

1226
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:37,550
application side,

1227
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:40,159
Lean IX is the enterprise architecture tool. So

1228
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,260
that basically allows you to document

1229
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,909
all of the software applications that you're running, all

1230
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:47,000
the managed services environments that you're up and running,

1231
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,320
all the network connectivity and protocols that you're

1232
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,648
running, and it's fully integrated into Signnavia.

1233
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,639
So when you make a business process change, for example,

1234
00:42:54,918 --> 00:42:57,000
you would immediately see what is impacted within

1235
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,079
the enterprise architecture layer within the

1236
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,978
business. All right. Why is that important?

1237
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:03,438
Cause we spoke about it at the, at the beginning

1238
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:05,599
where there's this wedge developing between business

1239
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,280
and IT

1240
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,000
because now what happens is business says, oh, I wanna do this

1241
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,050
merger and acquisition. I wanna go ahead and do this. I

1242
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,639
wanna buy this. I wanna send this new product to market, etc.

1243
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,000
You now have the capability as IT to look into

1244
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,519
it and go,

1245
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:19,590
Mr. CFO, you know that, uh,

1246
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,590
solution you were asking for. We have to

1247
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:23,958
downscale this, we have to purchase that. We have to do

1248
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:26,059
all these, um, upscale the servers,

1249
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,289
environments, etc. etc.

1250
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,889
It's gonna cost 5 months' worth of, uh, management

1251
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:32,010
time and about $50 million. Do you wanna do it? Yes

1252
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,250
or no? And then there's an informed

1253
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,289
decision. But again, it's a collaboration that

1254
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:38,289
happens between business and IT and we say it's

1255
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,489
the handshake between the two.

1256
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:41,398
Then you look at the people, right?

1257
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,599
So when, as and when you get into

1258
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:45,918
innovation, typically what ends up happening is when you

1259
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:47,949
roll out a new innovation, we train everybody.

1260
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:50,119
Everybody's thumbs up. I'm good with the

1261
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:52,199
training. I go home, I have a great night, I

1262
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,030
come back tomorrow and I look at the screen and I go,

1263
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,878
what happened and where was I and what am I doing?

1264
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,590
And so there's this uh tool set. Part of the

1265
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,398
integrated tool chain is a product called WalkM,

1266
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,219
which basically will show you through a workflow

1267
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:06,349
application saying this is where you were before, this is how you

1268
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:08,349
process, this is where you are now, and this is how you need to

1269
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:08,929
move forward.

1270
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,789
So it stops me having to raise a ticket. Please

1271
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:13,989
get somebody out here so I can get some more

1272
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,228
training. Um, and so I get a better

1273
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:17,780
understanding of what's going on. Similarly,

1274
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,148
from a management point of view, you have a dashboard that

1275
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:22,260
tells you how many people within the business process

1276
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,340
that you've just rolled out are consuming and

1277
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,668
using the new business process.

1278
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:28,699
So if there there's nobody using it, your business

1279
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,719
is not adopting the change, we can then go back

1280
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,918
into the, the team and nominate people

1281
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:35,000
and go, what's the issue? How do we

1282
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,349
fix it? All right. And part of that

1283
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,530
integrated tool chain is something called automated testing.

1284
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,269
So every single enhancement

1285
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,590
that you get delivered either from SAP or you

1286
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,909
build yourself, you're gonna have to run through a testing protocol

1287
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:46,668
and management.

1288
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,260
And the way to do that, um, in

1289
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,148
today's world is to do it through an automation,

1290
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:53,708
which basically gives you, uh, where's the risk,

1291
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:55,869
risky code, where's the problematic

1292
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,389
data that I'm gonna be accessing.

1293
00:44:57,809 --> 00:44:59,719
Etc. So that that's what you focus on.

1294
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:02,139
It'll save you up to about 90% of the time

1295
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:04,579
that's, that's in uh in testing

1296
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,699
environment. What does that mean? That means I can

1297
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,599
deliver enhancements faster to the business

1298
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:10,099
on a more rapid pace.

1299
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:14,699
All right. And then underlying uh

1300
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:17,239
the business data cloud, uh under there is the business

1301
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:17,878
technology platform.

1302
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,378
And that's part of the integrated tool chain, right? And

1303
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:21,619
you will get access to it.

1304
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,099
Effectively, the business technology platform is an

1305
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,208
aggregate bunch of technologies, of

1306
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,418
course. The first and primary piece

1307
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:30,800
of that is the integration suite, which sits in the middle.

1308
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,378
And so when you're moving to cloud, you're gonna have to integrate

1309
00:45:33,378 --> 00:45:35,800
cloud to on-premise, cloud to cloud applications, etc.

1310
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:37,300
right? So that's not gonna change.

1311
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,909
And typically you would need to have a framework that

1312
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:41,938
allows you to basically manage that environment as

1313
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:43,659
you move forward. On the left-hand side,

1314
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,099
application development and automation. So if you're building

1315
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:48,340
something, you're extending something, building

1316
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,239
extensibility within the business itself,

1317
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:53,099
or you're building AI or dual capability,

1318
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:54,159
you're gonna build it

1319
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,559
inside of BTP. This is where it's housed.

1320
00:45:56,938 --> 00:45:58,978
You have the capability to run full ABA

1321
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,579
code, so professional code, you can have limited

1322
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:03,820
code or you can have no code development, all sitting

1323
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,699
within BTP.

1324
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:07,369
So if you choose to have no code development,

1325
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:09,289
it's simply dragging and dropping and running

1326
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:11,188
specific simple applications

1327
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,849
on mobile devices, for example, and then we get a variance

1328
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:14,500
in between.

1329
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:17,860
All right. And on the right-hand side, we talk about data and analysis.

1330
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,449
Data means how do I manage my data in the cloud.

1331
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:23,309
So it's the database, the integration framework,

1332
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:24,619
um, that sits with it.

1333
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:27,300
And then certainly the analytical tools. So analytics

1334
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,329
cloud, for example,

1335
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,929
and then underneath that is the artificial intelligence

1336
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:31,780
that all sits

1337
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,000
within the BTP stack. OK.

1338
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,418
And so as a result, customers, as

1339
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,188
they purchase,

1340
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:38,760
would, would consume that.

1341
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:41,570
And in summary, I think this will be

1342
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:43,050
how we bring it all together.

1343
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:45,989
So, to me, there is, and to SAP

1344
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:47,989
there is a transformation program to

1345
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:49,739
go through and an innovation program.

1346
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,070
And what we often talk to our customer about is

1347
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,070
we talk to them about perpetual innovation in

1348
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,458
a world in a backdrop that we painted at the outset,

1349
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,659
which is this world that we're operating in,

1350
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,429
which is exposing us to consistent change.

1351
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,510
How do I go through that? So a customer that's sitting

1352
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,250
on-premise.

1353
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,369
Um, or an on-premise solution.

1354
00:47:06,648 --> 00:47:09,010
Let's assume that they need to move through to cloud,

1355
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:09,809
cloud ERP.

1356
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:12,489
Well, absolutely, they'll move through cloud ERP. The

1357
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:14,570
first part of which is I'll need

1358
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,510
to fix my data.

1359
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:16,978
I'll need to look at the data,

1360
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:19,750
what's managed, what's governed, what's clean, what's unmanaged,

1361
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,320
uh, what's deduplicated, what needs to be, uh,

1362
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:24,750
what's missing in terms of the data. Data integrity.

1363
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:27,469
Is the fundamental science or fundamental basis

1364
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,469
of how you're gonna consume

1365
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:31,469
information within the business, right? So, and

1366
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:34,090
we spend a lot of time, effort, and money taking

1367
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:36,148
information out of the transaction system,

1368
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,570
loading it into a warehouse, and then putting analytical

1369
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,289
tools on the front end for that information.

1370
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:42,989
But you have to deal with the data. Is it S4

1371
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:44,570
ready? Is it in memory, capable,

1372
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,110
um, etc. right? So, yes, you

1373
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,188
have to have a, a data quality management

1374
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:49,969
program in place

1375
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:52,469
because that then becomes the fundamental basis of how

1376
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,809
you run artificial intelligence within your

1377
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:56,820
organization. The second piece is around

1378
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,938
the cleaner core approach. We spoke a little bit about

1379
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:01,159
that. How do I get rid of the code that's

1380
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:03,519
there? Um, because the idea is

1381
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,820
in the past when you bought an on-premise piece

1382
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,000
of software, as I mentioned, you would customize

1383
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,148
the yin-yang out of it

1384
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,500
to suit the business process. That's been turned on its

1385
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,829
head. Today, we want you to run as

1386
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,938
standard as possible and the nuances

1387
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:18,429
of your organization, you would build inside a BTP

1388
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,728
through the SAP build environment,

1389
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:23,188
OK? Or you build it external

1390
00:48:23,188 --> 00:48:25,188
outside of the core. And the idea is, is that you can

1391
00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:27,369
then upgrade your systems and keep upgraded

1392
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,829
as new, uh, enhancements are released.

1393
00:48:30,188 --> 00:48:32,188
To give you an example, we have a customer who

1394
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:33,989
can upgrade their system and did so.

1395
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,369
They switched off their system at 6 o'clock on a

1396
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:39,090
Friday night and they were back up 14 minutes later.

1397
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,409
All right, because they had a clean core environment.

1398
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,188
And I'd love to see some customers. Some customers take

1399
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:46,610
5 months to upgrade. Some customers just don't bother.

1400
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,139
OK. Because it's too uh uh to,

1401
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:51,378
to unpack that uh uh is a real

1402
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:53,389
issue. So how do you get a, a

1403
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,119
cleaner core?

1404
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:56,989
And then, um, as you do that, you would

1405
00:48:56,989 --> 00:48:58,059
then roll out BTP

1406
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:00,469
underneath, um, uh, the solution

1407
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:02,750
area which deals with integration and data management

1408
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,389
to begin with.

1409
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,128
And at a later stage, we'll deal with s,

1410
00:49:06,628 --> 00:49:09,300
planning, obviously, financial planning and forecasting,

1411
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,599
and then the business data cloud, which is then

1412
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,208
part of the BTP stack as well.

1413
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:16,829
We talked about the integrated tool chain, so the business

1414
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:17,769
process management engine

1415
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,590
and the enterprise architecture. You would roll out Signnavia,

1416
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,059
you would roll out LeanIX.

1417
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:24,378
You would roll out WalkMe, and then the

1418
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,550
development or the uh testing tool is Tricentis,

1419
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,869
which is a third-bo tool,

1420
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:30,659
but nevertheless, one that we love using, um,

1421
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,550
because it integrates directly into Calm.

1422
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,260
Uh, with that, you will also get capabilities

1423
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,418
to run AI application accelerators, some

1424
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:39,449
that are built in Signnavia that we discussed,

1425
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,059
and some that are built inside of BTP as well.

1426
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:43,800
So the idea is to help you

1427
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,780
transform as fast as possible, um,

1428
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,519
within boundaries, of course.

1429
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:51,000
And with that, you would get the methodology that

1430
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,039
goes with it. So that's the cloud adoption framework

1431
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,119
as well as the SAP

1432
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,639
methodology. And I, I mentioned earlier that

1433
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:57,820
the cloud adoption framework

1434
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,059
spells out the roles and responsibility

1435
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,148
of you, the partner, or partners,

1436
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:06,179
as well as SAP in every stage of the implementation.

1437
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,800
And then finally, that sits on top of um

1438
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,699
SAP application life cycle Manager.

1439
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,599
And for those of you that don't know,

1440
00:50:13,168 --> 00:50:15,418
uh calm as I call it, just keep calm.

1441
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,030
Cloud application life cycle manager

1442
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:20,409
effectively is um pretty much

1443
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:21,699
what IT would use to

1444
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,289
figure out where there are challenges within the

1445
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:26,329
existing um framework of the business. So

1446
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:26,918
for example,

1447
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,329
is there a problem with one of the processes? Is there a

1448
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,849
problem with one of the, the data sets not integrating

1449
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:33,909
properly? Is there a problem with some of the integration,

1450
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:34,820
for example,

1451
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:37,269
um, and basically would show you where those problems

1452
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,050
are so that IT can then focus on,

1453
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,449
on where that challenge is.

1454
00:50:40,978 --> 00:50:43,168
Once you've got to this point, a modernized ERP

1455
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,500
platform, you can activate JO.

1456
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:47,320
Uh, JOL's capable, um, inside of

1457
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:51,469
I think, uh, uh, modernized ERP

1458
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:52,369
platform for sure.

1459
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,050
Um,

1460
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,510
both at the ERP layer as well as the lines of

1461
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,739
business as you move on.

1462
00:50:58,228 --> 00:51:00,668
But then we start talking about innovation, right? So

1463
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:02,269
how does the business innovate?

1464
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:04,659
Well, how do we create extensibility? How

1465
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:05,938
do we create automation?

1466
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:08,429
How do we figure out on changes to the business

1467
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:09,128
process, for example,

1468
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:11,809
how do we automate testing? How do we, uh,

1469
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:14,260
deliver something like business data cloud into the

1470
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,389
organization, delivering artificial intelligence.

1471
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:18,809
And I use this kind of analogy here

1472
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,809
that never ends, right? Innovation never

1473
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:22,849
ends. We're in a world where innovation

1474
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:24,929
has to be perpetual in order to provide

1475
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,090
value because the position keeps changing.

1476
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:29,610
And as an organization, unless you have a captive

1477
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,050
audience that has no choice but to buy your solutions,

1478
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,369
the fact of the matter is we obviously

1479
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:36,409
need to still keep growing our businesses and we

1480
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:37,570
have to do more with less.

1481
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:40,239
And the only way to continually doing that is to

1482
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,429
make sure that you utilize the solution areas, right?

1483
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,760
So the integrated tool chain will remain

1484
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,909
within the business and gets continued to be

1485
00:51:46,909 --> 00:51:47,639
used. AI

1486
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,360
on the business process engine will show you where

1487
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,389
there are still further bottlenecks that start

1488
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:54,438
developing within the business. And over time, you

1489
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:56,039
get that capability to drive.

1490
00:51:56,969 --> 00:51:59,079
All right. And then finally, you start talking about things like

1491
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:01,188
artificial intelligence, the rollout of DL,

1492
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,199
augmented analytics, for example,

1493
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,918
how do you automate things and how do you build extensions

1494
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:08,050
on inside of BTP.

1495
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,840
Now, any organization that's going through a, a

1496
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,809
modern ERP

1497
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,679
deployment, you can lift and shift, move to an on-premise

1498
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:16,849
world, and then from an on-premise single instance

1499
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,320
S forward uh harness system,

1500
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,378
then move into a, a cloud application,

1501
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:23,869
look at a hyperscalar, etc. The

1502
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:25,219
journey is endless.

1503
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:27,878
From an SAP point of view, we would help you define

1504
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:28,840
what that looks like.

1505
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,679
So we would spend time with your organization, first

1506
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:33,760
figuring out where your innovation strategy is

1507
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,550
and what your culture within your business is.

1508
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,958
The second piece about it is, is trying to figure

1509
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,099
out what your end state looks like. So what is your,

1510
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:42,719
what's your operating model now and versus

1511
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:44,530
what the operating model is in the cloud

1512
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:47,000
as it is. The third piece of it is how

1513
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,059
we give you something called platform assurance.

1514
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:51,724
Because when you take your infrastructure and you give it to SAP,

1515
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:55,644
you wanna know that it's 99.7% to 99.999%

1516
00:52:55,644 --> 00:52:56,204
uptime.

1517
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:59,844
That there's no challenges with that. We manage 150,000

1518
00:52:59,853 --> 00:53:01,465
SAP systems around the world

1519
00:53:01,724 --> 00:53:03,885
using the hyperscales to do it. OK. So

1520
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:04,405
we have

1521
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:07,063
a huge infrastructure managed, um,

1522
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:09,175
managed services environment within the SAP.

1523
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,239
So we'll look at those three things

1524
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,739
and then we will look at innovation within your business

1525
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:16,019
and we will then define what your end-state target

1526
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:18,059
needs to look like across the journeys

1527
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:18,898
that we discussed.

1528
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,458
So what does your end-state look like? Where, what is your first

1529
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,418
step in the journey? What does that look like, etc.

1530
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:25,829
That will then facilitate the business case,

1531
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:27,938
which then would go off to the organization

1532
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,079
and then we would help you deliver on that.

1533
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:31,969
And that would be the journey from SAP.

1534
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:34,719
Do we have any questions?

1535
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,000
Well, thank you very much. I hope that uh you enjoyed

1536
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,340
the session and please enjoy the rest of the day. Thank

1537
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:43,559
you.
