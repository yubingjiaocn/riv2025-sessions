1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,000
- Hello everyone, welcome.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,710
Thanks so much for joining us.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,170
It's great to see everyone here.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,549
Hope re:Invent is going
really well for all of you.

5
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:14,220
The silent session format
is a little bit interesting

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,730
but we're not able to take
questions from the audience

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,650
but we will be around at the end.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,900
So, definitely stick around and we'll have

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,460
a great discussion here today.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,560
I'm Andrew Keating with LogicMonitor.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,240
I lead product marketing there.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm joined by two incredible panelists

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,640
and my goal is to actually talk

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,330
as little as possible and
get these guys to be talking

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,550
because they and their organizations

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,390
are really leaders in
this AI era that we're in.

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,730
And so, we've got some questions

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,610
and some great conversation
teed up for you all

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,990
but really our goal here is
to really unpack Agentic AIOps

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,480
and discuss you know,
how LogicMonitor partners

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,060
with organizations like
Worldwide Technology

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,290
and NTT Data and really hear
from leaders in this space

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,840
who are you know, paving the way

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,750
for this kind of AI era
that we're in today.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,260
So, I'm joined by Abhi
Lakhani from NTT Data.

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,330
He's the VP of Go-To-Market

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,580
for Cloud and Security in Americas

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,610
and Mike Cervasio who's
the global practice manager

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,983
for AIOps at Worldwide Technology.

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,920
So, we are gonna talk a little bit

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,800
about some road map items
on the LogicMonitor side.

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,920
If that comes up, you know
the usual disclaimers apply.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,630
I think everybody's familiar with,

34
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,153
you know, forward looking
statements and all that.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,580
So, our agenda today,

36
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,980
I'm gonna talk again,
as briefly as possible

37
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,650
to give you a little bit of
an orientation on LogicMonitor

38
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,310
and our point of view
around Agentic AIOps.

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,650
We're gonna talk about Agentic AI

40
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,020
and it's possibilities and observability

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,890
and then, you know,

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,120
we're gonna spend most of the time

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,130
with the discussion with these leaders

44
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,720
and talking about kind of,

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,946
how they see the future unfolding,

46
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:58,410
the path to autonomous IT

47
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,320
that really every
organization is on these days.

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,270
We will have, like I said,

49
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,640
plenty of time for questions at the end

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,670
so feel free to grab us
as the session wraps up.

51
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,060
We'll also have the opportunity
to continue the conversation

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,090
at the LogicMonitor booth at
the Worldwide Technology booth.

53
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,633
So, plenty of opportunity
for you all to get engaged.

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,430
Again, I'm Andrew, I lead
product marketing at LogicMonitor

55
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,563
joined by Abhi and Mike.

56
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,090
So, about LogicMonitor, in case
you're not familiar with us,

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,950
we've been around since 2007.

58
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,837
We're fully SAS Native
platform hosted on AWS.

59
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:39,240
We have over 100,000 software
users on our platform.

60
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,450
We're monitoring over
5 million devices a day

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,170
and collecting around
1.5 trillion metrics.

62
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,250
We have a bit over 1,000
employees globally.

63
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,610
We're placed in the Gardner
Magic quadrant as a challenger.

64
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,060
We've received a number of
customer awards and accolades.

65
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,920
We're really positioning ourselves

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,920
as a customer friendly option
for AI first observability.

67
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,840
We had some exciting news yesterday

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,803
and I encourage you all to look up

69
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:11,130
the announcement and the press release.

70
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,317
We have acquired Catchpoint

71
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:17,430
and Catchpoint is a leader in
digital experience monitoring,

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,320
internet performance monitoring.

73
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,890
They have over 3,000
points of presence globally

74
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,750
to monitor internet performance

75
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,270
and so bringing them
together with LogicMonitor,

76
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,803
and our strengths in
infrastructure monitoring

77
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:33,000
and observability, across
hybrid environments

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,990
together with Catchpoint's
strengths in IPM and DEM

79
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,060
really gives us the most comprehensive

80
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,160
observability platform to show

81
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,620
the full experience from user to code.

82
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,450
So, we announced this yesterday

83
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,300
but we do have Catchpoint
team members at our booth

84
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,000
so they're able to give
a demo of their platform.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,190
It's really day one for us.

86
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,320
Actually day two but everyday is day one

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,320
in the Amazon frame of reference.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,470
So, we're super excited to
bring the platform together

89
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,500
to create this comprehensive
observability platform.

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,470
The comprehensive data set
will be incredible for AIOps

91
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,470
and Agentic AI and we're
gonna talk more about that

92
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,313
throughout the course
of the session today.

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,013
- Can I just add one thing?

94
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:16,976
- Please, yeah.

95
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:20,190
- So, this is important with
all the internet outages

96
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,870
we've seen recently.

97
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,460
Unfortunately a three letter
acronym today that we hear,

98
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,230
Asure, Cloudflare, these are
gonna continue to happen.

99
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,240
Mostly due to changes and other things

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,750
but you need something to monitor,

101
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,150
give you the health status
of things you rely on

102
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,970
but don't necessarily own to understand

103
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,170
where the fault domain is.

104
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,850
- Yeah, it's a great point, Mike

105
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,590
and one thing about Catchpoint

106
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,990
for those of you who follow the space.

107
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,600
I mean, they've been
monitoring internet performance

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,610
for quite some time.

109
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,970
They actually had about 15 minutes,

110
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,120
they detected the most recent AWS outage,

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,510
a month or so ago, they
detected it 15 minutes prior

112
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,940
to anything being reported from AWS

113
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,160
because they have their own global network

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,410
that sits outside the hyperscalers

115
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,570
and that's really crucial when

116
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,110
we're doing so much of everything on AWS

117
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,360
and actually other hyperscalers as well.

118
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,193
- Sure.

119
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,026
- But, to be able to sort of understand

120
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:23,400
internet performance when
so much is in the cloud

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,573
is really critical.

122
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,540
So, you know a few trends that we see

123
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,220
and then we'll get to the questions

124
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,290
and discussion some more.

125
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,210
Observability and GenAI

126
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,760
and Agentic AI are really converging.

127
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,610
This is giving IT teams
not only the visibility

128
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,520
that observability
provides but the contacts,

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,610
the automated intelligence
and it's really crucial

130
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,650
to bring together that telemetry data,

131
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,140
the contextual knowledge in the ITSM,

132
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,110
in the knowledge base, and
also now bring in things

133
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,880
like internet performance data,

134
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,890
digital experience synthetics.

135
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,380
Bringing all that together provides us

136
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,290
really rich data set for AI

137
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,430
and with the rise of
Agentic AI for IT Ops,

138
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,300
you know, IT Ops is really
one of the best use cases

139
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,910
for letting loose AI agents, right?

140
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,520
And having an agent that performs

141
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,320
a lot of the functions that, you know,

142
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,540
in the past a human
might have to go and do

143
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,330
and you can orchestrate
agents to do things

144
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,280
like check the database performance,

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,930
check the network performance,

146
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,087
look at what's going on in the ITSM.

147
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:31,380
And so, there's really
this rise of Agentic AI

148
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,940
for IT Ops.

149
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,280
And this also leads to the shift

150
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
from just being concerned about visibility

151
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,530
and understanding, like what
is going on in the environment

152
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,020
to actually being able to take action

153
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,620
and ideally to be proactive
and to prevent incidents

154
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,930
before, before they would even happen

155
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,663
or impact end users or the business.

156
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,140
We see a few kind of value drivers

157
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,237
for Agentic AIOps

158
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:59,310
and these are pretty classic,

159
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,500
you know, aligning to the business.

160
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,710
First and foremost, improving
operational efficiency.

161
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,840
So, there's a world in which, you know,

162
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,290
you can't throw enough
human IT operations,

163
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,670
people at the problem.

164
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,930
You have to actually incorporate
and orchestrate AI agents

165
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,770
alongside humans in IT
Ops in order to achieve

166
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,090
efficiency gains.

167
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,730
It's also about kind of
reducing costs, right?

168
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,990
And for some organizations

169
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,910
that may mean shifting roles.

170
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,550
That may mean taking you know, fewer L1s

171
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,140
and we're gonna talk a
little bit more about that.

172
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,350
I'd love to hear you guys's
perspectives on that.

173
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,260
Yeah, boosting the productivity of the L1s

174
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,300
and others in IT operations

175
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,990
and ultimately ensuring that
the business is performing

176
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,350
and really you know, up time, MTTR,

177
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,910
keeping services running.

178
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,460
That's all in service
of our business goals

179
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,400
whatever industry, whatever
organization you're in.

180
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,650
It's really about turning IT efficiency

181
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,453
into measurable business growth.

182
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,990
So, that's enough talking from me.

183
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,090
I wanna turn to you guys

184
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,400
and first and foremost,
I mean LogicMonitor

185
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,950
has strong partnerships with
both your organizations,

186
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,922
with many other organizations.

187
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,970
I could talk about what we're doing

188
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,550
but I would rather hear
from, from both of you

189
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,200
around how we're working together

190
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,880
and so Mike, maybe we'll start with you

191
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
and then Abhi, would love to hear kind of

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
your perspective as well.

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,723
- Yeah absolutely, I mean, number one,

194
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:29,910
LogicMonitor with the
introduction of Edwin AI

195
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,250
has really set themself apart and now

196
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,410
the addition of Catchpoint
is getting stronger.

197
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,930
So, your number one ilick
for industry leaders,

198
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,770
thought leaders, but what
helps build the partnership

199
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,390
is the relationships.

200
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,950
Nothing to do with technology

201
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,890
and your partner program
and how you work together

202
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,490
to solve customer needs and requirements.

203
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,920
And then also, for me personally,

204
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,140
leveraging LogicMonitor and Edwin AI

205
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,820
in our advanced technology center

206
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,400
and our AI proving ground
where we have customers

207
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,800
testing out their AI use cases

208
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,100
before they you know, de-risk
an accelerated innovation.

209
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,440
So, LogicMonitor is one of our tier one

210
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,370
Go-To-Market partners that do that.

211
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,840
And you know, knowing people
like Andrew is you know,

212
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,350
that was the deal that sold it.

213
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,670
- Yeah, so for us, look we are
making a name for ourselves

214
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,000
as one of the only full stack
transformation companies

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,400
in the world and what that means is

216
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,920
anytime we are sitting down with customers

217
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,020
and talking full stack transformation,

218
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,980
full stack observability is table stakes.

219
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,310
So what, and we've seen a lot
of success with LogicMonitor

220
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,340
at, in a lot of industries
whether it's product,

221
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,780
manufacturing, now
starting to get into sled

222
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,110
where we're seeing a lot of the features

223
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,360
that the LogicMonitor stack has.

224
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,840
Enable when you couple
that with our MSD model

225
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,280
and our breadth across
the different types of

226
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
infrastructure cloud environment,

227
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,090
we're building some very,
co-creating some very

228
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,780
compelling solutions which
are driving real time value

229
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,280
for our customers.

230
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,390
I think that's, that's a
great partnership model

231
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,400
that we're looking to
continue to expand on

232
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,380
and take it across all sectors.

233
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,050
- Great, yeah, and just
to underscore the point.

234
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,780
I mean, you guys and your organizations

235
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,500
reflect different realms
of the partner ecosystem

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
and so there is the kind
of service offerings

237
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,090
that you're delivering for your customers,

238
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,090
the ability to test in
WWT's test environment

239
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,010
and then the practices and services

240
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,440
that both of your organizations
offer your customers.

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,531
So, it's really multifaceted partnership

242
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,210
with both organizations.

243
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,580
And then, we'll talk about
the AWS angle as well

244
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,103
because we're all
partnering with AWS also.

245
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,380
Great, and you know, I think
partnership is really key

246
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,720
and the industry has been talking about

247
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,910
monitoring to observability
and this journey

248
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,060
from reactive to proactive
for quite some time.

249
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,860
Like, that's not a new story,

250
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,810
but I think what has been changing

251
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,920
and what's been evolving,

252
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,770
you know AIOps has been
around for about a decade

253
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,010
as a concept and it
started with, you know,

254
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,910
machine learning.

255
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,130
It started with, you know,

256
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,990
deterministic kind of models

257
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,050
and having to kind of train the system

258
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,570
to have it learn a lot and now you know,

259
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,670
it's evolved into this Agentic state

260
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,110
which is very exciting.

261
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,540
We see this as a really
significant tipping point

262
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,940
for the industry and it's
something that is happening

263
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,430
because of partnerships like you know,

264
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,880
LogicMonitor with NTT,
with Worldwide Technology,

265
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,770
with the other partners that we have.

266
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,550
This is really the
thing that is propelling

267
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,850
the industry forward that
ultimately benefits you

268
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,030
and your organizations
as you're thinking about

269
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,780
what autonomous IT is gonna
look like in your organizations.

270
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,830
You've got you know,

271
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,810
a technology provider like LogicMonitor.

272
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,390
We're spending our days
thinking about that

273
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,610
and then we've got partner
organizations like this

274
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,810
that are, that are laser
focused on it as well.

275
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,910
- Yeah, and I love the term,

276
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,621
it's no longer optional, it's mandatory.

277
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,454
- Yeah.

278
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:12,287
Yeah.

279
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:15,543
- Also observability and
autonomous IT Operations,

280
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,770
it's table, no it's not table stakes

281
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,240
but it's a differentiator.

282
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,640
Set yourself apart from excelling.

283
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,570
- Yeah, that's right

284
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,250
and I think, you know,

285
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,440
if we'd had this conversation a year ago

286
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,450
we might have had a different time horizon

287
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,792
but the urgency, the sense of
how fast things are changing

288
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,740
really doesn't make it
optional these days.

289
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,301
We've talked a little bit
about how we work together.

290
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,840
I'd love to double click
on this a little bit more

291
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,540
to talk about what the
value is for customers

292
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,540
and clients and Abhi, maybe
to start with you around that.

293
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,590
You know, NTT and LogicMonitor have been

294
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,720
working together for several years.

295
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,300
What do you see as the ways

296
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,270
that we're working together to drive value

297
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,500
for your clients and for your customers?

298
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,280
- Yeah, I think there's a
few aspects to it, right?

299
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,140
I think right off the bat,

300
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,720
the way we deliver manage services

301
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,120
has fundamentally
changed with partnerships

302
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,523
like we have at LogicMonitor, right?

303
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,850
I was having a conversation
with a customer

304
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,383
a couple days ago and,

305
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,240
they didn't wanna talk the traditional

306
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,740
L1 through L3 support model.

307
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,860
They were, they were pushing us on

308
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,223
why we even need an L1.

309
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,050
Like, why can't I have agents deployed

310
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,050
who can proactively track
events, correlate them,

311
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,860
bring in closed loop
automation for resolution,

312
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,720
do real time RCA?

313
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,571
Those are questions that you know,

314
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:51,840
up until six months ago were not part of

315
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,120
our core solutioning platforms.

316
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,910
They were, they were nice to have.

317
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,830
Now, we are forced to
think along those lines

318
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,290
because of the recent
successes we have seen

319
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,500
when you, when LogicMonitor
and NTT have gone to customers

320
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,530
and put these kind of
FSO solutions out there.

321
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,459
So, I think right off the bat

322
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,810
the way we are going
to market has changed.

323
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,200
The second thing I wanna
highlight is the flexibility

324
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
in how we are approaching customers.

325
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,201
Traditionally as a Mana services,

326
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:29,580
you're doing fixed cost,
fixed bed type of solutions

327
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,960
which are driven by SLAs.

328
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,980
Now, we have outcome based solutions

329
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,770
or outcome based models,
Go-To-Market models

330
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,720
that we can put in front of customers.

331
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,470
We have, other service options,

332
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,410
whether it's just consuming
an observability stack.

333
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,410
We have flexibility in
control of the infrastructure

334
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,390
and observability sweeps for customers.

335
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,620
I'll give you a very quick example

336
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,350
and then I'd love to hear
what Mike has to say.

337
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,987
We are working with a company
that's building a gigafactory

338
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,610
outside of Memphis,
Tennessee and they wanted to

339
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,120
have us come in and stand up
their entire infrastructure

340
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,803
including their knock and sock.

341
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,030
For the sock, they wanted us to deploy it

342
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,990
and they would manage it.

343
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,450
For the knock, they wanted us to build,

344
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,240
run, transform continuously.

345
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,339
Partners like LogicMonitor,

346
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,658
we have that flexibility where we could,

347
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:33,658
even within that space, give
them two very different models

348
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,910
and that's what customers are looking for.

349
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,050
They're looking for flexibility

350
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,330
in how they consume services.

351
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,340
From MSPs they're looking at,

352
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,161
they're very cost conscious

353
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,750
so that's something that I'm seeing

354
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,899
as a great add on with the
partnership with you guys.

355
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,480
- Yeah, and that's a fantastic example.

356
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,180
And I suspect, I mean, given,

357
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,730
NTT is very familiar with scale.

358
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,850
I mean, you guys have been
operating at global scale.

359
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,390
Gigafactories,
mega-gigafactories, scale is not,

360
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,510
you know, not a new thing for NTT

361
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,220
but I imagine that there's pressures

362
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,110
around speed of deployment.

363
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,000
So, you know, I won't put you on the spot

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,310
to mention how fast they
wanted that all deployed

365
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,400
but I suspect that the speed element

366
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,510
comes into play as well.

367
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,090
- It does and to be very honest

368
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,590
it makes us uncomfortable.

369
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,470
It does, because we are that giant

370
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,185
who's learning to run fast now.

371
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,018
- Yeah.

372
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:32,640
- And we need partners who
bring in those capabilities

373
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,820
off the bat instead of us investing time

374
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,260
in building said capabilities.

375
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,093
- Yeah.

376
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,320
- That's why these partnerships
become invaluable for us

377
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,570
because you know, you guys are helping us

378
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,390
get to that speed that
traditionally was foreign to us.

379
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,453
- Yep, and combining the speed and scale

380
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,680
is it's own challenge.

381
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,920
Well, Mike, from the reseller perspective

382
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,540
and that partner perspective,

383
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,420
you mentioned a little bit
about the test bed environment

384
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,030
and allowing kind of customers to come in

385
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,790
and actually test the
technology before deploying it

386
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,770
but what are some of the other ways?

387
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,630
I mean, I'd love to have
you talk more about that

388
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,185
and also, you know, other
ways that Worldwide Tech

389
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:12,240
and LogicMonitor are partnering together.

390
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,283
- Yeah, sure, good stuff, thank you.

391
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,140
Yeah, so for us, we're
getting a lot of demand

392
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,073
for tactical tool
replacements, that's fine,

393
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,290
but what I like even better

394
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,080
is more of a top down strategic approach.

395
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,890
Like, how do we build our
next generation Knock,

396
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,870
our next generation Sock,

397
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,390
our next generation
enterprise command center,

398
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,213
or as my alma mater calls
it now, mission control,

399
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,610
and how do we take back

400
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,643
if we've over-rotated to multiple MSPs,

401
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,570
how do we measure using SLOs
and change management risk

402
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,740
and leveraging AI,

403
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,530
how do we have that Agentic L1 response?

404
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,270
Where you know, when
it may not necessarily

405
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,597
be replacing headcount but at reducing

406
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:02,220
and freeing up those resources

407
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,040
to work on more strategic
transformational things.

408
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,098
I think that's Edwin AI
can do and we've seen it

409
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:10,530
and it's real.

410
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,490
The Agentic L1 response, it's not a myth

411
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,850
and like, for NTT, it can help
streamline your operations

412
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,557
and add more value, added services for us.

413
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:25,500
You know, it's showing a proof
of a multi OAM environment

414
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,853
which every customer's in.

415
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,500
How do you integrate that and leverage

416
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,390
event driven automation and now

417
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,693
the next generation of that
autonomous IT Op automation?

418
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,440
And getting to those insights

419
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,710
through the tsunami of noise alerts events

420
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,600
and get to a correlation.

421
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,740
And we have a reference

422
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,640
architecture methodology that we like.

423
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,450
When we go in, you probably
don't wanna hear this

424
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,370
but when we go into a customer

425
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,890
we wanna maximize and leverage

426
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,140
what they've already invested.

427
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,190
Um, and we'll uncover blind
spots and redundancies

428
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,540
but we've got opinions based on what

429
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,830
we've kicked the tires on everyday in

430
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,390
our advanced technology center

431
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,240
and we'll give our opinion
on not just LogicMonitor

432
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,730
and it's capabilities but
the Edwin AI capability

433
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,380
and how that's changing the game.

434
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,213
And now with Catchpoint...

435
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,165
- Yeah.

436
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:16,320
- That'll be a great new path for us.

437
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,460
- Yeah, I was just thinking

438
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,170
and we don't have to commit to it here

439
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,110
but I think getting Catchpoint
into the mix as well

440
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,930
is gonna be, is gonna make it
even more, more compelling.

441
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,780
- Yeah, 'cause to me where
the rubber meets the road

442
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,280
is that user experience.

443
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,113
- Yeah.

444
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:31,210
- Digital user experience.

445
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,043
(audience clapping)

446
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:32,876
Thank you.

447
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,503
Digital user experience.

448
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,230
That's your business health.

449
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,063
- Yeah.

450
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:39,780
- Like for American
Express when I was there,

451
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,080
it was measuring the card member journeys.

452
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,200
Mapping that, instrumenting
that from stem to stern

453
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,670
across multiple hosting domains,

454
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,111
mainframe, across the gambit.

455
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:52,911
That's the true health, not hey,

456
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:55,647
my network's up, my applications are up

457
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,750
but my customers are still having issues.

458
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,930
- Yeah, and I think with
this and synthetics...

459
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,763
- Yes.

460
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,603
- Being able to run those tests as well.

461
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,180
So, you know, we've been talking,

462
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,370
we just jumped right in and
we started talking about

463
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,800
Agentic AIOps, Mike,
you've mentioned you know,

464
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,130
Edwin AI is our Agentic AIOps product.

465
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,080
AIOps as a concept has been,

466
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,850
is a decade or so old.

467
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,700
The concept, everybody's talking about AI

468
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,340
so I think like, to take a step back maybe

469
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,220
you know, what do you guys see as

470
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,380
making Agentic AIOps so different

471
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,420
from kind of just traditional AI

472
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,280
or machine learning models

473
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,410
or even just you know, kind of good old

474
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,864
if this happens then
do some action, right?

475
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,020
Would love to get your
perspectives on this

476
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,280
and Mike, maybe we'll start with you.

477
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,930
What do you see is fundamentally different

478
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,030
with Agentic AIOps?

479
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,450
- Um, it's the ability
to take multiple actions.

480
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,773
So, in, you know, machine
learning's been around forever.

481
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,870
Pattern matching, event correlation,

482
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,850
that's been around for a while

483
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,310
but this autonomous way to,

484
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,460
you know, still using
LLMs with RAG is the brain

485
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,643
but now using Agentic AI to you know,

486
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,690
make recommendations, in
seconds analyze what changed,

487
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,140
you know, checking the change
of management database,

488
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,813
knowledge articles, product manuals,

489
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,940
even conversational unstructured
data in your slack channels

490
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,080
and bringing that to the forefront of that

491
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,710
strategic resource, the SRE person

492
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,890
that would normally take
10s of minutes if not hours

493
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,227
and do that in seconds.

494
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,877
You know, everyone has dashboards

495
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,060
but just probably each
organizational unit has it.

496
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,010
Their own persona based dashboard.

497
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,280
How do you quickly
interpret those in seconds?

498
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,723
That's Agentic AI.

499
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,573
- Yeah, that's great

500
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,500
and Abhi would love your perspectives.

501
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,200
We talked about kind of speed and scale

502
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,980
and what are you seeing and
what is your team seeing

503
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,525
around the differences with Agentic AIOps?

504
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:04,470
- Yes, I think for us
it's two fold, right?

505
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,580
One is the core design principle behind

506
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,580
any Agentic AI ecosystem is the modularity

507
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,280
and the unit based elementary
design principles, right?

508
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,630
So, that's where I think that Agentic AI

509
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,790
differentiates itself from traditional AI

510
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,790
because when you have
autonomous independent agent

511
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,660
working in a closed loop
collaborative AI system,

512
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,850
you're making decisions at speed.

513
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,120
You're learning from
continuous speed back loops

514
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,120
and you're continuously
improving not just the service

515
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,700
that said agents are providing

516
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,700
but the infrastructure
and the environment health

517
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:56,550
that continues to improve
because of the actions

518
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,900
these agents take, right?

519
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,763
So, that flexibility and
those marginal benefits,

520
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,040
when you start scaling those,

521
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,900
that's where real value is driven.

522
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,800
Right, I think that's one
thing that's big for us.

523
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,800
The second thing is
you're seeing a lot of,

524
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,180
you know we talk a lot about speed

525
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,300
but it's the, it's the
intelligence combined

526
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,150
with that speed which is making,

527
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,213
which is driving these
values for customers.

528
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,850
Some of my customers are
not looking at SLAs anymore.

529
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,970
They are looking at
environment improvement.

530
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,970
They're asking us to
track patterns and trends

531
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,970
in their infrastructure
usage and correlate those

532
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,770
with some of their business events.

533
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,243
Some business trigger events.

534
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:55,290
Agentic AI is the answer,

535
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,290
or is the path to measuring
those kind of outcomes.

536
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,780
- That's really great and I think that's,

537
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,400
I mean, we're only beginning that.

538
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
So, it's like, if we project forward

539
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,923
it's gonna be kind of mind boggling.

540
00:24:08,923 --> 00:24:11,430
You know, that initial
shift that you described

541
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,310
from an SLA into actually
being more proactive

542
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,960
and to improving the environment.

543
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,490
I mean, imagine what we'll be saying

544
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,560
in a year or two from now when more

545
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,510
and more of your customers
have implemented that.

546
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,593
- Yep, absolutely.

547
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:26,910
- And so Abhi, let's stick with you

548
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,640
and talk, you've mentioned
a little bit already

549
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,680
around the shifts in the MSP model.

550
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,350
I was especially interested
in what you shared about

551
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,460
your clients actually asking for you know,

552
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,670
AI agents in place of L1s potentially.

553
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,500
Are your clients kind of
thinking through that?

554
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,140
But, I'd love you to say
more about the changes

555
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,320
that you're seeing in the MSP model

556
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,460
as a result of AIOps and Agentic AI.

557
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,293
- Look, like I said, right,

558
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,600
I mean, there's the
traditional levels where,

559
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,990
you know, your Agentic AIOps is helping us

560
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,823
reduce the cost.

561
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:02,910
Right?

562
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,940
And that's, in today's
market in the MSP space,

563
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,050
you know that's becoming a core function

564
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,802
of what we take to our customers, right?

565
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,800
Most customers ask for
40, 45, 50% productivity

566
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,970
over a three year term.

567
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,310
You don't do that through
the traditional levels

568
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,680
of sourcing and parameter
adjustments, right?

569
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,940
You've got to find ways
to reduce the environment

570
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,220
that you're serving in order to get there.

571
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,810
So, AIOps gets you that, right?

572
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,470
The second thing is,
some of the predictive

573
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,580
and proactive monitoring
helps you prevent incidents

574
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,830
before they become incidents, right?

575
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,930
And that's something that most customers

576
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,420
have come to expect from us, right?

577
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,167
So, those are a couple of things

578
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:50,010
and then the third thing is,
you know with real time RCAs,

579
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,570
with close loop automation
around elimination at source

580
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,790
for some of the root causes,

581
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,320
that's helping you reduce the environment

582
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,150
that you are serving which in turn

583
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,610
is driving value, not
just for our customers

584
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,687
but for us internally as well.

585
00:26:06,687 --> 00:26:11,040
And as an MSP there's only

586
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,013
a limited set of delivery headcount

587
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,150
that any organization can maintain

588
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,620
while being cost effective, right.

589
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,590
So, we have got to make sure our resources

590
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,590
are secundered to projects
while keeping in mind

591
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,580
that we have a large
customer base to serve.

592
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,620
And that's where the technology of AIOps

593
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,180
is coming and helping us.

594
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,380
- Yeah, that's great and Mike,

595
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,610
I wonder, you're working
with MSPs and end clients.

596
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,350
Like, what's your take on this?

597
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,130
Are you hearing kind of similar things?

598
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,360
- Yeah, it's definitely
like for the Telco's,

599
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,280
where the network is their business

600
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,950
and also for financial services obviously,

601
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,820
we're seeing a push to you know,

602
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,420
help them create and
Agentic network assistant.

603
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,890
Kind of that would be the
overall brains, the orchestrator

604
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,550
but then plugging into the Agentic AI loop

605
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,355
where you've got something like Edwin AI

606
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:16,350
that it's gonna pull

607
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,860
and then also your agent
can talk to the Dynatrace,

608
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Davis AI agent talk to the
new Datadog bits AI agent

609
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,140
and bring that in to contact.

610
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,540
'Cause if you need that
application deep visibility

611
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,573
to find out what's going on,
is it something in your code?

612
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,060
And then obviously with Catchpoint

613
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,200
being able to determine,

614
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,910
is it something out in the internet

615
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,650
that's outside your firewalls?

616
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,194
So, yeah we're definitely seeing

617
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:46,590
the MSPs, the Telcos, the GSPs

618
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,076
as leading the way to help them get to,

619
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:51,540
get ahead of the curve
and stop being blamed.

620
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,860
That meantime innocence,
being able to be proactive

621
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,190
if not very prescriptive and predictive

622
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,450
for service disruptions.

623
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,670
And get ahead of that
instead of that react,

624
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,510
and some of it's people
process skills culture,

625
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,910
but it's also technology
and it's really starting,

626
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,235
you know, looking at that whole gambit

627
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:13,350
and it's, you know observability in AIOps

628
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,700
is a team sport.

629
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,380
It needs to be end to end.

630
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,730
- Yeah, I think that's right

631
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,340
and I also see it as you know,

632
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,560
you mentioned some of the agent to agent

633
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,800
and sort of MCP type infrastructure.

634
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,530
That is definitely an
emerging area that we're

635
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,510
investing in and you're gonna see

636
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,150
a lot more from us in that sense

637
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,670
in terms of being able to enable Edwin

638
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,960
to talk to other agents,

639
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,440
whether it's ServiceNow or you know,

640
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,000
some other set of agents

641
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,320
and then I think, you know,

642
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,060
picking up on what you said as well,

643
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,450
I also see a convergence of the needs

644
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:53,450
that end customers have as
well as the MSP dynamics.

645
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,630
And so, these are worlds that
in a sense are converging

646
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,370
and it's similar sets of concerns.

647
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,310
And even if you're at an IT organization

648
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,730
at an enterprise you know,
you can learn some things

649
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,620
from the way MSPs are operating.

650
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,967
You may be working with MSPs

651
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,430
and so all of these elements kind of

652
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,180
are coming together and converging.

653
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,400
And you know, of course
we're here at re:Invent.

654
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,760
We're all in the AWS
partner ecosystem as well.

655
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,120
We'll talk about AWS
marketplace in a few minutes.

656
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,980
LogicMonitor as a platform
uses AWS as our infrastructure.

657
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,620
Would love to hear more
about how your organizations

658
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,190
are working with AWS and how AWS services

659
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,980
come into the mix with
everything we're speaking about.

660
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,080
And maybe Abhi, we'll start with you

661
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,850
around what you can
share about AWS services,

662
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,605
whether that's AI
applications or more broadly

663
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:51,510
how you all partner
with and work with AWS.

664
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,870
- Yeah, this is a very,
very exciting space for us.

665
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,690
We are, we have been traditionally known

666
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,780
to be a large infrastructure
company, right?

667
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,790
So, when we are talking to customers

668
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,100
about their AI initiatives,

669
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,840
the first thing that comes to mind is,

670
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,840
how can a partner like
NTT build a scalable,

671
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,140
nimble AI foundation?

672
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,880
And we call it the horsepower, right?

673
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,030
But, and we bring in some of those combued

674
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,295
and storage elements to it

675
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:24,540
with technology such as Bedrock, right?

676
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,930
That helps you design those,

677
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,560
those flexible but at the same time

678
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,320
cost effective foundations that customers

679
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,690
no longer have to invest
capital in, right?

680
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,530
So, that's a huge area where
we're partnering with Amazon

681
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,080
around Bedrock and then
building these foundations.

682
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,320
Then you start getting
into what we call as

683
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,470
your curated AI orchestration lair.

684
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,680
That way where you're building
and managing an environment

685
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,350
where a customer, we're
giving them all the plugins,

686
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,450
they need to connect
all their data sources

687
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,690
whether it's their MRPs
and their ERP systems,

688
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,370
their metadata systems, their real,

689
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,220
their factory floor scale systems.

690
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,870
So, all that data ingestion
comes to customers as a service

691
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,780
instead of them again
investing and building these.

692
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,290
And then you start thinking
about things like SageMaker.

693
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:21,290
That's a great tool set
within the Amazon ecosystem

694
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,660
that helps us build
that kind of capability.

695
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,670
And then you start getting
into the agent to agent

696
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,403
collaboration that Mike
was talking about, right?

697
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,360
They look at things like Amazon queue,

698
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,960
they, that is accelerating,

699
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,130
all of this is technology
everybody's experimenting with.

700
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,410
People are finding challenges around

701
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,000
whether it's domain specific.

702
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,610
Challenges whether it's
security compliance challenges

703
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,530
but that, these are the kind of things

704
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,200
that are giving us headstart in that

705
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,200
from the Amazon ecosystem
that is giving us

706
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,250
the acceleration that
customers are looking for.

707
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,720
- Yeah, that's great.

708
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,860
Mike, what about you?

709
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,070
How's Worldwide Technology
working with AWS services

710
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,990
in the AI space?

711
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,550
- Yeah sure, so those
products that were mentioned,

712
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,400
definitely extending those capabilities

713
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,340
to the operational models
that the LogicMonitor

714
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,350
and Edwin AI could bring.

715
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,470
It's like that Agentic loop
that I was talking about

716
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,333
but also, just from working
with Amazon on migrations.

717
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:28,980
From on-prem to AWS,

718
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,550
being able to give that
performance baseline

719
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,910
before, during, and after the migration.

720
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,910
'Cause a lot of folks either refactor

721
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,779
or lift and throw over the fence.

722
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,910
There are applications
that may not be optimal

723
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,023
for Cloud Native.

724
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,840
You need to be able to
quickly determine that

725
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,570
with a tool like LogicMonitor.

726
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,020
Cloud Watch and some of the newer tools

727
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,310
that we just mentioned.

728
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,110
You need to see that full visibility.

729
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,880
You need to see behind the curtain as well

730
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,960
whereas you know,
companies like Catchpoint,

731
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,840
ThousandEyes, tell you up to a point,

732
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,500
up to the front door
of AWS what's going on.

733
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,700
You need to see behind the scenes.

734
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,370
What's really going on in your S3 buckets

735
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,680
and a lot of these tools for Marketplace

736
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,540
that a lot of companies are using

737
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,903
for data link analysis
and that correlation.

738
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,420
- Yeah, I think that's right

739
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,700
and one of the things we're looking at

740
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,350
from the LogicMonitor perspective

741
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,230
is the observability and monitoring

742
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,940
of the AI workloads themselves.

743
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,910
So I mean, we have
multiple dimensions here

744
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,180
to think through, so we have observability

745
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,840
over all those AWS AI services

746
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,040
as well as a number of others

747
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,740
in terms of cloud monitoring.

748
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,350
I think cost comes into play as well.

749
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,840
Mike, ensuring that you're optimizing

750
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,200
for resource allocation and cost

751
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,270
certainly comes into a factor there.

752
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,640
So, we on the LogicMonitor side of things

753
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,050
are thinking about this both

754
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,957
as a consumer of AWS services ourselves,

755
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:07,290
facilitating clients and their migrations

756
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,970
and their use of AWS services

757
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,580
with you know, partners like these.

758
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,330
And then, also ensuring
that IT Operations teams

759
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,790
that are running these
services day in and day out

760
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,299
have full visibility
into what's happening.

761
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:22,950
At the cloud layer and then now

762
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,240
with the addition of Catchpoint,

763
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,970
being able to see that
at the internet layer,

764
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,580
the user layer as well.

765
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,790
- Yeah, it's kind of the other
side of the same coin, right?

766
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,870
You need AI for observability.

767
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,990
You also need observability in AI

768
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,120
or your AI ecosystems,
whether it's in the cloud

769
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,180
or on-prem, like I know
AWS announced factories.

770
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,897
Kind of like almost like
an AI pod in your on-prem.

771
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:52,897
That should be bundled with the
business health capabilities

772
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,843
that LogicMonitor and Edwin AI bring

773
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,647
to manage and understand the work flows.

774
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:00,150
Are the LOMs operating?

775
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,168
Are they pulling accurate data?

776
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,530
Have the sources changed?

777
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,480
Not just GPU monitoring.

778
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,020
You know, but the work
flows, the LOMs, the agents.

779
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,870
Giving you, you know, your
investment is paying off

780
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,610
as you intended.

781
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,076
- So, we've talked a
little about this already

782
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:18,360
but coming back to you know,

783
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,530
what we're using and I'm gonna

784
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,940
broaden the question a little bit.

785
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,830
We're talking about MSPs but I think it's

786
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,040
actually more broadly like enterprises

787
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,070
as well as MSPs kind of using AI agents

788
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,880
to solve real problems
in their organizations

789
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,960
and in their operations

790
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,880
and so Mike, maybe you
could say a little bit more

791
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,380
about what you're seeing there.

792
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,270
You mentioned financial services.

793
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,650
You mentioned a few industries

794
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,070
but say more about how AI agents

795
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,950
are kind of working in production today

796
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,560
to solve real problems for organizations.

797
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,960
- Yeah, it's kinda that moving,

798
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,090
I'm seeing companies
moving from having people

799
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,310
that are martyrs to working smarter.

800
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,420
That rhymes on purpose.

801
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,650
Martyr to smarter.

802
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,483
But anyway...

803
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:00,316
- You should be in marketing.

804
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:04,590
- Anyway, there's a lot of tasset tribal,

805
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,780
my wife says tribal
knowledge is not PC correct

806
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,747
but tasset knowledge.

807
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:12,120
These engineers that have CCIEs

808
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,320
and been doing it for decades

809
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,170
and just have that intrinsic knowledge.

810
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,955
How do we capture that?

811
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:20,790
In not just knowledge based articles

812
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,950
but what do they typically do?

813
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,730
What are the three or
four steps these SMEEs do

814
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,550
to understand the fault domain?

815
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,997
You know, get the isolation
then get to the root cause.

816
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:37,740
Like I said, look at your
last six months of incidents.

817
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,690
Did this happen before?

818
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,490
What was the blast radius?

819
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,543
What was the fix?

820
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,860
Do that with AI, Agentic AI in seconds

821
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,090
versus the 10s and 10s of
minutes, hours it may take

822
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,800
for someone to do that manually

823
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,170
and not to replace those SMEEs.

824
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,930
It's more of a digital colleague, right?

825
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,030
You still need a human in the loop.

826
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,850
It's just getting them to work smarter

827
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,850
versus you know being on
those long bridge call,

828
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,865
warrior calls.

829
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:07,698
- Yeah, I think you know,

830
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,810
I think every organization's
gonna think through this

831
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,050
like what is replacement,
what is augmentation

832
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,430
and finding that right mix?

833
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,864
Because even the best
subject matter expert

834
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:20,790
in their specific domain doesn't
have the domain knowledge

835
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,867
of all the other domains, right?

836
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:22,700
- [Mike] Right.

837
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,810
- So, the database guy is
calling the network guy

838
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,757
and the network guy is
calling the infrastructure guy

839
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:31,920
or what not, so putting
AI agents in to the mix

840
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,860
is gonna augment even the
best subject matter expert

841
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,750
in their domain by giving them access

842
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,187
to other domain knowledge.

843
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:41,250
Abhi, you've talked a
bit about the services

844
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,060
that NTT is delivering and your approach

845
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,710
to leveraging AI agents.

846
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,010
Would love to hear more around

847
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,410
how you're using AI
agents to solve problems

848
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,400
for your clients.

849
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,565
- Yes, so for us,

850
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,850
one of the things that differentiates us

851
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,520
from the rest of the
MSPs that we compete with

852
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,630
is we have a very tool and
platform driven approach

853
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,490
to MSP solutions.

854
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,490
So, we invest heavily in
enhancing our platform capability

855
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,720
and bringing all these AI agents.

856
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,373
We do a lot of internal IT.

857
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,390
The IT that we serve
within our organization

858
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,790
across the globe, we use AI...

859
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,990
- Eat your own caviar.

860
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,223
- We do, we absolutely do.

861
00:38:23,223 --> 00:38:25,020
- It's not dog food, it's caviar, right?

862
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,860
- Thank you so much.

863
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,930
That's a good choice of words.

864
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,000
So, we use a lot of,

865
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,187
we use a lot of Agentic AI

866
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:36,300
and LogicMonitor solutions
to do event correlation

867
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,700
that will noise suppression.

868
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,360
Then analysis, anomaly
detection, incident triage,

869
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,910
we are actually using a lot of that

870
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,430
in our internal IT Ops, right?

871
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,510
I'll give another example.

872
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:53,367
We use, we are starting to
adopt a lot of Agentic AI

873
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,314
or rather agents for some of
our Go-To-Market functions.

874
00:38:58,314 --> 00:38:59,373
Right?

875
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:02,370
In some of our operational
and financial functions.

876
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,610
So, there is, this goes beyond serving

877
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,700
just our customers and our
customers love to hear that story

878
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,220
because they're looking for partners

879
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,650
who are actually, like you said,

880
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,910
eating their own caviar.

881
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,790
We are showing them examples of how we,

882
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,490
and again, just a quick
sidebar about NTT, right?

883
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,165
We have been a collection of companies.

884
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:26,340
We have been, over the
years built capability

885
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,573
by acquiring a lot of niche companies

886
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:32,040
and integration has been a
continuous challenge for us.

887
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,780
And when we go to customers and tell them,

888
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,723
we understand, for example,

889
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:38,430
we open the door of
private equity companies

890
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,460
and we tell them, we know what it is

891
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,680
to integrate Opcos together.

892
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,810
We know how to standardize operations

893
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,970
and infrastructures together.

894
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,790
Those are the kind of stories
that gel with our customers

895
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,040
because of some of this caviar

896
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,320
that we are eating
ourselves and showing them

897
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,060
the results of.

898
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,013
- Yeah, same with Worldwide.

899
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:02,790
We like to eat our own caviar as well.

900
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,760
You know, we've built our
own Agentic network assistant

901
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,120
because someone new coming
into a company our size

902
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,040
it's hard to find things.

903
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,480
It's all over the place

904
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,330
and also since we do a lot of RFPs,

905
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,253
an RFP AI assistant.

906
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,280
Let's try to simplify things
and show that we use it.

907
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,370
And also our own internal
IT operations team

908
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,820
uses LogicMonitor for the operations

909
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,680
of the warehouses, factories,

910
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,630
and the advanced technology center.

911
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,460
So, I think that says a lot.

912
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,120
If we're using LogicMonitor
for our own internal IT

913
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,960
there's something there.

914
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,433
- Yeah, well we at
LogicMonitor use LogicMonitor

915
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:44,310
on LogicMonitor, we actually...

916
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,143
- No way.

917
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,472
- Yeah, who'd have thought, right?

918
00:40:46,472 --> 00:40:49,410
But we're very much in that,

919
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,205
drink our own champagne,
eat our own caviar

920
00:40:52,205 --> 00:40:55,093
kind of club as well and in fact

921
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:58,590
at our annual customer conference

922
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,330
that was our sort of mainstage demo.

923
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,000
Rather than having marketing folks like me

924
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,280
come up with some fictitious scenario

925
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,390
we actually did a demo of
our own use of LogicMonitor

926
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,870
across our infrastructure and our AWS

927
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,700
and other kind of global infrastructure

928
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,452
to deliver our own platform.

929
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:20,400
And some of the first integration
points with Catchpoint

930
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,580
and LogicMonitor, it's, you
know, the Catchpoint team

931
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,240
using LogicMonitor to
understand their infrastructure

932
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,700
and LogicMonitor using Catchpoint.

933
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,110
So, that's one of the first things

934
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,930
as we were starting the
integration discussions

935
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,493
it was getting those teams together

936
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,710
and you know, you can even,

937
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,720
well, we'll talk about going
to our booth in a minute

938
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,220
and giving the commercial for that

939
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,200
but you can even see some of that

940
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,903
at our booth here at re:Invent.

941
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,580
You know, so your
organizations are all in.

942
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,310
It sounds like your clients
are sort of asking you

943
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,840
like, how do we go quickly?

944
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,600
How do we do this now?

945
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,430
But, you know, what should organizations

946
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,780
be thinking about in terms
of their readiness for AIOps

947
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,220
and Agentic AI?

948
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,710
Because there's a lot of buzzwords.

949
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,260
There's a lot of
marketing speak out there.

950
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,930
There's a lot of urgency to go quickly

951
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,270
and to move quickly.

952
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,220
What should organizations
be thinking about?

953
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,590
And Mike, maybe we'll
start with you on that.

954
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,620
- Yeah sure, we do a
lot of AIOps workshops

955
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,113
and we try to do, you know a baseline of

956
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:28,590
where they're currently at.

957
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,950
Are they still in that crawl stage?

958
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,710
Still doing reactive
monitoring, firefighting?

959
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,020
Are they starting to be a
little bit more proactive?

960
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,440
To you know prescriptive, to predictive?

961
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,440
And a lot of companies need to
first unify the observability

962
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:50,220
'cause there's a lot of siloed fiefdoms.

963
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,290
All this spare data.

964
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,350
All these huge haystacks of data

965
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,810
and you need to help them
to find the right needle

966
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,710
at the right time and that's
what AIOps can do for them.

967
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,840
It's not a tool.

968
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,960
It's a discipline of
people, process, culture,

969
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,670
and yes, the right technology.

970
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,720
So, a lot of the things
we're working on is that,

971
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,800
the next operating model,

972
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,050
what should our operating model look like

973
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,470
to take advantage of things
like AIOps and Agentic AI?

974
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,920
And it's, you know
organizational structure wise

975
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,920
it's skill wise, and it's
also the right technology.

976
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,390
And having that unified
integrated end to end view

977
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,100
of a healthier business.

978
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,933
- Yeah, that's great.

979
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:37,680
Abhi, what's your perspective on this?

980
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,270
You've already been working with

981
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,530
a number of clients around this.

982
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,377
What should they be thinking about?

983
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:43,170
- Yeah, and look, it's very easy

984
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,610
to get preachy on this topic, right?

985
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,520
Because everybody has
an opinion on how AIOps

986
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,353
should be adopted.

987
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:49,920
You know, I'll give you live examples

988
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,440
of what we are seeing with
some of our customers, right?

989
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,920
I think the number one
challenge we are seeing is

990
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,440
that change in mindset and culture, right?

991
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,470
That need to continue to hug a system

992
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,990
and not rely on an autonomous agent.

993
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,820
That need to fundamentally,

994
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,170
like Mike said, right,

995
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,360
rethink your operating model.

996
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,193
- Yeah.

997
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,026
- Right?

998
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:15,840
It's, it's a very easy topic to talk on.

999
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,930
It's incredibly difficult to execute.

1000
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,000
Some of, in fact, some of the places

1001
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,700
where we are starting
to see success in AIOps

1002
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,390
even with LogicMonitor and well talk about

1003
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,773
this healthcare IT company.

1004
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,210
The intent was there from day one

1005
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,850
and yet it has taken us 12 months

1006
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,420
to start building the true FSO capability.

1007
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,330
And a lot of it had to do with adoption

1008
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,100
and that change in mindset.

1009
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,380
Yeah, so that's a huge example.

1010
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,120
The second thing that,

1011
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,350
and again this is not,

1012
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,900
this is something we are
learning from customers.

1013
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,340
Customers are getting
very good at setting small

1014
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,813
measurable goals.

1015
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,860
You know, up until six months ago

1016
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,270
we used to go to customers saying,

1017
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,040
where do you see yourself in this journey

1018
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,480
five years from now?

1019
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,970
Now it's where are you seeing yourself

1020
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,860
six months from now?

1021
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,650
And just by, just by bringing those goals

1022
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:18,510
into bit sized consumable,
actionable units

1023
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,440
people are starting to see some benefits

1024
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,380
and those successes are driving the next

1025
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,027
vehicle of initiatives along the AIOps.

1026
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:28,893
So, those are the two things
we are seeing in the market

1027
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,120
with some of our customers.

1028
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,170
- Yeah, that's great.

1029
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,280
I would just add into this,

1030
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,960
I mean, one of the things we've seen

1031
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,670
from the LogicMonitor perspective

1032
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,610
is the importance of just getting going.

1033
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,680
Just starting and doing something.

1034
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,791
So our cells internally,

1035
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:45,177
we have enterprise chat GPT

1036
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:48,060
and we've actually been
recognized by Open AI

1037
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,370
as having very high adoption.

1038
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,070
So, we have something like 95% or more

1039
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,680
of our company that are using chat,

1040
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,250
our enterprise chat GPT on a weekly basis

1041
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,840
and so that happened
because we got access to it

1042
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,540
and we were encouraged
to simply start using it.

1043
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,190
It's a little bit of a different dynamic

1044
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,260
when we're talking about IT Operations

1045
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,960
but what we see and what
we encourage clients to do

1046
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,613
is to start a POV, right?

1047
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:19,710
Work with you all in the
test bed type environment

1048
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,170
just to try something and to get going

1049
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,320
and some of our clients that
have started on that POV

1050
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,240
have literally within an hour

1051
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,660
started to see, you know,
Edwin making suggestions,

1052
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,540
reducing noise, and then it
starts this flywheel going.

1053
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,250
So, I think the biggest thing,

1054
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,300
I mean, the culture challenges,
the culture shifts are real.

1055
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,010
We're all only human

1056
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,320
but I think the biggest thing I would say

1057
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,990
is to just try and to just get going

1058
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,990
and wherever you are in this,

1059
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,630
you know define a use
case, define something

1060
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,630
that you wanna try and
just sort of make a start.

1061
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,463
- One thing I'll add.

1062
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:57,750
You know, like for
organizations like ourself,

1063
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,360
whether it's LogicMonitor or the WWTs

1064
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,770
or MSPs like us, right?

1065
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,160
It's very important to
set the right expectation

1066
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,270
with some of our customers.

1067
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,000
And then we have been guilty
of this as well, right?

1068
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,070
Where we have probably sometimes gone in

1069
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,283
and oversold the AIOps story.

1070
00:47:13,283 --> 00:47:18,283
In reality, these, these
measurable outcomes

1071
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,523
kind of help us level set
customer expectations on day one.

1072
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,790
So, you're not going and setting a stage

1073
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,933
with a customer where they're saying,

1074
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:30,060
within six months you can eliminate

1075
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,260
your entire L1 function.

1076
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,280
That's not gonna happen.

1077
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,113
- Right.
- Right.

1078
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:33,946
- Right?

1079
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:35,963
That could be an intent
but there's a path to it

1080
00:47:35,963 --> 00:47:39,540
and the technology frankly
is evolving everyday

1081
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,955
and trying to catch up with that vision.

1082
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:41,788
- Yeah.

1083
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:43,110
- So, those are some of the things

1084
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,140
that are becoming very relevant
in client conversations

1085
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,973
around AIOps.

1086
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:49,320
- Yeah, I think definitely starting small

1087
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,420
like starting with a showcase MVP.

1088
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,950
Pick a one critical user journey

1089
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,854
and one critical service and let's,

1090
00:47:55,854 --> 00:47:58,590
you know, instrument the heck out of it

1091
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,420
and you know, bring in that,

1092
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,800
the right people, the right skillset,

1093
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,160
the right technology and
measure the pre and post

1094
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,590
and that in itself could help maybe solve

1095
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,952
the cultural divide and say,

1096
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,830
this is real.

1097
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,952
I wanna do this now for the
next set of applications

1098
00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:14,820
and services

1099
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,720
- Yep.

1100
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,530
Well, as we start to wind down here,

1101
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,060
love to put on our kind of

1102
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,580
prediction crystal ball.

1103
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,870
It's always dangerous to do

1104
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,820
because things are moving so quickly

1105
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,710
but you know, autonomous IT

1106
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,140
has been on the agenda as a topic.

1107
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,210
It's been discussed for decades.

1108
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,100
It's not a new concept itself

1109
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,820
but our sense is is that
it's closer than ever

1110
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,883
to realization and I'd
love to hear you guys,

1111
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,810
if not predicting, then at least like,

1112
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,700
what do you see coming, you know,

1113
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,070
in the immediate term time horizon

1114
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,590
in terms of autonomous IT systems

1115
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,050
and so Abhi, love your thoughts on this

1116
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,940
and then Mike, we'd love
to hear from you as well.

1117
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,600
- I think we, all of us in this space

1118
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,763
have learned a lesson from
the cloud rush, right?

1119
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:08,760
Decade, 15 years ago where
everything was moved to cloud.

1120
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,460
Lift and shift, became
the standard pattern.

1121
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,760
Organizations started to
realize the diminishing value

1122
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,110
of that approach and since then

1123
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,580
the decision making for customers

1124
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,980
has become very intelligent.

1125
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,630
In the cloud parland,

1126
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,030
we're no longer talking to
customers about move the cloud.

1127
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,830
We're talking to customers about

1128
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,780
move to the right execution venue for you.

1129
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,250
That could be a hybrid STA,

1130
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,460
it could be a completely
private airgapped estate.

1131
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,500
That same principle is

1132
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,610
what I expect to apply in AI adoption.

1133
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,040
Like, customers would want to see value.

1134
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,552
We talked about POVs, right?

1135
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:47,730
There's a couple of areas

1136
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,120
where we're not seeing the
benefits of that POV approach

1137
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,153
because POVs are translated
as science experiments.

1138
00:49:55,153 --> 00:49:58,530
Yes, you can go deploy
an autonomous chat bot

1139
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,290
and make it language aware.

1140
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,930
Where is the real ROI
for that coming for me?

1141
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,763
Right?

1142
00:50:04,763 --> 00:50:08,950
So, what I'm, what I expect to see is

1143
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,760
there will be gradual adoption of the

1144
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:17,070
services software model where you have

1145
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,500
an entire end to end business process

1146
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,900
being completely driven by agent

1147
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,360
but the path to that is
going to have to be built

1148
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,300
on some very small victory blocks.

1149
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,070
Each with it's own measurable value

1150
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,140
that can stand on it's own.

1151
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,240
That's something we'll definitely see.

1152
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,100
- Mike, what's your perspective on this?

1153
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,800
- Well, I predicted you guys
would acquire Catchpoint.

1154
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,236
- So, you've got a really,

1155
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,393
you've got a really good crystal ball.

1156
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,750
- But you know, definitely just to add on.

1157
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,630
You know, it's that, AI's
not gonna replace everything.

1158
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:52,580
People's jobs, you know,

1159
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,740
it may change your jobs
but it's a collaboration.

1160
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,081
It's like I said, a digital colleague

1161
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:00,510
that's gonna work alongside you

1162
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,370
with your supervision.

1163
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:06,180
And you know, to me
the most practical use,

1164
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,320
if you've got an AI budget

1165
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,290
like everyone has had
in the last 18 months,

1166
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:13,650
the most practical use cases, AIOps

1167
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,340
or now autonomous ITs operations

1168
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,350
and bringing that intelligence forward

1169
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,050
and stop being reactive and start being,

1170
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,000
firefighting and be fire prevention

1171
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,230
and free up your resources.

1172
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,020
And also, the thing I'm seeing change is

1173
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,850
be a first class citizen.

1174
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,490
Observability has a seat at the table.

1175
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:38,850
Observability and AIOps by design.

1176
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,260
Don't wait for something to,

1177
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,640
you know, a transformation project

1178
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,760
to build a new data
center or network refresh

1179
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,620
and then say, oh shoot,

1180
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,540
we're having performance issues, why?

1181
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,023
It should be a first
class citizen by design.

1182
00:51:53,353 --> 00:51:55,650
- One thing if I may add,
just very quickly, right?

1183
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,770
It's, the one area that I think

1184
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,380
we're gonna see a very rapid adoption

1185
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,980
of Agentic AI is, as we say in our world,

1186
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,660
moving up the lairs.

1187
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,020
Right, so traditionally for MSPs

1188
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,350
come and show me my
infrastructure is healthy

1189
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:16,890
and then we move on to your
integration and API lairs

1190
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,800
and your data lairs and
your application lairs.

1191
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,773
A lot of our customers
are moving through those,

1192
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,520
those stairs very quickly.

1193
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,480
So, I'll give you an example.

1194
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,310
There's a customer we started working with

1195
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,480
about 12 months ago.

1196
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,183
It's a national insurance company.

1197
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,580
We started our Agentic AI and
AIOps MSP journey with them

1198
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,730
as just infrastructure management

1199
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:46,440
and within 12 months they have worked

1200
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,870
successfully with us to build an entire

1201
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,740
end to end plain processing
as a service model.

1202
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,530
Now, this was a company
who was ready to fail fast.

1203
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,080
They were ready to make
some of those investments

1204
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,310
but they didn't want to,

1205
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,843
they didn't want to spend too much time

1206
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:02,760
in driving the value just from

1207
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,170
your infrastructure and IT lairs.

1208
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,450
They wanted to very
quickly move up the ladder

1209
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,163
and move into the business lairs.

1210
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:10,502
So, that's the hope.

1211
00:53:10,502 --> 00:53:12,930
That for some of our customers

1212
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,000
is we find enough customers

1213
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,460
who are willing to make that leap.

1214
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,340
Willing to fail and,

1215
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,260
because that's where the future is.

1216
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,440
The future of AIOps or Agentic AI

1217
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,970
is not in as we call it,
the underground lair, right?

1218
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,393
The true value is gonna
come in the business lairs.

1219
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:34,226
- Yeah.

1220
00:53:34,226 --> 00:53:36,360
- That's the hope more than a prediction.

1221
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,100
- Absolutely and connecting it

1222
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,150
to the business outcomes
and the value is really key.

1223
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,500
As we start to wrap up here

1224
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,440
just sharing you a quick snapshot of the

1225
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,090
three year, multi year vision
that we're orienting around

1226
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,570
at LogicMonitor.

1227
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,910
We've shown this to
several different audiences

1228
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,080
over the past few months.

1229
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,890
One was an audience at
our annual analyst council

1230
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,174
so this is a closed door session

1231
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:05,174
with about 20 of the leading
observability IT Ops analysts

1232
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,340
in the space and their consensus was,

1233
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,590
all right, looks good, go ahead and do it.

1234
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,480
Then about a few weeks later

1235
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,210
we showed it to our
executive advisory board

1236
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,760
which is about 15 or so execs

1237
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,760
spanning industries,
MSPs, financial services,

1238
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,280
other industries, they
looked at this and they said,

1239
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,930
can you go faster?

1240
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,460
And you know, there may be a little bit of

1241
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,990
selection bias in that

1242
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,840
because they're obviously
a forward looking group

1243
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,120
but what we're hearing across the board

1244
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,620
and the pressure that's on our product

1245
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,200
and engineering teams is to basically

1246
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,290
deliver on this vision
to provide that value

1247
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,470
to all of you and to partners

1248
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,350
to provide to your clients
and your own customers.

1249
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,620
We see it as starting
with Agentic automation

1250
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,030
which is here now.

1251
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:55,290
We have a partnership with IBM Ansible.

1252
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,830
So, you have Edwin being
able to connect into Ansible

1253
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,020
and trigger those run books.

1254
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,000
We see this moving very quickly

1255
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,330
into a multi agent
swarming type environment.

1256
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,920
So, replicating you know,

1257
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,750
what would happen with humans today,

1258
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,180
where the database guy
talks to the network guys,

1259
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,390
well that's gonna be multiple
agents swarming together

1260
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,310
on a problem.

1261
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:20,370
And very quickly we see
this going to zero touch

1262
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:24,720
and truly to this self
healing type data center model

1263
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,850
that has been talked about for some time.

1264
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,030
And you know, it's probably
an overused analogy

1265
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,480
of self driving cars
and autonomous driving

1266
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,630
but you know, I do find it
a useful one to think with

1267
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,880
because some of us have taken a Waymo

1268
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,580
or used a full self driving kind of mode,

1269
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,950
others have not and we've just used

1270
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,240
some of the features of that

1271
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,040
to enhance our driving experience.

1272
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,940
And so, I think the autonomous IT future

1273
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,320
is here today.

1274
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,500
It's happening now and organizations

1275
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,380
are going to adopt
different elements of it

1276
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,880
to suit their business needs

1277
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,110
and their business outcomes

1278
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,770
and you know, it's great partners like NTT

1279
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,160
and Worldwide technology that
are gonna make that happen.

1280
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,200
And you know, there's a
lot of pressure I think

1281
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,680
on all of us to deliver
this vision very quickly

1282
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,690
for our respective clients.

1283
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,340
- Yeah, definitely.

1284
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,800
- Of course, have to give
a commercial announcement

1285
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,710
for our, us on the AWS Marketplace.

1286
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,970
LogicMonitor is there.

1287
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,672
We also partner with AWS.

1288
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:28,650
Edwin AI, our Agentic AIOps product

1289
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:33,240
is available on the Agentic
Marketplace with AWS.

1290
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,030
So, that's the kind of
commercial announcement.

1291
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,190
Check us out on the Marketplace.

1292
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,600
The other commercial announcement

1293
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,010
as we start to wrap up here

1294
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:44,280
is to come by our booth, 1467.

1295
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,450
We have demos there.

1296
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,443
We've got folks that are able to demo

1297
00:56:48,443 --> 00:56:50,940
and show you what the platform looks like.

1298
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,490
Show you what Edwin AI
looks like in action.

1299
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,350
You can try it yourselves.

1300
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,090
We've also got some fun activations.

1301
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:01,380
You can become, our booth
theme is Mission AI Possible.

1302
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,540
So, you can become a certified AI,

1303
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,080
AI agent yourself and we
encourage you all to do that.

1304
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,130
But on a serious note,

1305
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,600
we also have the Catchpoint team there.

1306
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,240
So, you can actually see
Catchpoint in action.

1307
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,340
You can see Edwin in action.

1308
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,990
As we start to wrap up here,

1309
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:19,350
any kind of final thoughts
from our panel here?

1310
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:20,610
Parting words?

1311
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,080
Abhi, we'll start with you.

1312
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,440
- I think, it's very encouraging

1313
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,760
what we're seeing in the market

1314
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,420
with this partnership and our goal,

1315
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,150
I think one thing where we're aligned is,

1316
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,410
we're aligned on ambition.

1317
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,420
We're aligned on the speed.

1318
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,400
We're starting to align on the technology

1319
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,030
and how what LogicMonitor
brings to the table

1320
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,800
fits seamlessly into what some of

1321
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,993
our core offerings around MSP space are.

1322
00:57:47,392 --> 00:57:50,610
We've got to be, we've got to be quick.

1323
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,683
We've got to put pressure on each other.

1324
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,540
We've gotta go and make
commitments to customers

1325
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,460
that may not be completely
feasible on day one

1326
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,310
but that's, I think that's
where growth comes from, right?

1327
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:08,700
So, I'm personally very
excited with this partnership

1328
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,500
and what we're taking
together to the market.

1329
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,060
It's a very strong story

1330
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,550
and I just hope for,
over the next 12 months

1331
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,881
we can become, we can come back here

1332
00:58:16,881 --> 00:58:18,340
and make some announcements on what

1333
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,030
we've been able to drive
as value for customers.

1334
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,080
- That's great.

1335
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,420
Mike, you've got the countdown clock.

1336
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,962
You've got a minute and a half.

1337
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:29,103
Parting words, parting
words of wisdom here, Mike.

1338
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,070
- Don't be afraid to lean in.

1339
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,973
Even if it's just a
consultation advisement.

1340
00:58:35,973 --> 00:58:39,630
We wanna give you our
perspective on the industry

1341
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:42,832
and you know, just a little announcement,

1342
00:58:42,832 --> 00:58:44,100
by the end of this month

1343
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,620
we're gonna have Edwin AI fully launched

1344
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,992
in our advanced technology center.

1345
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:48,951
- Yeah, it's great.

1346
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:50,880
- So, you get to kick the tires

1347
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,960
and have a launchable lab
and see how it integrates

1348
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,940
with all the other OEMs

1349
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,590
and that are in everyone's environment.

1350
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,570
- And, we'll work on
Catchpoint next, right?

1351
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,403
- Yes.

1352
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:02,236
- I mean, that's where we go next.

1353
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:04,080
But, no that's a great note

1354
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,390
and I think one of the
things we've talked about

1355
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,430
is there's multiple pathways in, right?

1356
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:12,060
So, there's your test bed environment.

1357
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,740
There's the POV route,

1358
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,500
there's the traditional demo type route,

1359
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,261
but like, the overall
message is to get going.

1360
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:21,633
Work with partners,
talk with LogicMonitor,

1361
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,660
you know no time like the present

1362
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,180
to get started and to move quickly so...

1363
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,013
- Absolutely.

1364
00:59:28,013 --> 00:59:29,850
- With that I think we will wrap up

1365
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,723
and thank you so much, Abhi, Mike,

1366
00:59:32,723 --> 00:59:36,870
really appreciate your
perspectives on this world

1367
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,830
that we're in.

1368
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:40,601
Please do come by the LogicMonitor booth.

1369
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:42,870
Worldwide Technology's
got a booth as well.

1370
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,260
So, you can go to the WWT booth also.

1371
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,700
We will be around afterwards

1372
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,950
if folks wanna ask us
any individual questions

1373
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,830
or come find us at the booths.

1374
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,900
And again, thank you Abhi, thank you Mike,

1375
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,733
really appreciate it.

1376
00:59:55,733 --> 00:59:56,993
- [Abhi] Thanks for having us.
