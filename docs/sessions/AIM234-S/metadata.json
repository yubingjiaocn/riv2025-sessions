  "title_cn": "I understand you're referencing an AWS re:Invent 2025 session about autonomous AI agents. However, I don't have access to the specific content or details from that particular session (AIM234).\n\nCould you provide more context about what specific aspect of autonomous AI agents you'd like to discuss? For example:\n\n- Are you looking for information about AWS services for building trustworthy AI agents?\n- Do you need help implementing AI agent architectures on AWS?\n- Are you interested in best practices for AI agent security and governance?\n- Do you have specific questions about AWS Bedrock Agents or other AWS AI services?\n\nOnce you clarify what you're looking for, I can provide relevant technical guidance and recommendations based on AWS best practices for AI agent development.",
