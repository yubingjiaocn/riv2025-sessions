1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,452
(Dan whispers)
- It's ready.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,040
- Perfect, so hi everyone.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
Thank you for being over here.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,180
Hopefully you guys had
a great AWS re:Invent.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,530
As you see, I had one.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,780
I'm starting to lose my
voice, so that's how we know

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,000
that actually we're having a great time.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,410
Thank you for being here once again.

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,790
So, my name is Dan Dobrescu.

10
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,850
I'm working at Red Hat as a
sales specialist on OpenShift,

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,270
and I have with me today Math Bruneau,

12
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,650
who's a senior containers
specialist at AWS.

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,190
And we also have our special
guest, Jean-Francois Gamache,

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,873
who is the CIO of CAE.

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,120
We chose the title today,
"From ground to cloud",

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,330
because I think it actually
talks about the aviation world.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,280
Lifting off, gaining speed, and
accelerating into the cloud.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,573
Before we get started,

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,260
I would like to set up
a little bit the stage

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,990
of what we're gonna be
talking today and OpenShift,

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,120
Red Hat OpenShift is something
that's very important

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,650
in this presentation and JF
is gonna talk a lot about it.

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,600
It's the foundation for their innovation

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,880
and as you see over here,
this is our platform.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,410
It can run anywhere, physical,
virtual, cloud, or even Edge,

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,890
and that allows customers
to have a great streamline

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,410
of application development with CICD.

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,430
It reduces operational
overhead and it helps customer

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,950
to have a consistent
experience everywhere,

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,930
wherever they're running.

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,170
And we build everything up from the ground

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,570
with our Red Hat Enterprise Linux

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,950
and Kubernetes is on top of it.

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,440
And I like to say that
Kubernetes is on steroids

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,390
with everything that we have over here.

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,510
So Math, can you please
tell us a little bit more,

37
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,010
we're at AWS re:Invent,

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,390
can you please tell us a little bit more

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,250
about how we're working together

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,160
and the partnership
between AWS and Red Hat?

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,993
- Sure, Dan.

42
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:50,910
So, the partnership with Red Hat and AWS

43
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,490
go back all the way to 2008

44
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,550
when the first version of
RHEL, Red Hat Enterprise Linux

45
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,393
was actually made available
for you to run on EC2 machine.

46
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,070
Over the years, there was many
addition feature services,

47
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,020
we'll see them in a couple slides,

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,270
but you know, one of the
very important launch

49
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,060
was the Red Hat OpenShift offering on AWS

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,040
or ROSA as we call it.

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Basically today you can run
OpenShift directly on-prem

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,140
or you know, you can manage
your own OpenShift platform

53
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,725
on EC2 machine, or if you
want a more managed version,

54
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:29,430
you can use ROSA, which is
directly managed in partnership

55
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,350
with both Red Hat and AWS
as a platform that you run

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,900
to really like, minimize
all the operational overload

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,040
that you have to maintain to
have a successful platform.

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,143
That do comes with a lot of benefits.

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,580
For the actual developer itself,

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,600
it's a fully managed clusters,
takes a few minutes to build,

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,830
deploy your application,

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,410
come all with the great OpenShift toolings

63
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,710
that you're familiar with.

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,210
It allows a lot of teams to
calibrate on share projects

65
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,040
in the way that you're familiar with

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,100
all the OpenShift platforms
that comes with it.

67
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,590
All the experience of
the OpenShift platform.

68
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,260
For any stressors, more specifically,

69
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,090
it does provide a standardized

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,270
and very streamlined
operation across on-prem

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,560
and all the cloud environments

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,260
where you have OpenShift deployed.

73
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,510
Comes with built-in monitoring, logging

74
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,463
and all kind of networking options.

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,300
And basically you can easily
choose to upgrade your version

76
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,960
as you see fit in all
your OpenShift, you know,

77
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,690
across all your OpenShift deployment.

78
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,130
For specific leaders, that
brings in consolidated billings,

79
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,120
you do have visibility on
costs across the whole business

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,900
and basically the inside of AWS.

81
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,190
You do have consumption,

82
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,740
the consumption is actually based, sorry,

83
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,780
the pricing is actually
based on consumption,

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,000
so you can add and remove nodes,

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,240
even giving the regular EC2 pricing

86
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,750
as well as the ROSA specific pricing.

87
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,933
It does come with a 99.95% SLA,

88
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,830
basically 24/7 hours monitoring

89
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,560
by both Red Hat and AWS teams.

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
But on top of this, it
allows you to use the breadth

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,620
and depth of all the AWS services

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,640
to augment the capability of your cluster.

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,870
So, if you wanna store files in S3

94
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,660
in to database offering, one
of the RDS managed database,

95
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,230
for example, you can do
so directly from ROSA.

96
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,110
You can use the IAM role
to attach the workloads

97
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,640
to those services.

98
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,490
So, it really give a lot of flexibility

99
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,880
into having your workloads in the cloud

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,730
in a managed platform,
managed OpenShift platform,

101
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,990
but still use all the
benefit of managed services

102
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,490
that AWS does (clears throat).

103
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,480
So, in a nutshell, right, this
is really a joint offering.

104
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,450
So, you have the regular
OpenShift Container Platform

105
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,140
where you and Red Hat are
responsible for most of the thing.

106
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,640
And as you move into the cloud,

107
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,330
you can deploy your own
OpenShift platform on EC2.

108
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,420
You're still responsible for
most of the aspect of it.

109
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,420
But with ROSA there is
really a simplified platform

110
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,990
where management and supports
is a joint effort by Red Hat

111
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,990
and AWS, so that you can,
you know, move to build,

112
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,370
you know, the most important
feature for your business,

113
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,370
not have to worry about
maintaining the platform yourself.

114
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,990
Dan, you wanna talk about
a couple of other offering?

115
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,730
- Definitely, so I think it's great,

116
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,790
the fact that Red Hat and
AWS are working together.

117
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,190
Again, you are able like
to run it on self-managed

118
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,770
or if you want to actually
release the burden

119
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,240
of managing the cluster itself,

120
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,210
you're actually able to run
it into a managed solution

121
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,610
where Red Hat and AWS are working together

122
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,650
to make sure that you have a great uptime

123
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,510
and you have like the
best of the platform,

124
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,630
the Kubernetes platform.

125
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,780
Again, Math spoke a lot
about the integration

126
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,030
with the different AWS offering,

127
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,280
but we also, like what's
great in marketplace,

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,860
you can actually get all the
offerings from Red Hat directly

129
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,180
from the marketplace.

130
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,290
So, you're actually able to
procure them, subscribe, deploy,

131
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,110
and manage them through the
console of the marketplace,

132
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,700
which is something that is very good.

133
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,590
We spoke about earlier about ROSA,

134
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,240
but again, there's a lot more,

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,850
there's gonna be Red
Hat Enterprise Linux AI,

136
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,280
we're able to run Red Hat
OpenShift virtualization

137
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,430
in the cloud or different offerings

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,290
as Red Hat Automation Platform

139
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,840
that can actually control
on-prem and in the cloud.

140
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,480
Earlier this year at the Red Hat Summit,

141
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,940
we actually had CAE as our main presenter

142
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,880
and they actually won the
Red Hat Innovation Award.

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,710
And the reason why they won it,

144
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,470
it was for the advancements
that they did with OpenShift

145
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,150
and the Red Hat products.

146
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,550
Some of them was around like
running mission criticals

147
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,100
applications that actually
allow airplanes to take off

148
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,420
every five seconds.

149
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,660
So, by now about hundred
or more airplanes took off

150
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,300
just in the few minutes that we spoke.

151
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,090
The other stuff was around
for them like to innovate

152
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,350
in their simulators.

153
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,350
So what CAE did, they actually
are running Red Hat OpenShift

154
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
inside their simulators.

155
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,140
So those big simulators
that everybody like trains

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,940
or the pilots are training on them,

157
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,330
they're actually powered by OpenShift.

158
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,400
The geek inside me loves the fact

159
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,610
that it's like low latency,
it's one platform and so on.

160
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,940
But for CIOs and CEOs,

161
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,730
what actually they like, it's
that they're able to have one

162
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,800
platform that they can
evolve on top of it.

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,480
Whatever they wanna run, VMs,
containers or AI workloads.

164
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,760
So that allows for them to have a platform

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,500
that can evolve over time

166
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,230
and they can actually
provide to the end customer

167
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,240
the resources that are needed.

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,010
Also, something that is very important

169
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,050
is the fact that they're
gonna be able to connect them

170
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,280
together or in order to
reduce the operational risk

171
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,073
and the cost associated with that one.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
So without further ado, I'll
pass it over to Jean-Francois

173
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,060
to kinda talk about how
he's keeping aviation safe

174
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,030
and how he partnered with AWS and Red Hat.

175
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,930
Thank you.
- Thank you guys.

176
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,763
- No problem.

177
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,663
- First, just to set up
the context a little bit.

178
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,830
See every time you fly,

179
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,920
every time you step on an aircraft

180
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,723
for business or for pleasure,

181
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,150
there's a big chance that
the pilot trained with us.

182
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,150
We are the largest training
service provider worldwide

183
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,880
for civil aviation and
we extend our services

184
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,170
and our applications
to the defense as well.

185
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,170
Basically, we train more than
150,000 pilots every year.

186
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,320
We manage all the applications.

187
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,280
So we work with the OEMs, we
work with all the airlines,

188
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,143
we work with the pilots to
make the aviation world safer.

189
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,710
So we prepare in the training,

190
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,700
the pilots for the moment that matters.

191
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,740
So in case of an incident

192
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,740
or in case of something that
can happen, they are ready

193
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,293
to respond the right way to that incident.

194
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,820
In addition, we are a global company,

195
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,880
so we train worldwide

196
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,880
in more than 85 sites
in different countries.

197
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,830
That increases the
complexity of those workloads

198
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,080
and those operations.

199
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,790
We also control and operate
the entire value chain

200
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,170
from RND to supply
chain, to manufacturing,

201
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,040
to the training centers,
booking, scheduling

202
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,880
with the pilots, with the
operators, with the instructors,

203
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,743
so the entire value chain.

204
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,710
And more importantly,

205
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,070
we are building everything
from almost from the ground up.

206
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,870
Everything.

207
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,400
So, we have a community of 3000 developers

208
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,070
and that's the reason why I'm here today.

209
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,070
I want to congratulate them for the award

210
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,740
and also thank the partnership
that we are having with AWS

211
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,653
and Red Hat in this journey.

212
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,540
I'm just gonna show you a little video

213
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,603
to show you the magnitude
of the operations.

214
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,850
- [Narrator] At CAE,

215
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,313
our purpose is to make the world safer.

216
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,570
From pilots flying us, to the
people we can't wait to see,

217
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,393
to defense forces
safeguarding what we cherish.

218
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,300
We are proud to be the partner of choice

219
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,750
for those operating in the
most complex environments.

220
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,510
In civil aviation and
defense and security,

221
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,240
we are unleashing the power
of technology to equip people

222
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,440
to perform at their best
when the stakes are highest.

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,663
Our commitment is unwavering.

224
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,460
Around the globe, we're
everywhere you need us to be.

225
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,930
Providing cutting edge training

226
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,910
and critical operation solutions

227
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,501
that enhance human
performance and efficiency.

228
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:35,010
(dramatic music)

229
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,110
We build next generation technology

230
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,683
with a shared common purpose,
shaping a better future.

231
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,280
We are committed to
our customer's success,

232
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,710
to our planet's sustainable future

233
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,633
and to our people's aspirations.

234
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,030
It's an ambitious mission,
but we never compromise.

235
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,040
Our focus remains on revolutionizing

236
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,903
how we will deliver safety for all.

237
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,040
Today and tomorrow.

238
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,150
We'll make sure you're ready
for the moments that matter.

239
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,900
(dramatic music)

240
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,370
- As you can see here,
the aviation industry

241
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,770
is working really hard as a whole

242
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,100
in order to make sure
that the transportation,

243
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,660
the aviation transportation
mode is the safest mode.

244
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,553
By far, it is by far.

245
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,110
Everybody contributes
to this accomplishment

246
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,110
but we think that we
play a big role in this.

247
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,770
We contribute a lot in
this accomplishment.

248
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,493
So as you can see, it's safe to fly.

249
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,510
Concerning CAE, we've been innovating

250
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,710
for the last more than 75 years.

251
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,710
So it's more than eight decades
where we catched tech waves,

252
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,730
one after the other.

253
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,090
And also where we transformed the company

254
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,900
across different business
operating models.

255
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,600
We started as a manufacturing company

256
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,260
and now we are in training
services, recurring services

257
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,690
for pilots worldwide.

258
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,370
And now it's time to think
about the next tech wave.

259
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,590
And this is our big concern.

260
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,590
The tech wave that is coming
in is an important one with AI

261
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,900
and we need to be ready
to catch this next wave.

262
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Also, in addition to the
complexity that I've just described

263
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,950
in terms of operations,
in terms of services

264
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,490
and in terms of critical operations

265
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,960
and the big mission that we
have, to make the world safer.

266
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,550
We see that the industry is
growing, is growing fast.

267
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,750
More passengers, but also
the demand in pilot training

268
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,453
is growing in the next few years.

269
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,530
By 2024, we're gonna have
more than 2.4x more pilots

270
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,243
to train, than we train actually today.

271
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,280
This is because some people
will go in retirement

272
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,433
and also the demand is growing.

273
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,400
So it needs scales.

274
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,200
But in addition to that,

275
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
we see that the customers
expectations are growing

276
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,690
because of the applications
they are used to every day.

277
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,200
Prediction, customization,
personalization.

278
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,490
So it's everywhere.

279
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,370
So the expectations are high

280
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,450
and also the complexity of the
technology is always growing

281
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,623
for the developers.

282
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,453
In addition to that, we
have more compliance issues.

283
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,343
Regulation is growing,
compliances are growing,

284
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,480
we have pressure to reduce costs

285
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,030
and increase the quality at the same time.

286
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,453
The same as the other industries.

287
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,390
So, the status quo is not an option.

288
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,830
We absolutely need to change
the way we work all the time.

289
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,010
That has been the case
for the last 80 years.

290
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,210
But right now things evolves
faster with data and AI

291
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,250
and the technology evolves faster.

292
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,223
So the status quo doesn't exist anymore.

293
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,090
And we think that we can't
evolve in an incremental way.

294
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,853
We need to disrupt ourself.

295
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,930
If we don't disrupt yourself
and catch the next wave,

296
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,120
other companies will do.

297
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,450
So that's important to
reinvent the way we work

298
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,380
all the time.

299
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,060
And for this we develop
four basic capabilities

300
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,470
inside the business.

301
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,980
One is on the technology side,
so that's why we are here

302
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,410
with AWS and Red Hat.

303
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,400
We build tech capabilities
in order to go faster

304
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,900
and to innovate more

305
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,430
and to increase the tech
intensity that we have

306
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,180
with the developers

307
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,140
and the capacity that they
have to try something,

308
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,290
learn from this and innovate.

309
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,340
On the other side, it's super important

310
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,800
to change the way we work.

311
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,780
So the operational model,

312
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,550
the operating model is very,
very key in this thing.

313
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,140
It's not just about technology,

314
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,603
but it's also about the culture.

315
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,440
We've been a company based
on projects operating model

316
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,300
and the more we evolve,

317
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,770
we implement a product operating model

318
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,543
which bring more innovation
and a new mindset.

319
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,794
Culture, talent, we need to adjust also.

320
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:27,794
We are working super
hard to upskill our staff

321
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,460
with the new technology.

322
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,720
The technology right now are
evolving very, very fast.

323
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,610
And of course, I think one
of the or the most important

324
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,720
point, the most important
capacity, capability is the data.

325
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,800
Data, AI capability,
maybe foundational model

326
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,793
that we need to build
internally to boost our AI.

327
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,940
Here it's more the same thing.

328
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,940
What we foresee for the next
wave in terms of technology.

329
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,400
So we modernized in the
twenties with AWS, the cloud.

330
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,820
So that was an important
innovation vector.

331
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,263
Going in the cloud allowed us
to remove lots of tech depth.

332
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,200
With 75 years of legacy, of
course you need to work a lot

333
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,423
on the tech depth.

334
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,610
We also consolidate on
one unique platform,

335
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,520
a smarter platform, OpenShift,

336
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,960
that allowed us to deploy
everywhere the same way.

337
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,980
And it connects also the developers

338
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,080
with platform engineering,

339
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,940
with the complexity of the technology.

340
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,700
So we absolutely want to have a layer

341
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,780
that abstract the complexity from the devs

342
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,780
and to make sure that they can focus

343
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,643
only on the domain problems.

344
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,010
The next wave is gonna be
more about AI and data.

345
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,010
And as you can see here, we
leverage already OpenShift AI

346
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,693
to deploy AI everywhere.

347
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,873
On the Edge as well on the sim.

348
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,640
That's the kind of
infrastructure that shows

349
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,170
at super high level.

350
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,320
The kind of infrastructure
that we have at CAE.

351
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,780
So it's very, very global.

352
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,780
We have eight cloud regions
to be closer to our customers.

353
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,550
We leverage OpenShift everywhere,

354
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:58,550
so we can deploy across the
entire spectrum of targets

355
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,213
the same way.

356
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:08,100
So that's one of the reason
we selected the Red Hat

357
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,440
because it's not just on the cloud.

358
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,890
We want to have the same
experience on the cloud,

359
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,823
on the data center and also on
the Edge, on the simulators.

360
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,030
And the more and more we
deployed the AI models

361
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,383
everywhere as well.

362
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,483
One thing that you can see here,

363
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,280
the more we go, an important
aspect is to manage

364
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,233
all the assets that we have
across the entire ecosystem.

365
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,450
So this is gonna give us
a capacity to optimize

366
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,980
all the different processes.

367
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,780
We have data from all
the different regions,

368
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,610
from all the different devices.

369
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,340
So we have data that is
coming from everywhere

370
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,080
in the process.

371
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
I said previously that
we control and operate

372
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,810
the entire value chain.

373
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,750
So we have data stream
coming from everywhere

374
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,050
and we're gonna leverage this
to optimize the operations

375
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,710
and optimize the cost, the
quality and the efficiency

376
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,733
of what we do.

377
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,380
AI is not, AI and the
platform is not just changing

378
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,910
the way, the experience,
the customer experience,

379
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,910
but it is also changing
and evolving the experience

380
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,753
the developers are having.

381
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,500
We build a product, a
platform engineering product

382
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,320
with a team and that
consolidate and standardizes

383
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,380
the way all the developers
are working at CAE

384
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,263
in the different product teams.

385
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,540
We have multiple product teams
that are cross-functional

386
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,880
in three continents

387
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,870
and we absolutely want them
to have some guardrails

388
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,813
in order to standardize the way they work.

389
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,380
The more...

390
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,380
It's self-service, it's a
self-service application.

391
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,210
It comes with DevOp as well

392
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
on which they can discover their APIs,

393
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,520
discover their building blocks,
discover the CICD templates.

394
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,393
And this fast track all the operations.

395
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,510
This is a set of best practices

396
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,953
and pave path that they
can use to go faster.

397
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,430
Right now there's a big shift
in the platform engineering,

398
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,413
and this is powered by AI.

399
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,480
It had a huge evolution last year

400
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,840
with the different
platforms that we are using.

401
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,530
It helps us to not just remove tech depth

402
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,530
in the different
applications that we support,

403
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,690
but also generating code.

404
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,670
Almost 40% of the code that we produce now

405
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,993
in some cases is generated by AI,

406
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,890
but testing improve the PR,
improve the quality of the code

407
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,940
and in top of that it helps us to remove,

408
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,990
to increase the cybersecurity
ability management.

409
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,380
So that's something that
boosts the experience

410
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,483
with the engineering teams.

411
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,210
At the same time, I
think it's a big factor

412
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,970
to increase the tech intensity.

413
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,330
We have a platform, we
have lots of goodness

414
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,650
that is coming from all the
services provided by the clouds

415
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,413
and all the different
other tools that we have,

416
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:16,250
but we needed a way to facilitate
the access to those tools

417
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,443
and those capabilities for the engineers.

418
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,550
So that's what we do with this platform.

419
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,307
On top of that, as I said,
the AI is the next big thing.

420
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,560
It's our big mandate right now

421
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,930
to boost the customer experience

422
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,440
with more prediction,
more personalization.

423
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,730
Improve the way the
customers interact with CAE.

424
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,370
Not just the customers but the operators

425
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,090
and also the instructors

426
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,430
and all the planners.

427
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,230
So we have multiple
personnels around the platform

428
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,850
and we need to help them
to accomplish their work.

429
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,553
And on the other side, we have
a big initiative right now

430
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,350
to improve and reinvent the
business operating models.

431
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:31,803
The key business operating processes.

432
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,393
So basically we start from
mapping the processes,

433
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,510
re-engineer all the processes

434
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,170
and see where we have
opportunities to inject AI

435
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,243
at the enterprise level.

436
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,010
As I said, it's a game
changer also for the employees

437
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,420
and this is gonna be implemented
as well in the product.

438
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,660
We discussed at the beginning
of the presentation,

439
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,983
Dan talked about what we're
doing for the simulators,

440
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,873
but we need to also make sure,

441
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,770
bring this device in the
agentic world and the AI world.

442
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,410
That's something that we do.

443
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,870
So we embed AI in the processes,

444
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,700
we embed AI in the customer
experience within the product

445
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,630
and also we empower the employees

446
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,493
and the developers with AI.

447
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,060
We access through the cloud

448
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,060
to more than 2000 standard
commercial models.

449
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,120
Lots of open source.

450
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,100
We want to innovate with open
source as much as we can,

451
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,790
but also we have access
to different models

452
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,723
and we're trying, we
are experimenting a lot.

453
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,910
Just to show you some
example of the kind of return

454
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,650
of an investment that we see

455
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,650
from dealing with this
technology with Red Hat, AWS.

456
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,960
In terms of...

457
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,543
So basically we see
benefits across the board,

458
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,470
but basically we see cost
reduction in the infrastructure.

459
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,890
We see more efficiency for the deployment

460
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,910
in the terms of quality,
in terms of frequency,

461
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,480
in terms of pace, deployment time as well.

462
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Up to 40%, it's more to
up to 40% more efficient

463
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,890
in terms of cost where we
implemented Red Hat OpenShift

464
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,930
for the infrastructure.

465
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,680
But deployment, which
is a measure that counts

466
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,820
even more for me because we can test more,

467
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,300
we can try more with the customers.

468
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,730
We increase the deployment,

469
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,913
we reduce the deployment time by a lot.

470
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,930
The deployment pace,
we are faster as well.

471
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,680
We do more and maybe more important,

472
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,770
the pull requests are more efficient.

473
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,693
So we do more with the devs.

474
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,030
So those are big numbers.

475
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,833
I think if we look at them
today, it's even more,

476
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,800
it's even better today.

477
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,573
But those are the numbers that
we had maybe 2-3 months ago.

478
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,533
We continuously improve.

479
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,253
An important thing that
I want to mention is,

480
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,130
I talked a lot about the culture

481
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,130
and I talked about our
culture and technology.

482
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,910
Our mixing is mixed together
to increase the way we work

483
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,280
and the way we innovate.

484
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,880
And I think it starts from there.

485
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,240
The innovation loop,
accelerating the innovation loop

486
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,653
or the creation loop.

487
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,450
So, we are using the
technology that we've discussed

488
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,450
in order to improve this innovation loop.

489
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,020
So it starts from, having more speed

490
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,260
is not just delivering more features

491
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,733
for the same amount of time.

492
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,590
For us, the speed is
more to try more things

493
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,240
to the full cycle, increase
the speed of the full cycle

494
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,650
with the customers.

495
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:00,650
Try more things with the
customers, add feedback very fast.

496
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,020
Feed that feedback into
the product decisions.

497
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,160
So that's the kind of
mindset that we have.

498
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,160
And we wanted a platform where
it's safe for the developers

499
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,240
to test and try, paint and to
get data from those testings.

500
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,900
So the way we see the platform

501
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,810
and the way we are using this technology

502
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,750
is a kind of a learning engine

503
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,303
where every time we test something,

504
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,890
it's an opportunity for
us to have data points.

505
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,413
And from there we improve the products.

506
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,340
So here you can see that we
are using all the AI tool

507
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,480
in order to improve the
code, the speed of the code.

508
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:02,490
OpenShift is helping also
to reduce the friction

509
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,670
that the developers are
having with the platforms.

510
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,103
So it automates a lot of things.

511
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,870
And all the deployment is
facilitate using those CICD

512
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,743
embedded tools within the platform.

513
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,930
We are using the cloud to
deploy in multiple regions

514
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,930
closer to the customers
doing deployment in range

515
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,320
to test something with customers
that are in a certain range

516
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,053
before deploying this at large.

517
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,070
And with the customers
we can scale, very fast.

518
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,090
We can have the reliability that we want

519
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,470
and have the experience that we expect.

520
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,960
So we are leveraging
all the different tools

521
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,210
and all the different platforms

522
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,723
in order to boost that innovation loop.

523
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,830
In the past, that's not the
operating model that we had.

524
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:15,260
We were working maybe a couple
of years ago in projects

525
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,870
and that doesn't work
right now in the industry

526
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,613
if you want to disrupt.

527
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:28,923
Another thing that we see.

528
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,860
We have 2,500 developers
across the planet.

529
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,260
And those are evolving,
technology is evolving.

530
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,200
We need to upskill those
people all the time.

531
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,003
So that's an important aspect as well.

532
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,268
We work with AWS and Red Hat

533
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:04,268
and we are asking the
devs in the community

534
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,240
to get their certifications,
go to the different courses.

535
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,090
So, we push a lot for this
adoption of the technology

536
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,300
and learning.

537
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,950
So we want them to adopt a growth mindset

538
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,300
and to develop their careers.

539
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,050
We empower them with the partners

540
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:36,050
in order to make sure that
they are on the edge for this.

541
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,120
So we develop also strong communities.

542
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,890
So with the devs is a,

543
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,560
the developers is a big community,

544
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,470
so it's not under the same thing.

545
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,470
But we manage this as
a group, if you want.

546
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,700
And that's a way for us,
the platform is a way for us

547
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,150
to make sure that we
standardize the way they work,

548
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,500
the way they learn.

549
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,790
We implemented the centers
of excellence as well.

550
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,320
And through partnership,

551
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,820
we make sure that they can have
access to the best courses,

552
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,820
learning and opportunities
to increase their knowledge.

553
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,891
(crowd clapping)

554
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,030
So that's a recap of this presentation

555
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,973
and how we are leveraging the platform.

556
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,960
So basically we have
75 years of experience

557
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,980
and the aviation is still
growing and evolving.

558
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,330
But at the same time, as I
said, we have other challenges.

559
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,570
Because the tech is more complex,

560
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,570
the regulations are growing as well

561
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,533
and the customer's expectation
are always increasing.

562
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,380
So we absolutely need to
change the way we work

563
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,920
all the time, we need to
change the technology,

564
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,550
we need to be ready to
adopt new technologies

565
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,143
and new mindsets.

566
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,310
And for this, as a foundation,

567
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,350
we are using a smart infrastructure

568
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,350
and we are leveraging data and AI

569
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,640
and also platform engineering
to increase the tech intensity

570
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,973
the devs can have with those technologies.

571
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,793
And as a result,

572
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,770
we expect that, right now, as
you've seen in the numbers,

573
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,790
we have very good accomplishments
in terms of safety

574
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,443
with the aviation industry.

575
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,430
But in terms of CAE,
our plan is to deliver

576
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,943
an integrated training
ecosystem, end to end.

577
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,543
Based on data, AI insights,

578
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,350
and bring our expertise to the customers

579
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,613
to deliver more outcomes.

580
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,403
Thank you.
