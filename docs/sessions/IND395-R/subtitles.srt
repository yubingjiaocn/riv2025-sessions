1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,620
(atmosphere humming softly)

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,730
- [Sam] All right.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,590
Hello, and welcome everyone.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,747
Make sure you're all in the
right room, this is IND395,

5
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,450
"Accelerating Game Design Reviews

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,850
with Generative AI and LLM Agents."

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,260
So, I am Sam Patzer, I'm a
Solution Architect at AWS,

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,030
and I'm joined here with Christina!

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,380
- [Christina] Hi everyone, I'm Christina,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,083
and I'm also a Solutions Architect at AWS.

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,680
- [Sam] So, I wanna just
ask the room a few questions

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,880
before we fully get started.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,313
Who here has ever built a game before?

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,680
Awesome, we got a few folks.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,293
All right, who here has
written a design doc before?

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,790
Requirements doc, whatever name
you wanna sign it, yep, yep.

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,140
All right, I see a lot more for folks,

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,340
all right, perfect, awesome.

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,900
Well today, we're gonna
kind of be reviewing

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,733
kind of how that maps

21
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,420
to some of the software
engineering practices

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,000
that you use, as well
as game design as well.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,340
So, let's take a look at our agenda.

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,290
First off, we're gonna
introduce to everyone

25
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,670
what is a game analyst.

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,570
What does that mean,

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,860
what does that mean to the industry?

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,440
And also how it maps back to
software engineering as well.

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,090
Then kind of we will go over

30
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,040
an overview of what are we building today.

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,740
We'll go into what tools are
we gonna use in our toolbox,

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,210
and then actually spend some time

33
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,950
doing some live coding for y'all.

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,040
After that, we'll have some
time hopefully for some Q&A.

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,840
If not, we'll also be outside
to answer any Q&A as well.

36
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,973
So, let's dive into what is
the role of a game analyst?

37
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,200
The modern game analyst
serves both an interpreter

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,490
and a storyteller.

39
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,390
What does that mean?

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,600
Well, it means that they are able to take

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,790
the business goals and the player goals

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,730
and map that back to a
story that they want to tell

43
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,230
across the industry.

44
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,380
So, they wanna translate
things like player data,

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,380
business data, QA, design
docs, everything else like that

46
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,460
into a boil down doc,

47
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,040
and their role is to be
able to translate any doc

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,900
into the those different areas,

49
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,760
and be able to give feedback on it.

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,160
So, for those that have written
requirement docs before,

51
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,440
usually, typically engineers are the ones

52
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,550
writing the requirements docs,

53
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,410
and then you have someone
else come in and review it.

54
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,323
Game analyst's job is to be
the reviewer of those docs.

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,890
So, for those that aren't
familiar with the game analyst,

56
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,810
we've broken it down
into four competencies.

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,420
The first one is focused on lore.

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,410
Lores, their entire idea is
to validate that this update

59
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,350
or this idea fits into the game itself.

60
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,000
So, think about like, oh,

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,480
if we're adding a new race
into "New World," for example,

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,250
which we'll be using later on as example,

63
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,240
we're gonna be adding elves,

64
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,940
does that fit the lore of "New World?"

65
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,880
Next, we're gonna be looking
at QA or Quality Assurance.

66
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,130
Does this break anything in the game?

67
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,350
Is it valid to be in
the game, does it break?

68
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,820
Is it a new powered item?

69
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,130
Does it break other play tests?

70
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,200
This common problem that
always has to be solved

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,380
to make sure evaluated when
you approach the problem.

72
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,780
Finally, or the next one is game design.

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,280
Is this update fun?

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
Do players want to
engage with this update?

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,260
Make sure that we design
and build this game

76
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,960
in such a way that players
keep coming back to our game.

77
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,670
And finally, game strategy.

78
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,680
Does this fit into our
business needs, right?

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Is this something that we
want to go forward and do

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,340
for business and strategy?

81
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,740
Does it fit like our
player retention models?

82
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,090
Does it bring new players in?

83
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,530
These are all questions
that the game analysts

84
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,180
should be able to answer as well.

85
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,880
With that, there's a lot
of current challenges

86
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,470
that have to happen with this.

87
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,180
The first one is slow duration.

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,750
During the back and forth
process of that early proposal,

89
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,920
there could be a lot of back and forth

90
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,590
due to incomplete information
that's unavailable.

91
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,690
The designers don't have
access to the same data sources

92
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,680
as the analysts do.

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,550
For example, the analysts might have docs

94
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,190
around the strategy that the
game designers might not have,

95
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,400
and they might know more
than the actual designers.

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,600
Finally, to take a game
analyst to available to be able

97
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,210
to review docs, it takes a
lot of time for them to learn

98
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,280
how to be able to review these docs.

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,170
So, everything from
learning knowledge about

100
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,970
what the game is, learning how,

101
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,740
what the content of that game is gonna be,

102
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,940
and all the different silos,

103
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,880
what we talked about previously,
as well as best practices

104
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,040
and methodologies for
reviewing those docs.

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,960
It takes a lot of time and energy

106
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,090
to bring someone up to speed.

107
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,210
And then finally, subjective,
feedback, bias do exist.

108
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,400
And so, when you have someone come,

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,710
and for example, review
a doc for "New World,"

110
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,280
they might review that
like, "Oh, this new edition

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
is not good for the game
because I'm a purist and I think

112
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,240
that all new updates are bad."

113
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,750
And that might influence their
decision-making to be bad.

114
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,640
Or if you're ever been in a design review

115
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,410
and someone is like, has the opinion about

116
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,180
what code language should be written in,

117
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,160
when objectively,
something else is better,

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,890
that's a bias that they're
bringing into that doc review.

119
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,810
So that's kind of what we're looking at

120
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,300
when you get that subjective feedback.

121
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,280
So, how are we gonna build it today?

122
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Well, we're gonna first start off

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,760
by building four different
specialized agents.

124
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,120
These agents, their purpose
is to only evaluate the doc

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,130
that we're providing, and it's the lens.

126
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,880
So, for example, with lore
doc, it's only viewing that doc

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,410
from the lore perspective.

128
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,990
So that means is that we're
not taking consideration

129
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,570
our strategy, we're not taking
consideration our gameplay,

130
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,760
we're just taking
consideration of our lore.

131
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,410
And we're gonna do that
for every single bot.

132
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,180
Its whole purpose is to evaluate

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,730
that project with that idea.

134
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,350
And with that, we want to connect it

135
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,340
to different knowledge bases.

136
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,530
These different knowledge
bases contain a lot of detail

137
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,340
around how that lore exists
or that gameplay exists,

138
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,470
and it's gonna be very well
specialized in that area.

139
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,580
For example, with lore,

140
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,400
we have the entire "New
World" Wiki loaded into it,

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,870
which contains all the different knowledge

142
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,643
around "New World" inside of it.

143
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,270
After we have all these
bots, review those docs,

144
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,010
we then use an Orchestrator Agent,

145
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,900
which is the Game Analyst Agent

146
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,820
that then reviews the entire summary

147
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,670
and decides how it presented
back to the customer.

148
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,820
While the elves might
exist as a great solution

149
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,567
for the strategy doc, lore
it's against the lore overall.

150
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,550
And so, it has to evaluate

151
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,980
how do we evaluate strategy versus lore?

152
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,510
And there's different
ways to approach that,

153
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,510
and lore can then provide
feedback on how to do that better.

154
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,150
So, some of the benefits
behind this is that

155
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,680
we get an accelerated innovation cycle

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,513
because of the fact that

157
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:58,350
we're continuously chatting with bots,

158
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,560
identifying how we can spin
up things like, for example,

159
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,920
solve the lore problem or
solve the strategy problem.

160
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,360
We are getting collaborative intelligence

161
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,210
by having these bots work
together to be able to identify

162
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,100
different areas and different gaps.

163
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,420
And finally, it's unbiased, right?

164
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,470
You're literally reviewing

165
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,120
the information right from the source.

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,350
There is no bias saying that,

167
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,910
hey, I prefer this or I prefer this.

168
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,200
No, it's just straight from the source

169
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,450
on the knowledge base,
and it's pulling those in.

170
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,790
So, with all that, let's
take a look at our toolbox

171
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,823
to understand how we're
gonna build this layout.

172
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,600
- Alright, so we have the
what we're gonna build.

173
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,280
Now, I wanna talk about

174
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,430
how we can take this idea
and make it into a reality.

175
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,900
And we can do this by using
a few different tools.

176
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,550
Who here has heard about Strands?

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,550
Yeah, so Strands is our
open source framework

178
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,383
that is designed for
building agentic agents.

179
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,820
AI agents for

180
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,320
agentic applications.

181
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,200
It was designed, it's an
open source Python SDK

182
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,390
that was designed for ease of use.

183
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,760
So, you don't have to spend a ton of time

184
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,280
just trying to understand
how to use the framework.

185
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,690
It's supposed to be intuitive

186
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,690
so that you can get started
quickly for rapid prototyping.

187
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,520
It has seamless integration

188
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,980
with tools such as MCP servers.

189
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,410
How many of y'all had the chance

190
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,213
to use MCP servers before?

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,740
So yeah, you can use MCP
servers, you can have,

192
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,880
and it even is built

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,540
to be seamlessly integrated
with AWS services.

194
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,390
It was also designed to be flexible,

195
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,960
providing you with choice
of models and tools

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,953
that you can use.

197
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,030
The next tool we're gonna be using

198
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,520
is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

199
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is a
agentic platform for building,

200
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,210
deploying, and operating
AI agents at scale

201
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,323
in production ready.

202
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,240
AgentCore comes with a suite of services.

203
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,180
The ones that we're gonna be
specifically covering today

204
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,240
include Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime,

205
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,410
which provides you with a
serverless hosting environment

206
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,130
for deploying and running
your agents on AWS

207
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,250
without having to manage
the complex infrastructure

208
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,550
that comes with agentic applications.

209
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,910
Additionally, we can enhance our agents

210
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,780
and make them context-aware
using AgentCore Memories,

211
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,770
which provides you

212
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,190
with a fully-managed memory infrastructure

213
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,710
for your context-aware agents.

214
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,520
And finally, for tracing and debugging,

215
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,170
we have Amazon Bedrock
AgentCore Observability,

216
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,150
which provides you a unified dashboard

217
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,540
where you can see all the
things such as traces.

218
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,500
So, you can figure out

219
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,510
the root causes of any of those errors

220
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,840
that usually takes a really
long time to find. (chuckling)

221
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,150
And then additionally, we can have,

222
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,530
we can see performance metrics

223
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,900
to see how well our agents are performing.

224
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,660
But you're not just limited to these tools

225
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,500
in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,
there are many other services

226
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,980
that you can bring into your workflow

227
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,980
to further increase the
capabilities of your agents.

228
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,700
So, just to list a few of them,

229
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,240
we have identity where
you can bring identity

230
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,130
and access management into your agents,

231
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,360
and even integrate them

232
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,090
with your own existing identity providers.

233
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,350
We have a code interpreter

234
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,820
for securely executing code
in a sandbox environment,

235
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,370
as well as browser capabilities.

236
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,850
And we have the AgentCore
gateway so that you can take

237
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,430
your existing APIs and Lambda functions,

238
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,190
and make them into MCP compatible tools,

239
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,333
pretty cool, right?

240
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,400
So, now that we've talked about
the tools, let's talk about

241
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,140
how we're gonna string these all together

242
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,600
to build our agentic solution.

243
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,193
So, how do I do the?

244
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,900
- [Participant] The laser button.

245
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,040
- [Christina] Laser button, all right.

246
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
Sorry guys.

247
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,930
So, to start off, we're gonna have

248
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,600
five different agents that
we're gonna be building.

249
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,920
And we can break these

250
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,990
into two different types of categories.

251
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,270
We're gonna have our specialized agents,

252
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,000
these are gonna be representing
our core competencies

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,890
that a game analyst would need.

254
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,070
So, we have a lore agent,
a quality assurance agent,

255
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,650
a gameplay agent, and a strategy agent.

256
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,500
And then, as our like main director,

257
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,960
we have our Orchestrator Agent,

258
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,990
and that is gonna be our game analyst.

259
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,720
The first AWS service that
we're gonna be leveraging,

260
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,530
well first actually, I'm
getting ahead of myself.

261
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,200
These agents are all gonna be written

262
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,390
with the Strands framework.

263
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,910
And the model that we're
gonna be using today

264
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,020
is we're gonna be using

265
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,413
the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 model.

266
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,310
With that, we're gonna
have all of these agents

267
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,270
are gonna be deployed

268
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,303
to their own Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Runtime.

269
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,010
And then with that, each of our agents,

270
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,840
they're gonna need to have access

271
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,990
to various different data sources.

272
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,120
We have our game design documents

273
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,010
and business strategy documents.

274
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,530
These are gonna be stored
an Amazon S3 bucket.

275
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,750
And then, we also have
player behavior data

276
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,800
which could be stored

277
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,950
in maybe an Amazon
Redshift data warehouse.

278
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,250
With that, we're gonna
provide RAG capabilities.

279
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,730
Since this is at the basic

280
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,210
level, this is still a RAG
application because we need to go

281
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,540
and query data from our data sources.

282
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,250
And so with that, we're gonna use

283
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,050
the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases,

284
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,293
how many of you all have
used that one before?

285
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,490
So, it's a really cool tool

286
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,450
because you can bring
basically your enterprise data

287
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,060
into your AI applications

288
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,860
in a very

289
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,330
easy way.

290
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,710
It provides you with the
ability to easily integrate

291
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,850
your AWS services

292
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,860
and make them into a vector data store.

293
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,630
And it does all the indexing for you.

294
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,060
It's a really good tool.

295
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,270
And so, we have all of these data sources,

296
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,600
youth leveraging Amazon
Bedrock Knowledge Bases,

297
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,560
and to provide us with our
standardized way for our agents

298
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,620
to be able to access these data sources,

299
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,140
we're gonna be leveraging an MCP server.

300
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,430
This one is specifically
designed by AWS for the demo,

301
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,120
and it's called the AWS Labs
Knowledge Base Retrieval.

302
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,670
And we're gonna be using that today

303
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,463
for interacting with these data sources.

304
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,870
And then finally, in order to provide

305
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,200
a better performance with our agents

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,100
and also a more personalized
experience for our users,

307
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,210
we're gonna be leveraging,

308
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,670
we're gonna make these
agents memory enabled

309
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,940
by leveraging the Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Memory.

310
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,860
So for this, we're gonna have,

311
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,703
we can break our Memories up
into two different levels.

312
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,310
You'll see a little bit, this will make

313
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,230
a little bit more sense
when you see the demo.

314
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,740
But we're gonna have our
project-based memories,

315
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,440
and these are gonna be semantic facts.

316
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,140
And so, each of these agent runtimes

317
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,240
are gonna have their own set of facts

318
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,500
that they're gonna think about it

319
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,750
like as they're going
through their knowledge base,

320
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,300
they're gonna learn things about the data.

321
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,700
And so with that,

322
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,960
what the idea is,

323
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,380
we can make the performance
better because we can reduce

324
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,860
how often the agent goes all the way back

325
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,570
to the knowledge base
to retrieve information,

326
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,810
so over time, it'll get faster
and better at responding.

327
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,600
And then, at the user facing level,

328
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,160
we have our game analyst, right?

329
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,280
And so, we have two
different types of memory

330
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,570
that we can add here.

331
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,700
One is user preferences.

332
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,790
This can make the
experience better for users

333
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,410
by saving preferences

334
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,350
about that user.

335
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,590
For example, let's say
someone prefers having

336
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,770
bullet points in the responses
over paragraph forms.

337
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,810
You can have the agent remember that

338
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,870
so that it only is producing the outputs

339
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,420
that the responses in bullet points.

340
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,340
Additionally, we want the agent

341
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,340
to have awareness of
previous conversations.

342
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,760
And with that, we can
also add a session memory

343
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,473
to continue to,

344
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,360
so like in the case,

345
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,460
let's say someone gets disconnected,

346
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,590
they don't have to start the
conversation all over again,

347
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,380
or they can even refer to
like a previous conversation.

348
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,250
So, you have a more seamless
kind of interaction with it.

349
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,510
And then finally, throughout
this entire build process,

350
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,900
we leverage the Amazon Bedrock
AgentCore Observability

351
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,690
for all tracing and debugging,

352
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,530
and also monitoring the
performance of our agents.

353
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,150
All right?

354
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,080
I know that was a lot,

355
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,790
now we're gonna get to see that in action.

356
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,220
So, I'm gonna pass it on to you, Sam.

357
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,480
- [Sam] Perfect, all right.

358
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,660
Let's get this machine
up real quick, all right.

359
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,773
Go ahead and put demo.

360
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,180
Alright, so first off, we're
we're have a project portal

361
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,160
that we've created for this demo today.

362
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,993
This project portal,

363
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,680
we're gonna be demonstrating
all the different agents

364
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,170
and the different stages that
she kind of talked about here.

365
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,910
As I alluded, the first
thing we have to build

366
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,100
is obviously all the
different specialized agents.

367
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,200
So, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create a new project.

368
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,020
This project is referenced
throughout the entire thing,

369
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,390
and the idea behind it is
that, as we talked about before

370
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,090
with the Memories, these
projects are all different silos

371
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,770
inside the actual project.

372
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,680
So, I've already pre-populated
some of the fields in here.

373
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,180
We're gonna be doing kind of the example

374
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,410
I referred to before.

375
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,460
We're gonna be adding elves

376
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,280
into our "New World" experience today.

377
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,630
For those that haven't played "New World,"

378
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,840
it's one of Amazon's MMOs
that really focus in on

379
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,790
like a human during the medieval time.

380
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,950
So, elves should not fit that well

381
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,230
and we'll see some
examples of that later on.

382
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,700
So, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go down here

383
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,930
to the document for analysis.

384
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,190
I've already prepared a document,

385
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,190
I'll show that off to
y'all here real quick.

386
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,090
And inside this document,
you'll see we have

387
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,110
some different core features

388
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,430
that we are gonna be implementing.

389
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,690
Things like some
characteristics for the elves,

390
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,860
some cultural background,

391
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,433
just like a little brief thing about lore,

392
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,920
and some racial abilities

393
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,410
that come with being an elf as well.

394
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,210
Finally, there's some
customization options,

395
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,340
some technical requirements,
and a timeline.

396
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,560
For those that have ever
written requirements docs,

397
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,880
this is missing a lot of details,

398
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,300
and this should not pass
any someone's kind of bar

399
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,530
for running a doc.

400
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,933
But that's what we're gonna show today.

401
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:27,030
Is that this was obviously
not a well-written doc,

402
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,800
but that was the whole purpose
behind writing this doc

403
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,750
was just to show, hey!

404
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,330
I'm a brand new game designer,
I don't know what I'm doing.

405
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,800
Tell me how I can prove this doc.

406
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,360
So, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead

407
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,180
and copy this on over
to our wonderful tool

408
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,520
that we have over here
where we create a project.

409
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,870
And then we're gonna be prompted

410
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,270
with our agent configuration.

411
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,910
With us building out each
individual agent separately,

412
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,800
we've actually given
ourselves the power to be able

413
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,470
to select how we want to send
this document to the agents.

414
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,510
If, for example, I
already know my strategy

415
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,550
is a great strategy, we
don't want our strategy

416
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,480
to be evaluated,

417
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,127
or if we know more than
whatever else, we can just say,

418
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,250
"Hey, don't use that tool!

419
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,083
Don't enable it!"

420
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,920
So for this, for the demo today,

421
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,620
we're gonna start off
with removing analyst,

422
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,580
and we're gonna send it to

423
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,680
all three different agents individually.

424
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,690
We've also disabled
memory to kind of give us

425
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,280
an idea of what the performance looks like

426
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,230
without using any memory at all.

427
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,550
So, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead

428
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,470
and create that project.

429
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,480
And then with some demo
magic, instead of waiting

430
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,060
for this wonderful thing to
respond, I'm gonna hop on

431
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,100
over to our first page.

432
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,440
What we have over here is a overview.

433
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,180
The first thing it does
is it will send over

434
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,030
the entire doc we have over
to each one of our agents,

435
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,430
and each agent will automatically respond

436
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,340
with a detailed overview
of what it thinks about

437
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,110
our strategy doc.

438
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,840
And inside here, we can
then filter by gameplay,

439
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,890
lore and strategic,

440
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,750
these are all the separate bot overviews,

441
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,610
and it'll give us information around

442
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,110
how it feels it should fit.

443
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,100
So, let me scroll down a little bit

444
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,420
so y'all can see that!

445
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,590
It'll give us some details

446
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,240
and tell us things that we want to see.

447
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,630
For example, in the
gameplay it says, oh look,

448
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,850
there's some unprecedented
mechanics that I've added.

449
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,930
Well, that's not probably great

450
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,510
for other parts of the
gameplay, like for example, PVP,

451
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,193
it might introduce bad things.

452
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,590
Inside the faction system,

453
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,810
it might be hard to integrate,
and so on and so forth.

454
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,360
It gives us a whole overview
of all the different areas

455
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,213
that the gameplay might be
impacted by the strategy doc.

456
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,900
We're gonna do the same thing
and see that also in lore.

457
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,280
But one of the things that
interesting about lore

458
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,400
is that lore, we definitely
did not at all follow

459
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,450
the lore inside of "New World."

460
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,310
So, it's gonna call out
a lot of bad things.

461
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,040
Being like, ooh, this is bad no good.

462
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,910
And it's gonna go over

463
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,190
and say that this is just a bad update.

464
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,450
But then we go into strategic,

465
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,390
and strategic's like,
hmm, this is pretty good!

466
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,650
But then see that as the problem,

467
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,020
is that strategic likes
this, but lore does not.

468
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,820
And how do we combine all those together

469
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,900
and make sure that they're all valid?

470
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,340
And we're gonna get into
that a little later.

471
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,437
But first, I'm gonna hand off to Christina

472
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:50,121
and talk about how we built
these individual bots ourselves.

473
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,219
- [Christina] All right!

474
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,620
(mic shuffling)

475
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,260
Alright, so all of this.

476
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,310
So, I have our IDE open,
this is our lovely Kiro

477
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,230
that we just came out with.

478
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,740
How many of y'all had a chance
to play around with it yet?

479
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,080
Yeah, I really like this one.

480
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,353
So, let me make sure that
I open the right one.

481
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,020
So, we're gonna talk

482
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,710
about how to start
building our first agent.

483
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,640
And for this one,

484
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,490
we're gonna be looking
at the gameplay agent!

485
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,310
So, at a basic level, when you're building

486
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,150
an agent with Strands, there
are three key components

487
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,790
that are specific to a Strands agent.

488
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,850
You're gonna have tools,
you're gonna have a model,

489
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,750
and you're gonna have a system prompt.

490
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,390
Tools are gonna be things like,

491
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,190
they can either be custom tools,

492
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,920
that can be created through
like custom logic with like,

493
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,950
think like a function in a
class or something like that.

494
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,700
And it's designated with a tool decorator,

495
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,290
which you'll see in a little bit.

496
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,580
Or, tools can also be your MCP
servers that you want to use.

497
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,850
For this code, we're gonna
be actually leveraging,

498
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,800
we're gonna be leveraging the MCP server

499
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,610
for the Bedrock Knowledge
Base retrieval MCP server

500
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,650
that I alluded to earlier.

501
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,500
And so, we can see here, that

502
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,320
we have, basically what we'll do

503
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,120
is we would initialize the tool

504
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,090
by initializing a MCP client,

505
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,470
and then we would state which
MCP server we wanna use.

506
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,540
For this specific MCP server,

507
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,510
we have a few environmental variables

508
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,730
that you can enable.

509
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,350
For this one, we wanted to be able to

510
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,290
increase the accuracy of our

511
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,150
RAG process, and so we
have re-ranking enabled.

512
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,330
And then, the other piece we
have is an inclusion tag key,

513
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,080
because basically, the way
that this MCP server works

514
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,900
is you will tag your resource

515
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,050
with a specific tag that
you can define to say

516
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,390
this is part of my grouping for,

517
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,300
like what I want my agent
to be able to have access to

518
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,703
for querying using this MCP server.

519
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,140
For our model,

520
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,820
we have it up here,

521
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,660
and it is defined that we're
using the Amazon Bedrock model,

522
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,570
and we just have the model ID here.

523
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,940
And then, what I would say probably

524
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,730
the most important piece of
this entire thing, and I'm gonna

525
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,700
make this a little bit wider
for you, is this system prompt.

526
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,340
This system prompt is basically like,

527
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,450
think of this as like
the brain of your agent.

528
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,290
It's gonna define its personality,
it's gonna have its role

529
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,770
and instructions on how
it retrieves information,

530
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,300
and leverages their tools

531
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,580
and what kind of questions it can answer.

532
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,510
Most of the time,

533
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,620
when working with AI
applications like this,

534
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,330
when you're using foundation models,

535
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,910
actually, the first thing you should check

536
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,630
if you have any kind of
unexpected output is your prompt.

537
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,670
Because that's a lot of the time

538
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,990
where you can start seeing
the quickest improvements.

539
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,100
So, for this specific agent,
we're gonna tell the agent

540
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,680
that you are a gameplay expert.

541
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,540
Your job, your expertise

542
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,630
includes anything around game mechanics,

543
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,980
and we're gonna let it know

544
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,920
that it has access to a knowledge base,

545
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,620
and we have specific instructions

546
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,250
telling it how to leverage
the knowledge base,

547
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,190
and how we want it to
query the knowledge base

548
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,260
and return information

549
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,040
whether it found sufficient
information or not.

550
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,730
Now, this is a basic Strands agent.

551
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,830
Now, the next thing we have to do

552
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,510
is we define

553
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,360
our

554
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:48,570
AgentCore,

555
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,090
the next thing we wanna do
is to be able to deploy this

556
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,950
to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

557
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,730
And so for that, what we
would need to do is one,

558
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:01,470
we need to use this Bedrock
AgentCore application.

559
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,600
Basically, what this is is a wrapper

560
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,110
to give it all the tools
that it needs to be to deploy

561
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,613
to an AgentCore Runtime.

562
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,510
And the reason that we need this is,

563
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,230
think about how many of you
have used Docker before?

564
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,520
So in Docker,

565
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,950
if you wanna make something
web service enabled,

566
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,460
you need to basically make it
into some kind of web server

567
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,050
using either something
like FastAPI or like Flask.

568
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,500
This is the Bedrock AgentCore

569
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,060
like flavor of that.

570
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,360
But you can also use the other frameworks,

571
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,210
like for example, FastAPI if
you would like to as well.

572
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,970
But this is a really
easy way to get started.

573
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,700
And then with that, the
last thing that you need

574
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,790
for your main logic is
you just need to have

575
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:52,790
your app.entrypoint, and
that's gonna tell your runtime

576
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,930
like where your main function is.

577
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,890
And that is how you
create your first agent,

578
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,550
and it's ready to go to
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

579
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,340
And so, then when you want to deploy it,

580
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,750
you have a few different options,

581
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,070
you can do it through the console,

582
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,190
or you can use our CLI for AgentCore

583
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,400
where you will just configure
it, and in the background,

584
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,310
it's gonna create all the
resources that it needs

585
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,590
to deploy it to a Docker container.

586
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,790
And then as a result,
it'll give you a endpoint,

587
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,650
and you'll use that endpoint

588
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,490
to invoke it in your application.

589
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,323
(people chattering distantly)

590
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:33,260
Now, the next, this with
Strands and AgentCore,

591
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,230
one of the things I've
really appreciated about it

592
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,330
is the fact that since it's so

593
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,750
intuitive to use,

594
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,890
once you've created one
good agent, you can really,

595
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,010
it becomes even faster and
faster to create the other agents

596
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,490
because you don't really
have to change that much.

597
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,040
And I'm gonna prove that
to you by showing you

598
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,033
a different agent.

599
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,390
This one is our strategy agent.

600
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,750
And so, I mentioned before, this one,

601
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,040
for every agent, every
Strands agent, we have tools,

602
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,873
our model, our system prompt.

603
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,133
And we can see here that
not a lot has changed.

604
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,223
We still have the same
code for our Bedrock model.

605
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,763
We have the system prompt present,

606
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,020
and then we have

607
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,540
our MCP server.

608
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,010
And the only thing that's different here

609
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,600
is we have a different tag

610
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,821
because we're using a
different knowledge base,

611
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,780
and then our system prompt.

612
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,990
Instead of telling it that
it's a gameplay agent,

613
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,760
we're saying that it's a strategy agent,

614
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,310
and it has access to strategy documents

615
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,740
instead of game design documents.

616
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,530
But that's really all the difference.

617
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,500
And so, now we're gonna talk about

618
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,650
how we can use the tool Kiro

619
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,530
to

620
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,093
making more agents even faster.

621
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,853
- [Sam] Awesome!

622
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,783
So, who here has used Kiro before?

623
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,290
Just me? Okay, cool.

624
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,290
So, inside of Kiro, obviously,
it's just like an IDE,

625
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,610
like anyone else's IDE.

626
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,500
You have obviously like your editor,

627
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,230
you can change things down
here, like for example,

628
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,970
what type of language you have.

629
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,610
You can also change like
your auto completion rules,

630
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,050
your formats, your themes.

631
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,420
But the most coolest part about it

632
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,140
is you have the new chat feature over here

633
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,220
on the right hand side.

634
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,020
Now, there's two different types of chat

635
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,280
that you can have with Kiro.

636
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,930
First off is the vibe section.

637
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,720
If you wanna vibe with Kiro,
that's great, if you wanna do

638
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,330
like small code changes or
even single file changes.

639
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,730
But for me, I want to
build a brand new feature,

640
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,730
or in this case, I
wanna build a new agent.

641
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,070
Obviously, the agent is probably
a little bit of overkill

642
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,420
for spec-driven development,

643
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,730
but we're just gonna be
using it as an example.

644
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,350
A better example in the future would be

645
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,210
instead of having me
build out a single agent,

646
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,070
it'll be building out
all the separate agents

647
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,560
and just me giving some
specs around like, hey,

648
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,810
here are the MCP servers
that you should use.

649
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,640
So, inside of here,

650
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,050
I have a prompt already
pre-populated that I'm gonna run,

651
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,430
but I'll be explaining
you guys that prompt

652
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,020
while it's running.

653
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,060
So, inside of this prompt, I'm telling it

654
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,250
to only use the folder
Kiro building, so that way,

655
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,720
it doesn't get any of the wonderful code

656
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,970
that we have prepared
already for you today.

657
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,920
I will only work in
that side of that folder

658
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,983
and place all the new code
in the new lore agent basic.

659
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,190
I've asked it just create two tasks

660
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,480
just for demo purposes today,

661
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,430
and we'll see if it follows
through on that today.

662
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,640
Other than that, the prompt was hey,

663
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,970
build out a new agent
based off of the old agents

664
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,320
that we've already created,

665
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,140
and then it will create
a lore pump for us,

666
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,690
and make sure to install any
needed packages, for example,

667
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,860
if we're using Strands today,

668
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,243
it'll go ahead and do that.

669
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,253
So, while that's running,

670
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:50,160
I will review the new requirements
the (indistinct) created.

671
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,620
So, the requirements
document overview is that

672
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,320
this is really, if you
were to design a paper

673
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,850
that you give your executive,

674
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,950
this is what a requirements
doc would look like for them.

675
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,750
It would really contain things like,

676
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,490
oh, what is a lore agent supposed to be?

677
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,080
What is a Strands SDK?

678
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,150
You would hand that off
to like your manager,

679
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,940
your BD, and they'd be like,
"Aww, this is really helpful

680
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,100
because they would not
understand these terms."

681
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,680
For us engineers, we'd be
like, "All right, yeah,

682
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,030
requirements looks good enough to me,

683
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,130
and we move on to the
more important section,

684
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,150
which is the design doc."

685
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,790
The design doc contains all
the implementation details

686
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,320
and the requirement stocks

687
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,570
that we would typically
look at as engineers.

688
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,350
So inside of here, you'll
see the key components

689
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,300
that we want to have,
the different interfaces

690
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,790
and interactions that we
want to have with that,

691
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,320
so it will give a little bit more detail,

692
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,170
for example, what an app
entry point would be,

693
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,890
the lore agent functions, give
different connections for MCP

694
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,230
and give some variable names
that we might want to utilize.

695
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,980
For example, I pasted it in
here, what knowledge base

696
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,000
I want to use, and was able
to keep moving forward.

697
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,340
After that, we like gave a,
for example, the Bedrock model

698
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,170
we should use, the system prompts,

699
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,440
and it'll kinda give us a
detailed overview of exactly how

700
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,140
the implementation of something
like this would happen.

701
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,760
Obviously, with more complex projects,

702
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,640
this doc gets really cool
and a lot of detail in there.

703
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,250
And to be honest, it is a
great first step to documenting

704
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,820
what you've built in the new
feature that you've built.

705
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,200
After this is all done

706
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,930
and it takes all this
entire design doc in,

707
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,670
it will then create a task list.

708
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,230
Inside of this task list,

709
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,240
it'll contain all the different tasks

710
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,040
that we have to do to build this thing.

711
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,020
So, you notice that we
only have two tasks,

712
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,910
but typically on a lot of other features,

713
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,880
we are gonna have longer tasks
or even more tasks in this,

714
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,740
and even some subtasks.

715
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,350
So, we'll go ahead and get
started on the first task itself,

716
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,330
and it will go ahead and run that task.

717
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,910
At any point if it has any questions,

718
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,740
or if it needs to run any
commands, it'll ask me

719
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,763
before doing so.

720
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:44,850
Well obviously, we just released today,

721
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,150
Hero Anonymous or
Autonomous, which allows us

722
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,440
to run things in the background
or even sign GitHub actions

723
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,390
or GitHub pull requests, I should say.

724
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,950
And

725
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,160
GitHub feature requests inside of Kiro.

726
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,110
So, it will do the entire
thing behind the scenes

727
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,000
instead of something like in the CLI.

728
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,500
I personally like to use it in the CLI

729
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,120
when I'm actively building something,

730
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,280
'cause I get that feedback
right then and there,

731
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,040
and I can change things as I see fit.

732
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,290
So, the first task is now complete,

733
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,150
and while that second
task gets kicked off,

734
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,440
one of the really cool
things that it does,

735
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,710
it gives you a nice little
overview of what it has done.

736
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,700
So, inside of here, it tells
me it created a folder,

737
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,210
configured the Bedrock model,
gave me an initial prompt,

738
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,370
gave me the MCP client
that's supposed to connect,

739
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,440
gave me environment
variables and error handling,

740
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
and entry points as well.

741
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,460
Afterwards, the next task, obviously,

742
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,470
I've made this very simple for Kiro,

743
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,210
is gonna be building
out a requirements TIC.

744
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,950
So, it's gonna go through
that file it created

745
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,900
and validate that all the requirements

746
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,140
that we need for Python are
gonna be properly installed

747
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,413
and configured for us to
utilize for this project.

748
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,850
So after that, we are able
to have a brand new agent

749
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,530
spun up with Kiro.

750
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,990
Saves us a lot of time and
makes our lives a lot easier.

751
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,460
Obviously, that was a very simple task

752
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,990
and there's a lot more cool complex tasks

753
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,090
that you can kind of do,
but just wanted to use that

754
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,990
as an example of how you can use Kiro.

755
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,340
Now that we've kind of talked
about how we build the agents,

756
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,260
let's dive into our next section.

757
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,290
Let's take a look at what
it looks like to combine

758
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,123
all these things.

759
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,244
So obviously, we can go in
here, and go ahead and create

760
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:17,610
a brand new project.

761
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,510
Inside this project,

762
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,940
we're gonna fill out this
just like we did last time.

763
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,760
We're gonna use our same
doc for the Elven Expansion.

764
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,950
We're gonna go in here and
paste that document in.

765
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,690
And this time, we're gonna configure it

766
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,250
with the analyst thing.

767
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,380
Notice how we're not able
to select any other agents

768
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,900
because all the other agents
are gonna be available

769
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,830
in the analyst.

770
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,200
The analyst is just
gonna use them as tools.

771
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,870
So, we're gonna go ahead
and create that project.

772
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,180
Once again, using some
wonderful demo magic,

773
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,740
I already have done this ahead of time.

774
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,960
So, what we have here is this

775
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,120
wonderful review of this document.

776
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,850
And inside of here, it gives
us a high level overview.

777
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,670
This gives us the three
different agents that it called,

778
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,010
and gave us a reason why or
why we should not proceed

779
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,910
with this project.

780
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,430
For example, the lore,
as I mentioned before,

781
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,540
does not fit at all.

782
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,120
Elves do not fit into
the context of this game.

783
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,950
So, we're able to kind of look at that,

784
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,950
evaluate that, and immediately see that.

785
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,270
After that, we can literally dive

786
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,530
into each of the consistencies

787
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,990
just like the original three prompts are.

788
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,290
But this time, it's all
available one-sided doc.

789
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,510
And so, you can kind of see
that each one of these areas,

790
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,940
it kind of gives us a
nice little overview,

791
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,100
and we're able to
identify different themes

792
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,693
and dive into it as well.

793
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,440
One thing you'll notice as
well is that it will give us

794
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,240
the entire tokens that are outputted,

795
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,650
as well as the response time,

796
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,413
as well as the average cost
for that document review.

797
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,130
After that, we can then
ask additional prompts

798
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,963
to back to this.

799
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:42,390
For example, can we dive
into how agents can be used

800
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,250
instead of elves, which is a valid race

801
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,350
inside of "New World."

802
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,210
What this does is then it takes a look at

803
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,500
all the different gameplay agents

804
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,640
and stuff like that afterwards,

805
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,500
and is able to dive into, oh!

806
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,090
This change that I've made

807
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,520
is able to then align and move forward.

808
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,710
If I continue having a
conversation with this bot,

809
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,960
it'll continue to be able to create

810
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,400
and design things for me.

811
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,600
So, next thing I asked is, hey,

812
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,370
can you create a quest around this?

813
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,830
And what it did is instead
of calling all the agents,

814
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,930
it started utilizing just certain agents.

815
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,930
So, now that we have strategy
pretty much satisfied,

816
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,290
this one, it just went ahead
and called gameplay and lore!

817
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,680
And it built an entire quest
around the gameplay and lore.

818
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,260
And it was able to design
a entire quest for me.

819
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,450
And what I can use this
for is I can keep iterating

820
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,240
and build a whole a design doc around this

821
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,830
and ask more questions.

822
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,090
And as you are all familiar,

823
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,770
if you've ever written
requirements docs before,

824
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,120
this is a collaborative process

825
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,980
that usually when you give
your first design doc,

826
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,450
unless you've written it so many times

827
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,240
or you've been like preparing
it for months ahead,

828
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,520
you always get feedback on your docs.

829
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,730
And this is just that iteration
and the ability to ask

830
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,810
for more details,

831
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,960
and to continue that
iteration process offline

832
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,180
or more streamlined.

833
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,010
So, after multiple different
things, you'll see that

834
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,310
we have different token
utilizations, response times,

835
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,840
as well as estimated costs

836
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,740
that are all outputted
from the Strands SDK,

837
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,940
that you can easily use
through the metrics.

838
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,790
With this, we obviously
are just trying to combine

839
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,623
all the agents.

840
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:12,900
So, there's some areas
that we can improve upon,

841
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,040
with like for example memory.

842
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,510
But we'll dive into
that a little bit later.

843
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,263
Let's first talk about how
we build this with Strands.

844
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,263
- [Christina] Alright.

845
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,216
Okay, so I like to.

846
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,490
So, I like to, I'm gonna
bring up a picture,

847
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,670
'cause I think this is the
best way to demonstrate

848
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,860
how our orchestrator is built.

849
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,703
So,

850
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,910
this one is gonna be
a little bit different

851
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:46,770
because this agent is not
gonna be directly retrieving

852
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,480
information from the knowledge bases,

853
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,000
but instead, it's going to delegate

854
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,060
to our our specialized agents.

855
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,620
So, the way that we have
this one designed is instead,

856
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,590
we're going to be having our main agent,

857
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,210
our Game Analyst Agent.

858
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,450
This is gonna be defined same as before,

859
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,080
except this time, its
tools are going to be

860
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,553
the specialized agents.

861
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,463
And with that, the way we'll
be doing this is we'll be,

862
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,780
our orchestrator, what's gonna happen

863
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,780
is when it gets our query,
like a game design proposal,

864
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,840
its job is gonna be to break
down the design proposal

865
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,380
and to figure out which
questions need to be answered

866
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,003
to evaluate it across gameplay,
lore, strategy, and QA.

867
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
It'll delegate to those
specialized agents to go and grab

868
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,830
that information for it.

869
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,940
And then, those agents will
return it to the orchestrator,

870
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,110
and the orchestrator will
synthesize it and create

871
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,000
a more

872
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,700
concise response based
off of all of its findings

873
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,960
with full visibility

874
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,913
across all of the core competencies.

875
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,193
So, now let's take a look at
how that is built in the code.

876
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,613
So, go to the game analyst.

877
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,220
So, we can see here, it
is very, very similar

878
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,543
to what we had before.

879
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,890
We have our model that is still defined,

880
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,833
still using Anthropic Claude's on it.

881
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,700
We are going to have our system prompt

882
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,350
and I'll just make this
a little bit bigger,

883
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,550
but this time in our system prompt,

884
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,780
we're going to be saying
you are a game analyst,

885
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,300
and your job is to take in

886
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,520
game design documents or questions,

887
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,060
and you need to analyze all game designs

888
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,373
for the core competencies.

889
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,810
With that, we're gonna tell
it that it has access to

890
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,720
the following tools
that we want it to use.

891
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,410
So, for anything around
lore, we're gonna send it

892
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,760
to the lore agent.

893
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,040
For anything around gameplay,

894
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,550
we're gonna have it send
questions to the gameplay agent.

895
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,090
And same for the strategy agent as well.

896
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,630
And then with that, we
have, we're now leveraging

897
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,810
the other type of tool
that I alluded to earlier,

898
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,130
our custom tools.

899
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:25,130
And that is all done by
adding this tool decorator.

900
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,070
And so, for each specialized agent,

901
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,450
we're just gonna have a function

902
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,200
that invokes them using the Boto3 Library.

903
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,840
And that is how we would use those agents,

904
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,050
and then with that, we
still have the same stuff,

905
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,890
we got our main function right
here with our entry point.

906
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,890
And that initialization
that was up at the top

907
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,403
for our wrapper to make it
ready for an AgentCore Runtime.

908
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,143
Right, now we can go to the.

909
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,300
(participant chattering distantly)

910
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,370
No, that's the next (indistinct) part.

911
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,540
- [Sam] So, now that we have

912
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,180
all our game analysts
ready to rock and roll,

913
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,340
now we wanna look at adding Memories.

914
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,650
And why do you think
memories are important?

915
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,110
Well first of all, they give us access to

916
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,990
the ability to communicate with the thing

917
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,450
and remember our prompts, and
everything else like that.

918
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,440
So right now, inside of my agent
that I have built up today,

919
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,970
I've actually decided to send

920
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,520
the entire conversation
history every single time

921
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,353
with the agent.

922
00:38:24,353 --> 00:38:25,703
That includes that original document

923
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,320
and all these original,
the document feedbacks

924
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,520
that I've gotten as well.

925
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,770
So, as I continue to iterate

926
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,840
and continue to build on this doc,

927
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,260
that number of tokens, input
tokens are gonna skyrocket.

928
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,540
Every single time I send another update,

929
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,750
it gives me another prompt
back or a big document back.

930
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,090
That means that I'm storing
more and more detail

931
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,130
back to each individual project, right?

932
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,810
So that's not helpful.

933
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,780
On top of that, each of the
different agents underlying

934
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,580
are going back to the knowledge bases

935
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,140
and querying for more data.

936
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,310
For example, if I asked to
add agents instead of elves,

937
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,170
and it had to go look up the ancients,

938
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,430
it's gonna have to do that again

939
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,200
when I asked to design that quest,

940
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,300
it's gonna have to go back to the more

941
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,590
and go pull all that detail.

942
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,990
Because of the fact that
it pulled it at one time

943
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,310
and didn't store it anywhere.

944
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,590
So, since I'm only
sending the chat details,

945
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,360
I did not remember that at all.

946
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,580
That's where things like Memories
can come in handy, right?

947
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,640
It can remember, oh I
already pulled that details

948
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,473
from the knowledge base,

949
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:22,950
I already remember what ancients are.

950
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,720
It might need to go
look up certain details

951
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,553
around the ancients,

952
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,901
maybe it didn't store
like the details around

953
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:29,250
what region they live in,

954
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,780
but it's stored like what they are.

955
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,840
So instead of doing a deep
lookup into ancients in general,

956
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,250
it might have to do lookups

957
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,120
into only specific areas of that race.

958
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,380
So, what we'll look at here is that

959
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,240
we'll do the same exact thing
with the project spin up.

960
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,980
This time, we'll create a new project,

961
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,320
and as time, we'll see
that we can select analyst,

962
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,210
and we'll actually turn on Memory Enabled.

963
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,620
Once again, I won't go ahead and run this

964
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,840
'cause I've already
run this ahead of time,

965
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,830
and you can see that

966
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,480
we already had a response
back with the Memories.

967
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,360
We're then gonna be able to read through

968
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,550
the entire response, dive into it,

969
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,140
and then you can see that number of tokens

970
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,120
between the two are very similar.

971
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,220
That's because of the fact that
this is the first analysis,

972
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,160
it's reading the entire document
for the first time, right?

973
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,460
It's supposed to use
everything it has available.

974
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,850
But as we continue to
call it as I did today,

975
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,313
oh, did not like that for some reason.

976
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,390
Lemme go back to this real quick.

977
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,250
So, as it said, as I continue to ask

978
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,100
the same exact prompts
for the sake of this demo,

979
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,170
I asked it the same exact
prompts of designing

980
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,580
a quest around it.

981
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,290
I asked it to use the ancients.

982
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,480
I've proceeded to go
through the entire process,

983
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,745
you'll notice at the very bottom here

984
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:43,770
that our token usage is actually dropped.

985
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,540
And that's because the fact
that we're using Memories.

986
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,460
We're no longer having to
query our knowledge base

987
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,570
every single time.

988
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,340
We're no longer having
to read the document

989
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,480
every single time.

990
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,340
We're just being able to utilize

991
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,070
what we've already called
in a different manner

992
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,850
and be able to provide more
and more things back and forth.

993
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,980
The other thing that's also
interesting to look at is that

994
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,990
the response time starts to drop as well.

995
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,970
Because I start understanding
the knowledge base,

996
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,850
I start understanding the
knowledge of what is happening.

997
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,650
Obviously, you can also
improve that response times

998
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,750
by using things like specialized agents.

999
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,180
Definitely like the Nova training models

1000
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,770
that just came out today.

1001
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,820
Those are all different areas

1002
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,710
that you also can improve
that response times,

1003
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,020
but Memories just dropped
our response times

1004
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,630
by over 80 seconds, which is crazy.

1005
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,240
So, by using Memories,
we're able to provide

1006
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,060
a better response time, as
well as using less tokens,

1007
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,160
which obviously drives
your cost down as well.

1008
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,280
So, I'll hand it off to Christina
to talk a little bit more

1009
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,140
about how you can actually enable Memories

1010
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,570
and utilize that, awesome.

1011
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,040
- [Christina] Okay, so lemme
go back to my pictures.

1012
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,203
I got another lovely picture for you guys.

1013
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,033
So,

1014
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,110
the way that we are implementing Memories

1015
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,790
is at a few different levels.

1016
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,590
I talked about this a little bit before,

1017
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,350
but we have our project-specific Memories

1018
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,150
that are gonna be storing facts.

1019
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,733
And then, we have our Session Memories,

1020
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,180
our Session Memories and
our User Preference Memories

1021
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,760
to help out our Game Analyst Agent.

1022
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,070
So for that,

1023
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,160
our orchestrator is very similar to

1024
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,083
the way before, except for,

1025
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,650
we have a little,

1026
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,720
we have our memory integration.

1027
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,630
So, what that requires is
we're actually gonna add

1028
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,010
a couple extra tools.

1029
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,160
So, we'll start with
the specialized agents.

1030
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,080
At the specialized agents level,

1031
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,810
what we'll be doing is you would add,

1032
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,240
in order to integrate Memories,

1033
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,400
is you're gonna use tools to,

1034
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,030
you're gonna define tools that
are gonna be able to restore

1035
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,650
and retrieve memories.

1036
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,110
And then, you're gonna have memory hooks.

1037
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,893
This is gonna be specific to Strands,

1038
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,620
if you think about it
like this, in an agent,

1039
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,260
an agent has a life cycle.

1040
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,990
And in this life cycle,
you have different phases

1041
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,300
from when the agent is initialized

1042
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,153
to when the conversation is
over, and the agent is done.

1043
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,730
With Strands hooks, you can customize

1044
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,930
the logic of how your agents interact

1045
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,590
and how they function at
each point in their lifetime.

1046
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,740
And so with hooks, we're
gonna define how it stores

1047
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,400
and retrieves Memories

1048
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:33,300
with the interaction

1049
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,233
between the agent and Amazon
Bedrock AgentCore Memories.

1050
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,340
And so, at the specialized agent level,

1051
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,830
we're going to be leveraging,

1052
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,740
we're gonna be using
Memories like a cache.

1053
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,020
So, the whole idea is we want to reduce

1054
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,170
how often the specialized agent
has to go all the way back

1055
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,840
to the knowledge base and
look for the information,

1056
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,720
and we'll have it do
instead its first check

1057
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,680
and see if it's already answered
a similar question before

1058
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,330
or retrieved like the information

1059
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,580
that it's looking for before.

1060
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,520
And only if it can't
find that information,

1061
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,540
in its Memories,

1062
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,713
then it'll go back to the
data source and go as normal.

1063
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,370
Additionally, we have our game analyst,

1064
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,770
is gonna be leveraging Session Memories,

1065
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,230
so at the beginning of its
lifecycle, we're gonna have it

1066
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:27,090
load X number of previous
conversations into its context

1067
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,320
to provide more information
on previous conversations.

1068
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,040
And then, we also have it
leveraging user preferences

1069
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,640
to provide that more
personalized experience.

1070
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,010
So, now let's dive back into the code

1071
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,460
and see what that looks like.

1072
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,783
So, I know I've been saying this a lot,

1073
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:49,800
(chuckling) but a lot of this is gonna be

1074
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,960
very similar to what we had before.

1075
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,320
And the reason I keep
mentioning this is because,

1076
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,240
what I really want you
guys to get out of this

1077
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,560
is just how easy it is to work
with the Strands framework.

1078
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,180
With this, we still have the
model defined just as before,

1079
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,510
and we have our system prompt.

1080
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,060
This is actually, spoiler alert,

1081
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,270
this is gonna be the most different piece.

1082
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,900
You can see we've got some
extra like notations in here

1083
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,893
and all of that.

1084
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,490
And actually, this was
an experiment that I had

1085
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,250
when I was building out this agent to see

1086
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,430
how much we can improve
the agent's performance

1087
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:34,110
with just a prompt, who all
enjoys prompt engineering

1088
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,220
and feels like confident

1089
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,680
in their abilities with it. (chuckling)

1090
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,040
See? Not very many of us,
I'm in the same boat as you.

1091
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,820
But with tools like Amazon Bedrock,

1092
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,760
you don't have to be an
expert in prompt engineering,

1093
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,260
and I'm gonna show you why.

1094
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,510
So, I'm gonna go over into the console

1095
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,330
and show you a new tool that I love,

1096
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,870
which is our Prompt
Manager, Prompt Builder.

1097
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,870
So with that, I actually
took the original prompt

1098
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,370
from our original agent,

1099
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,940
and I pasted it into here.

1100
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,660
And you can tell it
what model you're using,

1101
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,170
and it will optimize the
prompt for you for that model.

1102
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,450
And so, I actually just
took this and copied

1103
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,530
and pasted it into the code, and I got

1104
00:46:23,996 --> 00:46:26,970
immediate results from
it, it was really cool.

1105
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:27,993
So,

1106
00:46:30,107 --> 00:46:32,310
one of the main differences.

1107
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,590
And then the other piece that's different,

1108
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,220
is we now just tell, so now
we have Memories, right?

1109
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,950
So, all we have to do now
is tell the system prompt

1110
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,590
that it has access to memory tools.

1111
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,730
It's very straightforward.

1112
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,760
And so, we tell it, "Hey,
go check the Memories first,

1113
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,060
and for like the
information that you need,

1114
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,640
and then if you don't
have the information,

1115
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,340
then go about your job as normal."

1116
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,450
And so, we have that here,

1117
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,390
and we can see we still
have our same tools.

1118
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,720
And then finally, the last thing we have

1119
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,080
is we just are going to initialize,

1120
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,270
we're gonna just basically say now

1121
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,240
instead of just leveraging

1122
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,740
the custom tools

1123
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,680
that we had before, where
we said we have that logic

1124
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,160
to go and invoke the other
agents, we also are telling it

1125
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,843
to use the memory tools as
part of its like tool belt.

1126
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,990
And that's all you really need to do.

1127
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,700
And then you go about as normal,

1128
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,040
you have your AgentCore
Runtime initialized,

1129
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,920
I believe that is up here.

1130
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,840
And you have your entry point.

1131
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,600
And that's like the entire magic

1132
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,700
behind the whole thing. (laughing)

1133
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,663
So,

1134
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,720
with that, we'll go back

1135
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,733
to the presentation.
(Christina shuffling)

1136
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,413
So,

1137
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,550
well first, I want to talk about,

1138
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,970
I think I accidentally
pressed a button earlier.

1139
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,570
So, just a recap of what we did today.

1140
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,710
So, what we did was we
learned how to build

1141
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:12,240
Specialized Agents and
Orchestrator Agents in Strands.

1142
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,950
And we saw through our demo of how

1143
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,530
by leveraging AI agents,

1144
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,320
we can accelerate game designers

1145
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,430
in their innovation cycles by
providing them with a place

1146
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,010
to get quick and early feedback,

1147
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,440
so that they can basically have

1148
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,860
a more fine-tuned design proposal

1149
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,500
for that human interaction
with the game analyst,

1150
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,840
so we can reduce all the back and forth.

1151
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,790
Additionally, we saw specialized
agents working together,

1152
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,895
and alongside the designers and analysts

1153
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:48,600
to provide that

1154
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
collaborative intelligence of
the AI information retrieval,

1155
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,030
plus a humans industry experience.

1156
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,560
And then finally,

1157
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,560
because all of our agents
are gonna have access to

1158
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,020
a standardized knowledge
base, we're able to create

1159
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,740
a more unbiased, standardized
baseline assessment

1160
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:15,740
to kind of have a predictable
kind of starting point

1161
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,423
for all of the design proposals.

1162
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,610
And then, if there are three key takeaways

1163
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,250
that we would want you
to walk away with today,

1164
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,640
these are the three I would
say are the most important one.

1165
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,850
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore simplifies

1166
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,330
the development of production ready agents

1167
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:40,170
by providing you with runtimes
that are scalable and secure,

1168
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,090
and all the tools that you need

1169
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,540
to continue to help your agents evolve

1170
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,470
in a secure and performant manner.

1171
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,800
Additionally, you can enhance
your agent performance

1172
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,800
and user experiences with
AgentCore memory by reducing,

1173
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,230
by increasing the performance
through lower latency,

1174
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,490
by using it as a cache,

1175
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,730
and providing more
personalized experiences.

1176
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,420
And additionally, and
the last one is you can

1177
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,750
accelerate your design
teams by equipping them

1178
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,330
with the tools to transform
subjective feedback

1179
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,190
into objective insights.

1180
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,550
And this will enable

1181
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,563
faster and more confident
game design decisions.

1182
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,783
So, some next steps, we've
left some links for here.

1183
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,850
Be sure to look out for
our GitHub repository.

1184
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:37,560
We do have it posted, and
we're continuing to add to it.

1185
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,290
We have, if you are interested in having

1186
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,980
any more hands-on tutorials
with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

1187
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,560
this is a really great place
to start with the samples.

1188
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,970
I personally actually use them

1189
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,770
to learn how to use AgentCore.

1190
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,810
And then finally, if you want

1191
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:56,190
a really cool hands-on
workshop with another use case

1192
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,560
for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore,

1193
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,680
check out the Autonomous
Live-Ops AI agents

1194
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,250
for Dynamic Gaming Experiences session.

1195
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,980
I actually sat in on the dry runs for it

1196
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,510
and it was really cool.

1197
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,990
So, please do check it
out if you have time.

1198
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,620
And I wanna open it up for questions,

1199
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,879
and thank you all so much for being here.

1200
00:51:18,879 --> 00:51:19,712
(audience clapping)

1201
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:20,878
- [Audience Member] Woo!
