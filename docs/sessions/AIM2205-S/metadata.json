  "abstract": "AI coding agents promise faster development, but in reality, many teams face chaos instead of clarity. Different tools, inconsistent code quality, rising costs, and lack of visibility make it hard for organizations to scale AI responsibly. The result? Developers experiment, managers worry, and trust in AI adoption breaks down. Let's talk about whether it's possible to build that trust. Can freedom of choice for developers and transparent governance for organizations coexist? This presentation is brought to you by JetBrains, an AWS Partner.",
  "abstract_cn": "AI编码代理承诺加快开发速度，但实际上，许多团队面临的是混乱而非清晰。不同的工具、不一致的代码质量、成本上升以及缺乏可见性，使得组织难以负责任地扩展AI。结果如何？开发人员进行实验，管理人员担忧，对AI采用的信任破裂。让我们讨论是否可能建立这种信任。开发人员的选择自由和组织的透明治理能否共存？本演示由AWS合作伙伴JetBrains为您呈现。",
