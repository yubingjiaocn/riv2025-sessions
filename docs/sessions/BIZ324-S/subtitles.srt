1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,759
So if there's anything that any of

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,788
us, I think,

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,300
realize as we build and scale

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,519
an AI led future for any of our

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,539
businesses,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,658
it's the knowledge and reality that

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,699
platforms and foundations really matter.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,620
And we've spent a lot of time in that

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,789
West thinking about the set

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,408
of shared capabilities

11
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:35,189
that are AI powered,

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,069
modern cloud native capabilities

13
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,109
that will underpin our AI powered

14
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,149
future. And this is what we call

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,270
our digital spine.

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,618
Our ambition as a bank is enormous

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,658
to be

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,158
the most customer centric digital

19
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,118
bank that is delighting

20
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,118
our customers every single day by reinventing

21
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:57,509
banking experiences

22
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,098
wherever they are

23
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:02,009
and at every point of need.

24
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,650
And we're doing that across 33 big

25
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,308
strategic pillars. The first is delivering growth,

26
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:09,109
of course.

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,120
So we're very fortunate that each of our businesses,

28
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:15,290
from our core retail bank to our commercial

29
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,549
institutional bank, which you'll hear from Jen a

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,569
bit later,

31
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,528
to our wealth bank, our mortgage business.

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,730
All of those businesses are growing, and they're growing

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,808
because we're because we're investing in our customers.

34
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,629
We're investing in that hyper personalization

35
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,209
that can only be delivered through AI.

36
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,418
Secondly, we're simplifying our bank, but we're

37
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:38,480
not simplifying it for its own sake.

38
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,180
And I think many a transformation has been

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,569
and gone and failed

40
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:46,198
simply because simplification and rationalization

41
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:47,278
exists

42
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:49,000
to reduce the numbers.

43
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,088
For us, simplification is about outcomes. It's

44
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:54,168
about value delivered to our customers,

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,269
and it's in service of those great

46
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,650
AI powered journeys that we're delivering.

47
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,638
And then finally, of course, we're a bank, so

48
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:04,799
we have to focus on better managing our

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,698
capital assets and we do that

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,800
through a really significantly

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,838
scaled data transformation

52
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:13,000
journey that we're on.

53
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,849
And all of those things are building our digital

54
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:16,419
spine.

55
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:18,740
And let me

56
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,710
pick out some highlights of of that spine.

57
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,008
Firstly, integration.

58
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:26,399
You'll know that within the financial services

59
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,439
sector, we're an ecosystem where

60
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,258
we need interoperability. We're connecting

61
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:33,360
with payments with

62
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:35,758
third parties, with counterparties.

63
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:38,258
So integration really matters and

64
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,939
um our AI power bank

65
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,919
is, is, is built

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,778
on secure connectivity for what

67
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:48,439
are really truly AI orchestrated services.

68
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,538
Secondly, our data marketplace, and some of you may

69
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,088
have heard of that in other sessions

70
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:56,250
this last few days, but where data fuels

71
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,330
the insights and models of our

72
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,508
AI ecosystem,

73
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:02,330
and really building and scaling a data

74
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,979
fabric anchored around a mesh architecture

75
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,008
that that enables that AI

76
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:07,750
powered bank.

77
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,770
Simplification really to us is about

78
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,808
building an AI driven intelligent core

79
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:15,588
banking platform.

80
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,210
That delivers adaptive and personalized

81
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,569
products, all enabled by AI.

82
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:25,740
And then finally,

83
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,058
resource management, of course, is about a

84
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:30,118
scaled AI ecosystem that

85
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:32,699
enables every single employee in the bank

86
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,740
to achieve more.

87
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,819
And we're really proud of our digital spine.

88
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,969
We're really proud of the way that we're

89
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,169
infusing AI into every single

90
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,319
component of that architecture that

91
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:46,969
is really building the foundations of

92
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,990
an AI powered digital future.

93
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,719
So how are we doing this then? So we're, we

94
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,808
have delivered and developed an AI reference

95
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:56,618
architecture.

96
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,520
Uh, and we see that architecture across

97
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,479
four tiers.

98
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,849
It would be remiss of me not to

99
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,379
to call out the reality that this isn't a

100
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,599
technology problem, of course.

101
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:10,899
We're incredibly fortunate

102
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,099
to be in our industry right now at

103
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,159
a time of enormous disruption where

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,720
technology is no longer the inhibitor.

105
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,178
And the the joy and excitement of being

106
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,220
here at Reinvent, I think has really brought that into

107
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,678
focus, hasn't it, that

108
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,488
what's limiting us as businesses, as

109
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:27,858
individuals, is our imagination.

110
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,358
We're no longer constrained by the technology.

111
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:33,980
But to achieve those outcomes,

112
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,369
we need an operating model that scales and an

113
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,449
operating model that is fit for an AI powered

114
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,199
future. Where

115
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,389
controls

116
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,850
are there, and where we've established an AI

117
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,790
ready culture.

118
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,970
And that's also where partners come in.

119
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,790
I think as in scale transformation

120
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,579
of this,

121
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,250
of this extent, partners really matter.

122
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,509
And you know, we're delighted to be partnering

123
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,709
with Emphasis, um,

124
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:00,309
a really important partner for this journey with us

125
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,528
who show up every single day with

126
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:03,750
awesome people,

127
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:06,009
fantastic ideas, and, and

128
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,350
in no baggage, no strings attached,

129
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,889
just aligned to our outcomes.

130
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,129
So partnerships really matter, and selecting those

131
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:16,189
purposefully is is part of the journey.

132
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,389
Our core tech and data fabric, I've talked a lot about

133
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,730
that, but, you know, really focusing on integration,

134
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,608
on security and scale

135
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,588
in a agentic world where

136
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,850
access to trusted, secure, reliable data

137
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,439
is, is the

138
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,488
cornerstone of success. And then

139
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,379
where the magic really happens is the third layer,

140
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:37,600
which is our

141
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:39,649
AI powered decision making.

142
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,689
Where we're building the products, where we're

143
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,309
scaling agentic solutions and

144
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,230
enabling

145
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:49,170
um the magic to happen for our customers

146
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,209
and uh and then finally digital

147
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,500
engagement, which is all about.

148
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,790
And AI ready ready interfaces

149
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,858
and really focusing on that integration and

150
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,899
intelligent products and services. And,

151
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,639
and that for me is the exciting bit where we can

152
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,619
build and deliver AI

153
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,358
infused products for our customers that really

154
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:09,798
make a difference to them every day.

155
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,259
Uh, and then I'll, I'll,

156
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:14,559
I'll finish by

157
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,319
talking a little bit about how we see

158
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,720
the use case portfolio across

159
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
our banking ecosystem and, and

160
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,420
how we're really thinking about scaled

161
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,678
AI across,

162
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,410
um, across our entire ecosystem for our

163
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,160
customers and,

164
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,699
and that's across 4 areas and

165
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,278
we see

166
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,778
a set of use cases as a, as

167
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,358
a value chain really,

168
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,278
um, starting at the very bottom with,

169
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,899
you know, scaled AI.

170
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,149
End user, low code,

171
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,778
use cases that are for everybody, personal

172
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,019
productivity, and that for us is the foundation

173
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,379
of everything that we're doing,

174
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,858
really building and scaling the capability

175
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:54,858
of every single employee to achieve more for

176
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:55,738
our customers.

177
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,889
Secondly, commodity driven use cases.

178
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:01,019
So those small little AI use cases

179
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,850
built by our amazing engineers

180
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,869
using AI generated

181
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,100
software engineering practices,

182
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,660
but those, those point use cases,

183
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:13,009
that too is the bedrock of our AI journey.

184
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,238
And then moving up the values value chain

185
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:17,108
is

186
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,970
complex firsts.

187
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,889
So those were those set of agentic services

188
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,329
that require orchestration, automation,

189
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:26,389
autonomy

190
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,329
require intervention.

191
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,000
Um, that we're really investing in

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,028
heavily with our engineering teams. And,

193
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,559
and then finally,

194
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,230
leading edge research.

195
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,769
So we see that in order to

196
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,928
really win with customers, then the

197
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,048
way to do that is to invest heavily in

198
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,119
the, in the capabilities that

199
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,759
don't yet exist. And

200
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,209
we're very fortunate to have a really powerful

201
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,709
and strong AI research team

202
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,459
who are looking into things such as deep fake

203
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,278
protection,

204
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:57,129
um, avatars, biometrics,

205
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,769
etc.

206
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:01,509
I'll just finish though by saying,

207
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:02,488
um,

208
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,149
It goes without saying, I suppose, that in

209
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,829
a world where every institution, every

210
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,439
organization, yours and mine,

211
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:12,160
will have access to powerful AI

212
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,019
where AI is no longer

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,059
where technology is no longer the inhibitor,

214
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,910
competitive advantage doesn't come just

215
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,858
from the technology.

216
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,548
It comes from partnerships. It comes from

217
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:25,588
culture. It comes from enablement

218
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,588
of people. It comes from

219
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,048
hiring the best talent.

220
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,649
And our journey towards a world class

221
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,729
AI driven future

222
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,029
for our customers. It starts

223
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:38,808
with our people.

224
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,590
And with that, I'll hand over straight to the next

225
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:55,408
speaker. I

226
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:58,408
get the click. Thank

227
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,729
you, Diana, and thank you, Manish for that

228
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:01,450
introduction.

229
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,058
Um.

230
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,690
Hello everyone, I hope I'm audible.

231
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,058
My name is Maithili Madira.

232
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm an SVP of technology. I work

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,859
for a

234
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,298
broker dealer called LPL Financial.

235
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,918
I'm New York based,

236
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,558
and I'm really glad that we got

237
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,029
this chance to sort of connect on this

238
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:23,038
core topic

239
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,479
after those exciting sessions and

240
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,639
the key notes that we've had in the last

241
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,379
two days.

242
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,399
Um,

243
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,879
this is AWS Reinvent, and I'm really

244
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,038
honored that we could be part of the forum. And

245
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,178
thank you to our Infosys partners for

246
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,558
inviting me to speak here today. This

247
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,558
is where our innovation meets execution.

248
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,080
So, and I'm excited what our teams can

249
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,090
do. The first thing

250
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,619
I want to touch upon here is when Infosy

251
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,950
asked me on this topic,

252
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,729
you know, throughout my career, I've worked

253
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:54,798
in financial services for at least the

254
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,849
last two decades, and we've done all sorts

255
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:57,849
of transformation.

256
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,239
And probably all of you can relate to

257
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,769
that work for, you know, work activities,

258
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,969
right? We've taken our monolith

259
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,509
systems, we've migrated,

260
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,739
you know, to microservices,

261
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:11,090
we've basically, you know, moved workloads to

262
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,908
the cloud,

263
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,349
all of that

264
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,649
and brought some efficiencies to our

265
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,190
businesses,

266
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,849
but all of that was taken with a digital first

267
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:19,369
hat.

268
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:22,308
Now we get to do all of this value chain

269
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,168
keeping AI as the core engine.

270
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,739
And guess what? If you don't incorporate

271
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,940
AI, people will call that an upgrade.

272
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,229
It's no longer a transformation. So that's

273
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,500
really the key, you know, point here.

274
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:35,710
We are at a place of paradigm

275
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,950
shift, and we're super excited

276
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,109
that we bring that to a certain industry,

277
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,548
despite we have a lot of regulations

278
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:44,590
and put that with the right guard leaders and

279
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,369
governance.

280
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,969
So, with that context,

281
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,950
let me take you to the firm.

282
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,149
So I work for a firm LPL Financial.

283
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,710
We're the largest

284
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,428
broker dealer in the US,

285
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,830
you know, we're a Fortune 500 firm,

286
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,908
and one of the top RIA custodians.

287
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,408
And we have definitely a very

288
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,928
large user base, which is financial advisors.

289
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,048
We serve about 32,000 of them in

290
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:10,048
the US market.

291
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:11,940
Um, you know, our firm,

292
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:14,658
uh, AUM is around 2.3 trillion,

293
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,580
and we support 8 million US households

294
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,359
today. So that's, that's the

295
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,330
space that we are in.

296
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,658
Our leadership mission and vision is

297
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:25,899
to be the best wealth management firm.

298
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,408
So this is coming top down, right? That

299
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:29,899
is the leadership aspiration.

300
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,308
And in order to get there,

301
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,840
the key thing I want to point out is, unlike,

302
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,489
you know, you know, I worked in other financial

303
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,908
institutions and banks where your customer

304
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,250
becomes your primary persona

305
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,149
that you support.

306
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,869
LPL is slightly different,

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,389
you know, and, and why I say that is

308
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,639
LPL is an advisor centric firm.

309
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,808
We focus on the financial advisor. That's

310
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,408
where our value proposition is.

311
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,808
We want advisers to be equipped with the

312
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,928
best in class tools so they

313
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,019
can support the. Financial goals

314
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,359
of our end customers, that's where

315
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,739
you know we fit in in in the broader

316
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,038
context we support various

317
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:10,979
institutions and we offer capabilities

318
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,859
to strengthen that element,

319
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:15,500
particularly why that is key is we're

320
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,479
talking about AI and digitizing

321
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,239
capabilities, but the thing to

322
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,479
recognize here is

323
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
this is a particular industry where

324
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
the human element becomes even more

325
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
important where we where we are looking

326
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,918
at digitization.

327
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,668
And why I'm stressing that particular point

328
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,250
is,

329
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:33,889
with an LPL,

330
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,590
think about it, when do you need financial advice

331
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,210
the most?

332
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,950
You need that in moments where you're making

333
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,340
life changing decisions,

334
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,908
you need to unders you want the assurance

335
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,229
and you want the confidence to take that next

336
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,269
leap. You want to be able to use

337
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,710
these advice and get that

338
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,950
confidence from a trusted advisor, and that's

339
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,029
the value proposition an LPL advisor

340
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,210
brings. And what we want to strengthen

341
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,450
with our AI platform and tools is

342
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,364
make sure that. Advisors get the, the

343
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,484
gift of time so they can focus on

344
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,565
that relationship,

345
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,125
help their customers in moments that matter.

346
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:10,303
Moments where there's market volatility,

347
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:12,965
moments where your clients have high liquidity

348
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,315
needs, and not really focus on,

349
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:17,325
you know, administrative overload,

350
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,724
which tends to be some of the challenges we're

351
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,125
solving in this journey,

352
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,404
particularly for our wealth advisors.

353
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,038
I also want to take you through

354
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,340
our next slide, which,

355
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:29,139
and you know, this is basically,

356
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,739
you know, you don't have to read the entire thing, but

357
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:34,000
the context here is these are

358
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,158
the various news articles that have come

359
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,320
up in the last couple of years about

360
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,879
LPL.

361
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,690
And what I want to call out is, in the

362
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,139
last 3 to 5 years,

363
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,979
LPL as a firm

364
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,000
has doubled its AUM.

365
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,619
There are not many firms that grow in that

366
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,820
level of scale, and that's the

367
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,979
criticality here.

368
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,038
Not only there is scale, our stock

369
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:58,080
price has grown 351%.

370
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,830
Our adviser base has doubled in,

371
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,979
in the short 2+ years that I've

372
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,019
been there.

373
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,418
So, so for you to recognize that, you

374
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:08,619
know, we are supporting a platform

375
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:10,389
with an active user base,

376
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,940
our investor portal, which is one of the areas

377
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,918
that I manage.

378
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,729
Has about, you know,

379
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,109
2 million active users with a

380
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,109
projection of doubling that in the next couple

381
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,109
of years so there is tremendous

382
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:24,229
growth so the strategic levels that

383
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:24,989
this firm

384
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:27,590
has focused on are not just the organic

385
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,849
traditional growth model we're talking

386
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,989
about inorganic M&A and

387
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:33,029
aggressive M&A

388
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:36,000
so which explains why. My AI capabilities

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,139
are a core and crucial

390
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:39,798
in this type of transformation.

391
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:40,658
So that's,

392
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,700
um, I just want to pause here and ask the audience

393
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,859
question before we sort of

394
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,879
talk about the next piece.

395
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,298
Is there anybody here who thinks

396
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
that their industry will

397
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,879
not have to redefine the transformation journey?

398
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,058
Show me a hand.

399
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,190
OK, I made my point.

400
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:02,229
You know why.

401
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:06,558
All right, and I'm excited that we get to

402
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,739
build that together right as a group here.

403
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,119
So the four personas, so you

404
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,279
know, my, you know, our approach and sort of

405
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,119
solving this,

406
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,519
you know, AI first and AI led

407
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,879
journey is looking at the personas

408
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,658
we support

409
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,359
and I, I genuinely felt our brand

410
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,359
campaign was stolen by the way, the AWS

411
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,590
keynotes. Speaker, because what if we

412
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,629
could is LPL's brand

413
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,009
brand campaign just so everybody knows so

414
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,389
think about the persona first here which

415
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,849
is John who's the financial adviser

416
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:38,308
and what if we could make their life

417
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:39,908
about serving their clients

418
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,229
having you know showing that empathy and

419
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,229
trust in the relationship angle which is

420
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:45,190
what they excel about.

421
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,538
We don't need to,

422
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,099
you know, give them the administrative aspects

423
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:51,960
of, oh, you know, you have to manage your transactions

424
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,580
and support them through the day. They should be focused

425
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,979
on relationship advice,

426
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,859
give proactive personalized

427
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
information and faster response.

428
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:03,298
So we want to give them speed and personalization.

429
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,529
So that is the gift we want to solve with AI.

430
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,798
Think of our end investor.

431
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,320
So and and that is a persona probably

432
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,359
all of us wear, right? If you all have

433
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,149
bank accounts,

434
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,529
yeah, you know the end investor persona

435
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,879
and what do an end investor expects

436
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,359
from them? They want trust they want transparency

437
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,399
from their, you know, financial

438
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,759
institution they want seamless digital

439
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,619
experiences and most importantly,

440
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,940
including myself, they want outsized returns

441
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,899
and that's the piece we want to demonstrate.

442
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,080
And think of the 3rd persona, my most

443
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,908
favorite, because I wear the payments,

444
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,700
you know, hat in our organization.

445
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,440
And I can tell you, if you've ever worked

446
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,590
in operations,

447
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,119
you will understand this.

448
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,158
So, operations role, you know,

449
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,080
especially in the wealth management and financial services

450
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,109
industry, Has not digitized and

451
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,808
we haven't necessarily, I think,

452
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,168
you know, leverage AI to the level

453
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,710
that you could in terms of strengthening

454
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,219
the, you know, automation and the

455
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,389
operation, like taking out the manual workload

456
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,630
and the friction. So there's a great opportunity

457
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,630
for us to solve it.

458
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,049
And the last, as a technology

459
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,130
leader, core and you know, the

460
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,170
most personal

461
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,009
piece in this is we want to give time

462
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,009
back for our developers to focus on

463
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,309
innovation and not really routine

464
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,880
tasks.

465
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,529
My two favorite tasks I really, really hope

466
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,108
we can digitize very soon,

467
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:25,969
getting rid of that pen test, the manual

468
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:28,068
pen test, and release management.

469
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,858
You know, make sure that

470
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:33,170
nobody has to use Jira and focus

471
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,118
on innovation.

472
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:37,219
So that's, that's, that's the gift we want, we are aspiring

473
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:38,578
to give. So,

474
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:41,338
you know, I'll just take you through. So, any,

475
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,618
any of these transformations, as you can see,

476
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:45,358
right, you have to start small.

477
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:48,789
You know, demonstrate those quick wins

478
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,519
and then you march into

479
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:53,189
a longer sort of, you know, iterative

480
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:54,689
journey and strengthen that.

481
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,059
So I want to take you through 4 such

482
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,059
use cases that are right now

483
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,000
in the works

484
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,500
and have become sort of crucial

485
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,539
for us to illustrate on the KPIs

486
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,799
and see how we can measure the impact of

487
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,259
AI AI and digitization at

488
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,402
LPL. So the first one is our. Banking

489
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,442
wizard. I'm sorry because I can't

490
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,442
really zoom into the content, but I

491
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,482
can talk through there

492
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:17,902
so this is a tool

493
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,402
where we have an Amazon, you know,

494
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:22,642
uh, Bedrock LLM behind the scene

495
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,041
that connects to our knowledge base like Jira

496
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,021
Confluence,

497
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,462
and in essence this was built

498
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:30,642
by our banking team because we just launched

499
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,642
our flagship cash management

500
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,722
account. So LPL supports a lot of

501
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:35,781
investment products

502
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,505
insurance. Products but most recently

503
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,905
we've launched our banking solutions,

504
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,526
um, and this

505
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,224
was launched within a year, right? And

506
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,445
I'm really incredibly proud of that win because,

507
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,685
you know, bringing a product to life

508
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:52,144
especially in in that short window

509
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,435
and making sure it is launched successfully,

510
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,984
you know, it it it the only we could do is

511
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:59,224
with the tools like AI that can improve our

512
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:01,586
productivity and get us to the outcomes

513
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,680
we need. And what's important with

514
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,920
this particular product is

515
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
we've been able to showcase that, hey, there

516
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,559
is an

517
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
information layer that we can provide to

518
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,759
our service partners so that every time they

519
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,880
need to understand who's eligible for

520
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,588
this account,

521
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,930
where does thing, where do things stand, there

522
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,799
is a tool for them.

523
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,574
Need to really like reach out to their

524
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:25,364
product or support or multiple layers of the

525
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,654
organization and that's the OR and efficiency

526
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:28,924
it was able to accomplish.

527
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,755
The second one, which is account view, um,

528
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,775
and this is an effort that's massively in

529
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:36,144
progress. Socount View happens to be LPL's

530
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:38,035
customer facing investor portal.

531
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,630
And what we are trying to do that in that

532
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,640
particular space is,

533
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,430
we have close to 160+

534
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,449
endpoints, we're supporting a portal

535
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,368
and a very vast user base,

536
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,670
and that is the one we want to take through a

537
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,670
digital transformation journey. A lot

538
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,568
of our code,

539
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:55,229
you know, templates and,

540
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,219
libraries are being transformed. And

541
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:00,519
for most of you who've migrated

542
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,630
workloads to cloud, you probably would have

543
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,640
seen, you, you know, about the 7

544
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,789
hours, right? And we have probably most

545
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,959
of those in that platform. It's not just

546
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,838
a lift and shift. So there's a massive rearchitecture

547
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:12,400
as well.

548
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,750
And AI has been incredibly useful for

549
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,180
us in that journey.

550
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:19,059
The next one is there are net new capabilities

551
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,140
that we are launching, lending being

552
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,920
one of those

553
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,338
operations, which I spoke about is one of the persona

554
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,799
that massively has

555
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,219
manual surveillances and manual

556
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,368
review document review, and that is

557
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:33,000
an area that is of key focus,

558
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,904
which we are. Strengthening using,

559
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,223
you know, agents. And the last one

560
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:39,443
is developer efficiencies.

561
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:41,805
So we have a lot of opportunities

562
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,045
and some of the developers are in this

563
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,125
room, which I'm excited to see, especially

564
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,555
folks who are using cursor, co-pilot,

565
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,045
and, and a lot of the bedrock solution.

566
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:53,844
So these are the teams that are able to leverage

567
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,884
the power of these things and

568
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:57,924
especially use them for test automation,

569
00:20:58,473 --> 00:20:59,233
generation of code,

570
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,525
and which we are incredibly excited to see

571
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,703
and what that could bring.

572
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,689
I'll take you through a couple of, you know, futuristic

573
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,229
use cases that are right now in the incubation,

574
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:11,670
and the reason why they're interesting is

575
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,289
the potential it can solve for our firm. For

576
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,309
example, like we're we're looking into a payment

577
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,509
exception handler,

578
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:19,880
given the operations overhead that we

579
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,529
have, something that can resolve the exceptions.

580
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,729
Let, let's call that payment superhero.

581
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:27,400
The next one is we're talking about our co-pilot

582
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,769
for our back office team.

583
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,160
So, and this is something, you know, that's

584
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,549
really critical, especially there's a lot of

585
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,578
information and acronyms that they need to look up,

586
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,098
and we could use that.

587
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,439
And then the very last one, which is an area

588
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,640
I think I've heard from the other panelists

589
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,729
as well, is the opportunity here

590
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:46,650
to solve financial crimes, the fraud monitoring,

591
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,358
and making sure we can do our anti-money laundering

592
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,358
using AI. So those are the things that are in the

593
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:51,880
works.

594
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,019
Like all transformation goals, I

595
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:58,380
want to make sure that we talk about a critical

596
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,680
topic, especially in an industry where

597
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:03,219
we are highly regulated, which is our governance

598
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,088
and controls,

599
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,828
and we are trying to execute the strategy

600
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:09,299
with the right governance model, ethics,

601
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:11,759
guard rails, and compliance

602
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,019
tools so that we can make sure we deliver

603
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:14,818
it right,

604
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,939
because trust in this industry is non-negotiable.

605
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,088
So that's really where we are.

606
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,930
And then to sum it up, right? So

607
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,469
I want to make sure that we bring

608
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,729
this whole story together.

609
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,689
So we just talked about

610
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,199
that LPL is committed to deliver differentiated

611
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,750
services to our customers.

612
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,338
We want to bring that through personalization.

613
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,380
We want to digitize the entire experience.

614
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,930
We've talked about the tremendous growth story

615
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,449
there and how we have, you know, the AUM

616
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,449
and the affiliation models

617
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,568
that we need to support. So that is where

618
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,880
we are using the power of AI. The tools

619
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:52,068
to support that.

620
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:55,019
Operation simplification is a critical

621
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,430
area and there's a lot,

622
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,140
lot of opportunity there that we could strengthen.

623
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,500
And finally, bringing technology to

624
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,739
the forefront, right? And how you achieve that

625
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,959
in a scalable, sustainable way.

626
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:08,779
I want to put this thought to

627
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,858
everybody. You know, when we

628
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,539
talk about transformation, right,

629
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,019
you know, AI is, you know, probably

630
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,219
the lever we are using. Think of it, you're

631
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:18,519
launching your rocket ship,

632
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:21,130
you have your greatest tech stack, you're

633
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,199
finding the right business problem to solve.

634
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,699
AI is your fuel.

635
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,660
If you don't introduce that, your rocket's

636
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,699
not taking anywhere.

637
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:31,180
So just make sure, you know, you keep that in

638
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,219
mind. I would love to hear

639
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:35,219
from this group on where you, where

640
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,368
things stand. Is your rocket, rocket

641
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,420
in your space station, or is it

642
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:39,959
basically,

643
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,459
you know, launched and in outer space.

644
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,750
So I look forward to hearing from these

645
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,939
folks in this room, and thank you.

646
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,769
That was, uh, pretty impressive, uh, stats

647
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:04,368
about LPL and all that. I don't, I work for Truist,

648
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,979
uh, we're, uh,

649
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,068
we're, uh,

650
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,449
we're on a similar journey, on a similar journey with,

651
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,509
uh, digital and AI transformation. We're coming

652
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:12,489
out of a pretty

653
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,469
significant merger of two regional

654
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:16,549
institutions, so it's, uh.

655
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,068
More even more important, even more pivotal for

656
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,348
us to adopt AI, adopt, uh,

657
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:23,430
you know, digital transformation, but, uh,

658
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,868
we're, we're focused on, uh, serving

659
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:26,989
multiple clients. We,

660
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,509
we, we run multiple businesses, mortgage,

661
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:30,848
digital banking,

662
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:33,309
uh, commercial lending, payments,

663
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,509
uh, wholesale banking, wealth management. We're

664
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:38,029
about a $570

665
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,699
billion institution. Um,

666
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:40,699
Trust is,

667
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,108
but, uh, so thank you very much for the

668
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,108
opportunity today. Uh, excited to be here.

669
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:47,469
Thank you Infosys uh for, for hosting

670
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:49,509
us. Uh, what I'm gonna do is I'm

671
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,568
gonna, I'm gonna talk about, um,

672
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:52,828
the,

673
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,390
I'm not gonna talk about the use cases. I'm gonna

674
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,670
talk about our blueprint for AI strategy

675
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,088
from a technology standpoint.

676
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,140
Anybody

677
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,799
who has run platforms and capabilities probably

678
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,920
can relate to this. We're always one tool away from

679
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,140
greatness, right? Just get that one tool

680
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:09,420
we'll be in business,

681
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,959
uh, by the way, this is, uh, proprietary and

682
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,000
it is, uh, you know, you're gonna have to

683
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,568
pay me a cent to use it every time.

684
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,930
So, uh, we, we, while I'm, while I'm

685
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,519
exaggerating a little bit,

686
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,598
um,

687
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,059
I'm not really exaggerating, right? You know, we were

688
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,539
in, uh, uh, uh, one of the greatest conferences

689
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,199
in the world

690
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:29,259
for 2, for a couple of days.

691
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:31,939
How many new capabilities have come out? We have

692
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,420
seen so many capabilities come out and

693
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,750
everything is moving at lightning pace. I mean, literally

694
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,098
at lightning pace, I think.

695
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,900
So we have to, we have to focus on integrations.

696
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,299
That's the name of our game.

697
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,959
We are trying to, uh, we're just talking to,

698
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,239
you know, we're just talking to the Nat NatWest

699
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:47,858
partners here.

700
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:50,828
Do you take the data to the AI or do you take

701
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,920
AI to the data? That's, uh, you know, I

702
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,949
don't know, I literally a billion dollar, billion

703
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:55,910
dollar question,

704
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:58,420
but, uh, we are trying to, our,

705
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,420
our, uh, strategy

706
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,078
has been to move in the, in

707
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,420
the direction of faster integrations,

708
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,489
um.

709
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:08,209
And um

710
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,858
This is sort of like how we're anchoring

711
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:12,519
our overall approach to

712
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,979
uh to run uh you know we want to

713
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:16,979
be able to accelerate our use case

714
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:19,098
backlog and for us to be able to

715
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:21,180
do that um we are looking at

716
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,358
a multi-pronged approach

717
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:24,939
that allows, you know, for us to choose the right

718
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,979
tools for the right job at the right,

719
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,660
you know, sort of like pace as well

720
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,299
so we are heavily, heavily again we are heavily

721
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,420
focused on integrations we want to scale

722
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,500
AI we want to bring

723
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,779
everything cohesively together so we're focusing

724
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,420
on. Uh, an enterprise blueprint

725
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,439
that can bring all these things together. So

726
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:44,719
the way we see it, right, the way we see sort of like,

727
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,739
uh, generative AI, genetic A, all of these

728
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,890
things, I can probably put it in three categories.

729
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:51,098
One is our own personal knowledge

730
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:52,000
domains. We have

731
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:54,785
the places we work at have. Tremendous

732
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,025
knowledge domains. It could be, it could be ticketing

733
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,025
data. It could be Jira. It

734
00:26:59,025 --> 00:26:59,834
could be anything.

735
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,375
Uh, there's tremendous amount of knowledge domains

736
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,693
to be built out and we want to implement, you know,

737
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,025
use cases on top of those things. So

738
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,265
we were, we're treating those as, as, as one

739
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,164
particular domain

740
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:12,473
and then there are so many other products that enable AI

741
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:14,664
you, you have to be able to adapt to those

742
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:15,483
products as well.

743
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,180
There are platforms. Platforms come with every

744
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,199
single, you know, entity, every single

745
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,739
sort of like, um, uh, application,

746
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:23,699
every single product,

747
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,140
everything has AI enablement. You have to be

748
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,759
able to

749
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,059
take advantage of all of these things and you have to

750
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,539
be able to do it intelligently again

751
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,259
through integrations.

752
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:34,709
So, um,

753
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:37,029
just a little bit of an eye chart, but kinda,

754
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,108
kinda, you know,

755
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,449
what I've tried to do here is to highlight.

756
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,630
Uh, on the left, you're gonna, well, on

757
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,160
my left, I guess, uh.

758
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,358
Yeah you're gonna see like the uh

759
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:49,578
the um

760
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,500
enterprise blueprint

761
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,118
uh for uh generative AI solutions

762
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:56,318
and on the right here to my right you're gonna see

763
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,598
you know uh a blueprint for uh traditional

764
00:27:58,598 --> 00:28:00,598
AI. What we wanna try and

765
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:02,759
do here is we want to, we want to

766
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,500
uh have

767
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,000
an enterprise knowledge domain that

768
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,108
powers both of these things. We want to be able

769
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:08,880
to invest

770
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,318
heavily and provide.

771
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:13,029
You know, super critical, really good

772
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,390
experiences for the knowledge domain experts

773
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,739
for them to be able to bring in the knowledge,

774
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:19,420
manage it, curate it,

775
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,828
make it available for not only for

776
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:24,118
models but also for generative AI solutions.

777
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,289
So we're focusing heavily on the

778
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,848
experience for the knowledge experts as well.

779
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,469
So that's the sort of like the, the.

780
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,660
Bedrock, you know,

781
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,219
uh, for, for a, for a lack of a better term, that's, that's,

782
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:38,309
that's what is driving everything for us under

783
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:40,309
there. And then from there, you know,

784
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,219
we have 3,

785
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm, I'm not gonna read through all of these things. You can look

786
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,989
at it. We have a platform layer that is focused

787
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,989
on, you know, sort of leveraging

788
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,269
the enterprise platforms that are available. We,

789
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,549
we use, you know, we're sort of like trying

790
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:53,130
to be

791
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,789
as agnostic as possible, but, you know, we

792
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:57,789
use things like Bedrock and Sagemaker,

793
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,029
uh, pretty heavily for our, uh, for our,

794
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:02,328
um. Model development as far

795
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:04,549
as well as for our um um

796
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,239
generative solution development.

797
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:09,029
Where we have a component layer in between

798
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:11,390
that helps with orchestration that helps with

799
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,088
sort of like trying to pull everything together

800
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:16,459
component wise and then we have a

801
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,588
framework where we can bring different types

802
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:21,029
of experiences. For example, if you want a rag

803
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,108
use case, you, you can, you can sort of like

804
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:24,670
bring the rag use cases in there.

805
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:27,549
You can bring agentic platforms and get them integrated

806
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,750
there if you want to move towards MCPs,

807
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,084
you can get those. Integrated as well. So this is

808
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,144
the direction in which we are trying to move

809
00:29:34,684 --> 00:29:37,084
and as well as, you know, when you, when you go to the traditional

810
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:38,394
model development side,

811
00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:40,805
we want to have, uh, an experience of the people

812
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,005
that train the models as well. It's not just a

813
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:44,664
question of serving up the models for

814
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:47,525
applications to use. We have to have a platform for

815
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,125
the model training as well. So

816
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:51,525
we're trying to put all of these things

817
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,295
under a common UI.

818
00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:54,943
We want, uh, a good distinctive,

819
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:57,525
uh, reliable use, uh, field

820
00:29:57,525 --> 00:29:59,765
for all of these things. So we're trying to prioritize that

821
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,574
experience as well.

822
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,098
Uh, for the people that are developing

823
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:05,219
the models, for the people that are developing knowledge

824
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:06,880
bases. So this is, this is

825
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,519
the enterprise blueprint that we're looking at.

826
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kinda summarize

827
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,640
all of these things, um,

828
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,328
this is again, there's a lot of words in here,

829
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,578
but we are,

830
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,400
we are trying to use native AI, we're

831
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,640
trying to use vendor enabled AI, we're trying to use

832
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,759
platform enabled AI.

833
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,930
And we want to bring everything together.

834
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:29,969
We want to scale. We want to have the

835
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:32,009
right tool for the right platform

836
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,199
for the right use case.

837
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,250
So whether it is a question of, you know, leveraging

838
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,489
Cortex from Snowflake, the ability

839
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:41,118
to do that, or whether it's a question of leveraging,

840
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,729
you know, automation platforms that have embedded

841
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:46,078
UI, so or embedded automation,

842
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,130
sorry, embedded AI,

843
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,309
we're trying to bring all of those things together

844
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,328
and we want to scale. Like I want

845
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,529
to close this. I wanna close this, and I wanna talk

846
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:56,519
about like. we are,

847
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,439
we are prioritizing

848
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,019
integrations to, to drive

849
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,469
our 150+

850
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,660
use cases backlog,

851
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,019
and the only way to do that is to be able

852
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:08,959
to, is to be able to scale.

853
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:11,348
We're prioritizing scaling,

854
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,618
cohesiveness and using the right tool for

855
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,059
the right job for us.

856
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:18,390
Thank you.

857
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:30,299
I. So,

858
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:32,309
hi there, thank you, thank you for having me.

859
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,150
Um, so my name's Jennifer Scott and I

860
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,269
look after the digital banking platform for

861
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,588
the commercial and institutional franchise

862
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:40,529
within NatWest.

863
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:43,828
So NatWest, as Diana said, is a

864
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,430
leading UK bank,

865
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:48,029
uh, that focuses on retail,

866
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,489
business, and wealth customer base.

867
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,229
The commercial and institutional franchise

868
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:56,799
specifically focuses on our business customers,

869
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:58,239
so we serve

870
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:00,670
business customers all the way from small SMEs

871
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,568
up to large,

872
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:02,809
um,

873
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:04,029
institutional clients.

874
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,848
My role there really as head of engineering

875
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:09,828
of the digital platform

876
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,469
is to look at

877
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:14,930
our customer and our colleague digital journeys,

878
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,009
uh, and in particular, we're focused on the transformation

879
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:20,130
of a platform called Bankline

880
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,650
today.

881
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,729
Um, so I'll, I'll talk to you a little bit about that.

882
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,979
So what is Bankline? Bankline is

883
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,568
a digital platform that allows

884
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:32,799
customers to access

885
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,680
accounts and payments capabilities

886
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:38,900
across three channels, so mobile, web,

887
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:39,920
and API.

888
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,068
Typically our smaller

889
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,650
SME businesses will interact with the

890
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,848
mobile platform, um, then

891
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:49,259
our mid-market,

892
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:51,828
uh, corporate treasury functions will,

893
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:53,910
will access the, the web platform.

894
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:55,910
They'll also use the mobile platform,

895
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,328
uh, for mobile payments, checking balances

896
00:32:58,328 --> 00:32:59,588
on the go, etc.

897
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,368
um, and then our

898
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:03,930
more larger institutional customers

899
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,289
will connect to us via our API

900
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,130
platforms.

901
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,680
The customers that we service typically

902
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,009
have a turnover in the range of 7500

903
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,719
to 500 million.

904
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,328
Um,

905
00:33:18,828 --> 00:33:20,858
the platform is, is, is

906
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:22,930
critical in serving that customer base.

907
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,180
At the end of 2024,

908
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:28,150
we had approximately

909
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:31,209
370,000 users, and

910
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,608
we were processing transactions in and around

911
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,949
circa 27.6 million

912
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:36,789
um per month.

913
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,009
So it's a fairly, it's a fairly critical platform.

914
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:43,130
It was launched in

915
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:44,799
1995.

916
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,430
So, you know, over the last three decades,

917
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,630
it has been a cornerstone of our

918
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,250
success.

919
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:53,380
Um, but obviously, during that time, both

920
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,769
customer and

921
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,789
technology has really evolved dramatically.

922
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,910
So, today, customers

923
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,068
expect to interact with us over digital

924
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:03,250
ecosystems.

925
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:06,509
They want a digital experience that,

926
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:07,368
um,

927
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,289
Is both connected, intuitive,

928
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,639
you know, easy to use.

929
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,010
That's effectively what we want to deliver with this

930
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,869
transformation.

931
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,829
So our ambition

932
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,688
to achieve that digital experience that our customers

933
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,260
want,

934
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,809
and also to ensure that we have a platform

935
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:26,789
for the future,

936
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:29,449
we created 3 strategic objectives

937
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,429
to steer the transformation work.

938
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,610
So the first one, digital customer journeys,

939
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,128
looks to deliver a unified

940
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,628
customer experience

941
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:39,909
across

942
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:42,489
all of the journeys, uh, that our customers

943
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,570
use, um.

944
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,789
Covering both mobile web and API.

945
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,907
The single point of access piece is basically

946
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:51,989
looking to provide frictionless access

947
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,608
to our products and services.

948
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,639
So through Bankline,

949
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,199
accessing more products and services from behind

950
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,300
a single logon.

951
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:01,760
And the third one,

952
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,059
increased pace of delivery.

953
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,918
So how can we, through the

954
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,239
technology transformation through a migration to cloud,

955
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,860
look to deliver more capability more often

956
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,978
to our customers?

957
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,378
So, a really key point for us

958
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,280
was thinking about the transformation, not just in the

959
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,360
context of the technology that we

960
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,398
want to move to, but how do we continue

961
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,478
to deliver value for our customers.

962
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:29,679
And that's obviously critical in terms of

963
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:31,070
Um,

964
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,438
the customer experience keeping our

965
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,840
business stakeholders, you know, engaged

966
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,000
and supportive across, across the transformation

967
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,840
duration,

968
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:41,260
um, so, so fairly critical. So

969
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,639
in terms of doing that, we created some sort of

970
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,679
simple, powerful indicators to track

971
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,719
both our progress and also the value that

972
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,019
we're delivering to customers.

973
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:52,639
The first one of those was a percentage of

974
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,250
the customer journeys that

975
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:57,110
um have been modernized that have

976
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,349
received, uh, you know, the digital experience

977
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,128
has been updated for our customers.

978
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,869
The second of which

979
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,510
was the number of customer journeys that we've actually

980
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,929
migrated to cloud.

981
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:08,889
And the 3rd,

982
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:11,228
the number of products that we've integrated

983
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:13,418
through Bankline and sit behind that single log

984
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:15,840
on. We,

985
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,079
we sort of focused as well on trying to

986
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,119
think about what are the table stack capabilities

987
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,320
that our customers would expect from a commercial banking

988
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,360
platform, um, and that

989
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,219
sort of drove us to prioritize,

990
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:29,418
uh, solving for customer pain points

991
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,159
and actually looking to reduce

992
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,199
our reliance on our customer

993
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,458
support desks as well.

994
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,079
So,

995
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,780
Over the course of the last two years, I think

996
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,090
the results really speak for themselves. So,

997
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,969
you'll see on the slide here, the sort of the 4

998
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,978
sort of 4 main points surround progress to

999
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:48,619
date. So,

1000
00:36:48,898 --> 00:36:50,938
digital service requests have increased

1001
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:52,938
by 60% over the course of the last 2

1002
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:53,780
years. So

1003
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,219
our customers are having sort of faster, more

1004
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,280
efficient interactions with us.

1005
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:01,050
We've delivered a single platform for,

1006
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,139
for mobile

1007
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,079
that covers all of our, um, brands

1008
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,679
that allows us to do updates more quickly.

1009
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,659
And have a consistent offering to our

1010
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:11,349
customer base.

1011
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,648
Um, we've integrated key products,

1012
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:17,070
uh, through the bank line platform. So,

1013
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:19,708
for example, asset finance,

1014
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,668
um, foreign exchange,

1015
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:24,228
um, corporate credit cards, to name a few.

1016
00:37:24,648 --> 00:37:26,978
So, you know, they're more readily accessible,

1017
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:29,250
uh, and actually reducing friction and, and

1018
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,789
really keeping customers within our ecosystem,

1019
00:37:31,938 --> 00:37:34,148
which is, um, beneficial for all.

1020
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,188
And all of that's been underpinned by that continued

1021
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:39,769
delivery through of customer workloads

1022
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:40,530
onto cloud.

1023
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,250
Um, that sort of underpins all that capability.

1024
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,500
So the key to unlocking

1025
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,559
the transformation has been

1026
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,099
migrating to a

1027
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,619
cloud architecture.

1028
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,769
Um,

1029
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,329
the complexity that we faced when

1030
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:02,449
we started the program was having a,

1031
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,958
you know, sort of very manual,

1032
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:06,750
a very legacy code base,

1033
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:09,809
um, you know, that's been compiled over decades,

1034
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,289
having manual deployments into

1035
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,389
production that take quite a long period of time,

1036
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,800
and also having a very long lead time, uh,

1037
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,869
of delivery of value to customers.

1038
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,398
So the process,

1039
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,829
so the solution to all of this really was to move

1040
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,989
to a cloud architecture

1041
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,148
that would give us that

1042
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,429
faster delivery,

1043
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,110
um, increased resilience across

1044
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,239
the platform, and also the ability to

1045
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,349
have capacity on demand.

1046
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,820
So we adopted a repeatable

1047
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,099
approach that saw us focus on pilot

1048
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:41,840
customer journeys to begin with.

1049
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,148
These were really designed to

1050
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,489
increase our learning, um, across

1051
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:49,769
the developer community, but also

1052
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,809
to build confidence as, as we went,

1053
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,369
um, and then we migrated to more

1054
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,849
critical applications.

1055
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,918
Releasing more complex capability, for

1056
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,019
example, multi-site resiliency

1057
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,820
to support those journeys,

1058
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,458
and then, uh, we delivered a

1059
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,050
uh internal developer platform which

1060
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,840
allowed our developers to,

1061
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,478
um, you know, deploy independently

1062
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:14,519
and safely, which is critical in achieving

1063
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,878
that agility of uh release

1064
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:17,619
cadence.

1065
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,320
So overall, uh, we've had

1066
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,668
much faster deliveries. Uh, we've had,

1067
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,438
you know, much greater resilience across the platform.

1068
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,878
We're aiming to be, you know, sort of zero downtime

1069
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:31,179
by the time we reach the end of the transformation.

1070
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,179
And,

1071
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:34,519
um, we've been able to experiment safely.

1072
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,659
So progressive

1073
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,699
releases, AB testing,

1074
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,750
all the while sort of maintaining regulatory confidence

1075
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,860
in, in what we're doing.

1076
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,780
I'm, I'm finally,

1077
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,610
uh,

1078
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,398
talking about how we've used AI to sort of accelerate

1079
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:52,019
the transformation. So we've done that in 4 key ways.

1080
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,519
The first code analysis, so.

1081
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:57,289
Reviewing all of those complex legacy

1082
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:58,090
code bases,

1083
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,250
producing dependencies,

1084
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,849
dependency maps across those so our developers

1085
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,398
can understand the landscape,

1086
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,250
documentation generation, so providing structured

1087
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,079
context aware

1088
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,099
documentation that

1089
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,449
are Again, our, our, uh,

1090
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,469
developer community,

1091
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:14,550
you know, can,

1092
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,849
can interact with that documentation and really

1093
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,519
understand the code base that they're transforming.

1094
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:20,929
Migration planning,

1095
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,989
so using AI insights

1096
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:25,228
to phase the deliveries,

1097
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,188
um,

1098
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,969
bringing into that business priorities

1099
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,128
and code complexity so that we've got, you

1100
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:31,949
know, uh,

1101
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,769
a safe way of, of executing the migration

1102
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:37,090
plan. And finally, code refactoring.

1103
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,250
So conversion of those

1104
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,570
legacy code bases to modern

1105
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,530
code bases.

1106
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:44,929
Again, you know, producing code

1107
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:46,929
that is understandable, maintainable as

1108
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:48,550
we go forward is fairly critical.

1109
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:51,469
So I think those four things really combined

1110
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:53,628
to reduce the complexity that we've had to deal with,

1111
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,280
you know, shorten the timelines of the delivery,

1112
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,829
um, allowing the developers, I think has

1113
00:40:58,829 --> 00:40:59,728
been mentioned before,

1114
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:02,809
you know, to focus on delivering customer value

1115
00:41:03,188 --> 00:41:03,909
and.

1116
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:05,639
Uh,

1117
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,429
yeah, just effectively, you know, delivering

1118
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:10,469
that digital experience that we want to and

1119
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,530
not spending our time

1120
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,228
untangling decades old code

1121
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:14,809
bases.

1122
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,079
So I think, um, in summary,

1123
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,458
the transformation has been more than

1124
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,139
just a technology transformation. It's been

1125
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:25,510
how can we deliver the digital experience that

1126
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,760
our customers need

1127
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,199
and also how do we deliver a

1128
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,159
platform that's ready for the future

1129
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:33,179
and meets our needs going forward.

1130
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,760
So thank you for your time.
