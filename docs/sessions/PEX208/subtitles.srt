1
00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:02,890
Today we're gonna talk about how AWS

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,969
channel partners and their end customers

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,530
can transform their business and deliver

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,929
more joint success

5
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:11,448
using new AWS service called Billing

6
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:12,079
Transfer.

7
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,000
Billing transfer introduces a new era

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,298
for AWS channel partner billing

9
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:19,298
and governance.

10
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,649
There are 3 key benefits that we'll cover

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,359
today. First,

12
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:26,728
channel partners and their end customers now

13
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:28,809
will have enhanced security

14
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:29,568
autonomy.

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,520
End customers of channel partners can now

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,939
operate in an entirely separate

17
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,439
organization from their reseller. This

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,700
allows both of these two entities

19
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:42,380
to self-control their own AWS

20
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,168
organization. Second,

21
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:46,709
billing transfer will simplify

22
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,149
billing operations for channel partners

23
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,719
because partners shared organizations

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,039
with their end customers before using billing

25
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,609
transfer.

26
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,219
Partners had to proliferate their

27
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,880
organizations and manage billing across hundreds

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,689
of organizations. You can now consolidate

29
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,790
billing in a single organization

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,088
across all end customers.

31
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:08,918
Lastly,

32
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,528
using billing transfer, partners can now

33
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:13,569
protect their proprietary discounts

34
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:14,388
and rates

35
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,448
away from their end customers. The bills

36
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,638
and chargeable billing artifacts are delivered

37
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:20,790
exclusively

38
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,349
to the partner in their own organization,

39
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,870
while customers

40
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,329
maintain self governance in their in

41
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,650
a separate organization.

42
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,799
Before we dive into the problems that

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,859
resulted in the need

44
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,959
for billing transfer, we have to understand

45
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,260
the existing AWS account

46
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,120
construct.

47
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,808
Within AWS organizations there are

48
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:44,159
two types of accounts.

49
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,930
There's a management account and a member

50
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,469
account.

51
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,189
The management account today

52
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,609
has full administrative control over

53
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,609
the organization. It can establish things

54
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,808
like service control policies. It

55
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,930
manages multi-account governance settings

56
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,028
like guard duty,

57
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,269
control tower, landing zones,

58
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,808
but that same account is responsible

59
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:06,189
for billing in the entire organization.

60
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,110
This means that for channel partners to manage

61
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,550
billing for end customers, they traditionally

62
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,808
had to control this management account

63
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,349
while end customers operated within the member

64
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:16,939
accounts.

65
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,020
What this resulted in

66
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:21,419
is various conflicts over

67
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,558
that administrative access control

68
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,020
in the management account.

69
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,758
Channel partners and end customers had to compromise

70
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,338
over partner control of the management account

71
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:31,679
in order for them to have

72
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,058
billing access,

73
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,379
while end customers then delegate away

74
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,460
all of their governance controls as well

75
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,740
and creates a security risk for many end

76
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,099
customers working under channel partners.

77
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,838
It also results in operational

78
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,919
inefficiencies where partners

79
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,080
now have to create dozens or hundreds

80
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,199
of organizations, retrieve billing

81
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,849
artifacts at the end of every month from those

82
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,939
organizations, and make payments there

83
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,099
just to manage their multi-account,

84
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,219
uh, reselling business.

85
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,308
And lastly, together these create scalability

86
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,389
challenges for partners. It's harder

87
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,750
to close deals because you have to convince

88
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,008
every end customer

89
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:12,508
why the channel partner needs to control route

90
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,849
to the management account,

91
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,490
and it's harder to manage your customer base

92
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,750
because the channel partners have to go into

93
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,960
all of these separate accounts

94
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,349
to manage billing and configure management

95
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,288
account level settings for their end customers.

96
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,770
That's why we're excited to introduce

97
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,939
billing transfer, which is now generally

98
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,118
available through AWS billing and

99
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:35,189
cost management

100
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:36,149
today.

101
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:38,969
Billing transfer allows the management

102
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,868
account of one organization

103
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,270
to delegate its billing to a separate

104
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,849
AWS organization.

105
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,599
This allows channel partners and end customers

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,000
to now operate in separate organizations

107
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,199
while the partner exclusively manages

108
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,199
billing and the end customer does not

109
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,199
have to compromise on control of

110
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,399
their own organization.

111
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:01,949
Billing transfer gives partners a

112
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,750
few key benefits. First, centralized

113
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,569
management,

114
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,028
which allows you to manage multiple

115
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,258
end customers from a single partner account

116
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:11,699
which will receive bills.

117
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,788
It allows you to have privacy of your margins

118
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,869
without sac without asking

119
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,949
end customers to sacrifice control of

120
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,069
their own management accounts as those

121
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,069
chargeable artifacts are delivered exclusively

122
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:23,850
to the partner.

123
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:27,048
And together it gives you operational efficiency

124
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,170
where you no longer have to manage hundreds of accounts

125
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,069
for customers.

126
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,100
For end customers, they now can have

127
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
complete environment control. There's

128
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,750
no more

129
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:38,629
trade-off when onboarding to a reseller

130
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,509
through the channel programs.

131
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,088
They also for the first time have

132
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:45,769
cost visibility through native AWS

133
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,129
cost management tooling.

134
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,769
This means your end customers can now also

135
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,928
use Cost Explorer cost and usage

136
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:53,970
reports and soon will also be able to

137
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,889
use cost anomaly detection RISP

138
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,389
reports within their own separate

139
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,790
organization while procuring through the channel partner.

140
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,298
Together these make those sales

141
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:05,269
conversations easier.

142
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,838
We're making it an even playing field

143
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,838
for partners to compete to,

144
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,889
uh, deliver services to end

145
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:12,588
customers.

146
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,509
So how does this work in the billing

147
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:16,569
and cost management

148
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,730
experience?

149
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,470
You can see now the partner and customer

150
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,829
are in two separate organizations. It's

151
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,108
no longer a shared organization where member

152
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,250
accounts are separated to customers.

153
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,829
Within the customer organization, they

154
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,949
will not receive any invoices or

155
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,428
bills from AWS.

156
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,428
They will be able to view costs at the rates

157
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:38,809
that are determined by the solution provider.

158
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:41,389
So using AWS billing conductor, solution

159
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:43,629
providers will be able to show custom rates

160
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,129
to that end customer or public pricing rates.

161
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,949
The partner will receive chargeable

162
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,059
AWS invoices with the

163
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,588
actual price they pay,

164
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:55,230
and they can view chargeable or pro

165
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,329
forma costs.

166
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,670
So that means the partner can actually view

167
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,730
the cost explorer experience

168
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,230
that the end customer has in their management

169
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,548
account. This allows you to toggle

170
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:06,470
between those two,

171
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:07,678
and you'll do that

172
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,000
through AWS Cost Explorer.

173
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,459
Billing transfer also allows you to

174
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,579
centralize billing delivery to a

175
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,980
single management account

176
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:19,000
across multiple customers.

177
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,528
So in this example,

178
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:24,209
the partner here would receive 4 invoices,

179
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,488
one for the consumption within each of your

180
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:27,350
customers

181
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,689
and one for the partner's own consumption in

182
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,350
their internal organization.

183
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,730
This allows you to maintain segregation

184
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,730
of those bills,

185
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,358
use your existing integrations with,

186
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,519
uh, third party billing tools to

187
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,838
determine the re-rating to your end customers,

188
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,678
all while customers maintain their separate

189
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:45,329
organizations.

190
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,019
Billing transfer is available

191
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:51,278
through the billing and cost management

192
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,649
uh console in AWS.

193
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,420
Within the billing cost management console, you can

194
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,420
send invitations to invite end

195
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,660
customers to transfer their billing

196
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,019
to you. You can also centralize

197
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,379
manage your centralized invoice delivery

198
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,569
and payments.

199
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,970
You can switch between the views your end

200
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,059
customer has and the views the partner

201
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,298
has of their chargeable rates, and you can

202
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:16,079
set custom pricing to show to your end customers.

203
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:18,858
Along with this, we've also launched

204
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:21,149
an entirely new AWS Partner

205
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,600
Central experience.

206
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,220
So in AWS Partner Central,

207
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,410
we've made it easier for you to now

208
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:29,588
qualify for channel benefits and

209
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:31,988
channel discounts on your end customers'

210
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:32,699
consumption.

211
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,709
You can manage all of your accounts that

212
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:36,329
you use

213
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,699
against your channel programs in

214
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,649
one place.

215
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,100
You can self-activate these accounts.

216
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,309
No more waiting for any manual approvals

217
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,350
from AWS,

218
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,899
and you can establish relationships

219
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,238
with customers once per

220
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:52,470
organization. You no longer have to complete

221
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,910
end user reporting on every single customer

222
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,428
account.

223
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,269
Tell us who the customer is once at their management

224
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,350
account level, and that will be inherited by

225
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,428
all of the member accounts in the

226
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,858
organization. This new partner central

227
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,139
experience is also

228
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,459
fully enabled by public

229
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,500
APIs that you can integrate with

230
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,858
to report on your channel ecosystem

231
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,939
and customer base from your own

232
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,019
CRM or first party tooling.

233
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,699
There are also new APIs in billing and

234
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,858
cost management that will allow you

235
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,858
to automate the

236
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,858
billing operations and onboarding of

237
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:27,000
end customers

238
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,778
through billing transfer.

239
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,340
Let's hear from our partners what some of the benefits

240
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,000
of this new experience are.

241
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,879
There's 3 key areas that I wanna hit.

242
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,298
First, you can now grow

243
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:43,779
faster by offering your end customers

244
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:44,320
control.

245
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,769
End customers never want to

246
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:49,178
make any trade-offs in their AWS

247
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,519
experience based on their procurement channel.

248
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,019
I think that we, we all know is true.

249
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,729
You can now leave your root access

250
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,750
to the customer. Let them retain their

251
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,950
own organizational control and

252
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,048
self-governance

253
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:05,070
while you still manage their billing and

254
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,109
deliver value-added services as a

255
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,349
reseller. It simplifies your

256
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,440
pre-sales and sales conversations,

257
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,729
and makes it easier for you to close deals.

258
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:16,928
Second, it simplifies your billing and

259
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,210
sales operations.

260
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,489
You're now receiving all of those bills

261
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:21,269
in a single

262
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:22,969
AWS account.

263
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,889
You're able to rerate to the customer

264
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,070
within AWS billing conductor.

265
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,769
And you no longer have to rely

266
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,769
on manual processes to

267
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,889
report accounts to the channel

268
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,219
programs in order to get channel

269
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:39,369
discounts applied. You can do all of that

270
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,960
to automate your FinOs workflows,

271
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,769
rebuild natively, and simplify

272
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,529
your third party tooling stack.

273
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,379
Together these should help partners scale

274
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,418
more profitably with AWS.

275
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,418
You can now simplify the workflows

276
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:57,538
and conversations with your end customers

277
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:00,090
to grow faster and reduce the

278
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,219
operational costs you have to put in in

279
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,460
order to deliver services to every

280
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,820
single customer account.

281
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,950
We wanna thank all of our launch partners

282
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,229
that helped us in this launch.

283
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,788
Um, we had an extensive beta

284
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,259
and took a lot of feedback from partners who are

285
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:19,509
experts in channel programs,

286
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:21,190
um, to get us here.

287
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,750
Um, so thank you to all of these partners

288
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,158
Software One, SHI,

289
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,229
TD CINex, Reddington, and Commit.

290
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,840
As we wrap up, let me emphasize

291
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,538
what makes billing transfer transformational.

292
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,840
For partners you can now scale more

293
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,960
efficiently and grow faster.

294
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,349
You can simplify sales

295
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,460
conversations and open new opportunities

296
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,599
that were previously closed because of the

297
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,798
channel program's root access

298
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,558
requirements.

299
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,908
Second, your customers retain their

300
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:57,269
own control. This means two things.

301
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,609
First, you're gonna have happier customers

302
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,869
that can take control of their own AWS

303
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,899
environment. And second, you're also

304
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,969
going to be able to spend less time

305
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,869
configuring settings on behalf of the

306
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,908
customer just because they don't have

307
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,229
the right management account level access

308
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:15,408
in order to set up their own

309
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,509
organizations. It'll make it easier for you to

310
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,580
onboard customers, close deals,

311
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,250
and grow those customers.

312
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,349
And AWS will continue supporting

313
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,609
mutual growth across the ecosystem

314
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,950
as we continue on into 2026.

315
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,168
We'll continue to invest

316
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,590
in these new billing capabilities to make

317
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,668
sure that there's no trade-off and

318
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,788
customers ever experience based on

319
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,288
their decision to procure

320
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:39,940
through a channel partner.

321
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,349
This truly represents the future of channel

322
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,190
partner billing

323
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,750
built on a single platform of

324
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,369
trust

325
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:48,869
and shared success.

326
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:52,928
To get started with billing transfer, you can

327
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:53,479
start today.

328
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,808
Billing transfer is officially generally available

329
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,808
as well as the new Partner Central channel

330
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:00,029
management experience.

331
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,450
You can access it through AWS

332
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,509
Partner Central.

333
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,849
AWS Partner Central is now available through the

334
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,129
AWS console as well, so you can

335
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,190
access this entire experience through the console

336
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:12,408
or in your existing AWS Partner

337
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:13,570
Central experience.

338
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:16,229
From there you can start adding customers

339
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:18,509
and initiate billing relationships

340
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:21,090
to ask your customers to transfer billing

341
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,590
to you while they retain control of their own

342
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,928
organization. Here you'll find

343
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:27,298
our technical guides,

344
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,690
um, which will help you understand how you

345
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,389
can add new customers to

346
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,070
billing transfer and how you can migrate

347
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,769
some of your existing customers who have root

348
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:37,769
access conflict

349
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,168
into billing transfers so that they're able to

350
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:40,869
take back

351
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,308
control of their organizations.

352
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
And with that I'd like to say thank you for

353
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,590
joining us,

354
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:51,070
um, and let me know if you have

355
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,830
any questions we're happy to help,

356
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,200
uh, and always we'll support you in your

357
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,269
journey either as an end customer of

358
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,250
a channel partner or a partner yourself.

359
00:12:59,629 --> 00:12:59,950
Thank you.
