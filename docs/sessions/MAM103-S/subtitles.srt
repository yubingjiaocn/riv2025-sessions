1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
(crowd applauds)

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:05,010
- So, good afternoon
everyone. My name is Ravesh.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,780
I'm with Pega Systems,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,880
and over the next 10, 15 minutes,

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,430
we're going to take you
down a little journey

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,673
of how AI is driving app modernization.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,190
So, we'll start with legacy.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,350
You know, if you've been in the
cloud modernization business

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,890
and you've been around for a while,

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,120
you'll notice that, or at least know that

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,680
85% of the workloads

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,900
have yet to move to the cloud, right?

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,630
Give or take, 80 to 85% of workloads

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,740
have not moved to the cloud.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,190
This is a statistic used by AWS.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,750
Now, if you think of why
have 85% of workloads

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,103
not yet moved to the cloud,

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,030
that's because you've got applications

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,660
that have been written
about 30, 40, 50 years ago.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,510
The complex gnarly applications

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,540
where either the developers have retired

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,600
or you've got over a
million lines of code,

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,460
you don't understand the dependencies

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,073
between the application
logic and the data.

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,530
And some of these applications
are mission critical.

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,350
They require very high
level of availability,

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,660
and there's too much risk, right?

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,510
So when we think of legacy,
legacy transformation

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,730
or legacy modernization,

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,760
that's the addressable
opportunity, that 85%, right?

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,920
And maybe it's not 85%,

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,030
but it's the top 10% within that 85%,

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,183
which are ready for disruption,

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,130
for AI-driven disruption and
have not moved to the cloud.

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,023
And if you talk to clients, you know,

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,660
this is not something that clients

37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
have just started to think about, right?

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,130
You know, there are clients

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,040
who have tried to modernize applications,

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,030
mainframe applications,
COBOL applications,

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,690
AS400 applications, and in the past,

42
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,000
these have all been very
human centric, right?

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,440
Labor driven, you know,
years, months of work

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,220
to really understand, analyze
code, reverse engineer them,

45
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,233
understand the data dependencies,

46
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,500
you know, understand
what the processes are,

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,850
understand the data,

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,040
so there's a lot of risk that
has been involved, right?

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,430
And sometimes, there are
regulatory requirements

50
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,493
that are in these applications
that we haven't understood.

51
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,660
So, what gives us the
confidence now, you know,

52
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,640
that, you know, in this world, you know,

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
where everything is AI,

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,470
what gives us the confidence
that we're now ready

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,620
to go attack these 85% of the applications

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,270
that have not moved to the cloud?

57
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,530
Now, if you just think
about what AI is doing today

58
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,030
and how AI is actually
being applied inside of IT,

59
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,540
this is a piece of work that
was done by McKinsey last year.

60
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,360
They presented this at
re:Invent last year,

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,070
and, you know, if you just
generally understand the SDLC,

62
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,793
the overall process, SDLC cycle of IT,

63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,950
there's a lot of compression
that AI is driving, right?

64
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,100
According to McKinsey,
they think it's about 50%

65
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,310
of compression in the
overall IT life cycle.

66
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,780
And if you notice over the top,

67
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,293
where the biggest compression
is happening is right here.

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,863
It's what called design
and discovery, right?

69
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,040
A lot of the AI-driven
compression is happening

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,543
within design and discovery,

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,770
because we can now, you start to use AI

72
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,860
to really help us understand requirements,

73
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,620
look at applications, reverse engineer,

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,840
reverse analyze applications,

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,300
develop the forward-engineering plans,

76
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,240
develop forward-engineering test cases,

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,380
understand and help redefine
the business processes

78
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,820
from analog processes

79
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,540
to more digitally-native
business processes,

80
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,840
and then also discover
functionality, right?

81
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,090
There's a lot of that
compression that's happening,

82
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,790
which is where AI is
being put use to, right?

83
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,270
Some of you may have, you
know, looked at AWS Transform

84
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,280
or some of the other tools.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,420
There's a lot of this tooling

86
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,556
that's happening on the analysis.

87
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:16,320
(crowd drones)

88
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,916
Now, you would think,
"Ravesh, if AWS is doing

89
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,840
AWS Transform, you know,
what is the role of Pega?

90
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,883
What is Pega trying to do here?" Right?

91
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,383
So, one of the things that
we have done, you know,

92
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,010
in the broader industry,

93
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,843
almost everybody is focused
on the analyze problem, right?

94
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,600
Analyze the legacy applications,

95
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,250
whether it's a COBOL application,

96
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,320
whether it's a Lotus Notes application,

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,090
whether it's a .NET application,

98
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,475
whether it's a Java application, right?

99
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:53,820
Most of the tools that are
there in the market today

100
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,433
are focused on analyze, right?

101
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,920
Pega is the only firm

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,620
that's actually focused
on the rewrite problem.

103
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,630
So, if you look at the overall value chain

104
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,370
from a client perspective, right,

105
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,380
if you're a large client,
an insurance client,

106
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,810
a banking client, a healthcare client,

107
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,390
and you want to modernize
these applications,

108
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,950
you've gotta focus on analyze, rewrite,

109
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,753
integrate and deploy.

110
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,080
Generally, that's sort
of the lifecycle, right?

111
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,510
So, where we fit in, where Pega fits in,

112
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,090
is we're focused on the rewrite.

113
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,680
If you can analyze it,

114
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,530
we can rewrite the application for you,

115
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,530
and our premise, our philosophy

116
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,400
is anchored around

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,350
three key dimensions of transformation.

118
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,640
One, we are in the business of
retiring legacy applications.

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,910
So, which means that we're going

120
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,790
to move from old architectures

121
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,620
to new cloud-native architectures.

122
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,890
So, that's the first degree
of of transformation.

123
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,730
The second degree of transformation

124
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,150
is we are moving from
programming languages

125
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,370
to no-code platforms.

126
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,930
Why is that important?

127
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,640
If you think about how business,

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,410
you know, business changes today, right,

129
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,700
there are continuous new
business requirements,

130
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,930
there are regulatory changes,
there are process changes,

131
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,270
there are supply chain changes,

132
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,890
so all of these changes require

133
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,320
business process change, right?

134
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,360
And you can rewrite an application

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,460
on a new programming language,

136
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,730
but six months from now,
that'll become legacy

137
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,940
because you would already
start to accumulate tech debt.

138
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,560
It's just the cycle, right?

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,873
So that is why we firmly
believe that, look,

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,200
part of our transformation
value proposition

141
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,550
is moving from application
languages to no-code platforms,

142
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,430
because then anytime there
is a business process change,

143
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,733
there's a regulatory change,
it's a configuration change.

144
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,380
It's not about requirements,
design, you know,

145
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,690
requirements, design, analysis.

146
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,190
It's a configuration change.

147
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,500
You can simulate the change using AI

148
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,350
and you can change your workflow.

149
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,480
So, that's the second
degree of transformation,

150
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,510
which is moving from application languages

151
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,130
to no-code platforms.

152
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,720
And the third degree of transformation

153
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,930
that is also happening

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,400
is you're moving from analog processes,

155
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,620
'cause a lot of processes, a lot of times

156
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,800
you have systems that are
talking to other systems,

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,010
orchestrating data,
orchestrating the flow of work

158
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,692
between your ERP system,
your fulfillment system,

159
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,780
your order management system.

160
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,540
So, you've got a lot of
orchestration that happens right?

161
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,350
Now, think about in the
modern agentic world,

162
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,700
do you really need that

163
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,070
or can agents start to
drive the orchestration

164
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,510
between different systems?

165
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,480
So, you're starting to
move from analog processes

166
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,270
where a lot of these point-to-point
connections were made

167
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,580
through all sorts of
integration technologies,

168
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,590
to where now you're using AI

169
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,220
to drive the agentic automation
across these workflows.

170
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,660
Yeah?
(crowd droning continues)

171
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,300
So, what we have done, Pega,

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,350
is we have built the tooling
to facilitate the modernization

173
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,300
of these legacy applications.

174
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,490
We call that technology Blueprint.

175
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,020
If you just look right behind you,

176
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,123
our booth is right down there, you know,

177
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,750
right where the AWS section ends here,

178
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,390
so you can actually go see our technology

179
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,700
and experience it in real time, right?

180
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,440
But what we are going to do is

181
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,090
in the next 10 minutes,

182
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,480
we're actually going to show
you the technology in action,

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,950
and if there is one thing,

184
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,120
one thing that you take away
from this little talk here,

185
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,120
it is A, B, C, anything
to Blueprint to cloud.

186
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,920
So, we're gonna show you
two examples of two app,

187
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,040
you know, one's a very
complex COBOL application

188
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,390
and one is more traditional

189
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,780
where you're doing
requirements, design, discovery,

190
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,860
and you're using those
documents, giving that to AI

191
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,830
and AI is going to build the
application for you, right?

192
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,450
So, just remember, anything
to blueprint to cloud. Yeah?

193
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,220
All right, so I'm gonna give it to Matt.

194
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,080
He's gonna walk you
through two demonstrations.

195
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,630
One, a first application
using requirements,

196
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,870
and then the second one using
AWS Transform, you know,

197
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,250
on a COBOL application.
- Cool.

198
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,083
- Yeah?
- All right.

199
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,800
Thank you, Ravesh. What's up, everybody?

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,610
Matt Healy. I lead go-to-market
for the Pega platform.

201
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,580
Just a couple minutes ago I
asked our team if I had any swag

202
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,730
I could throw out and they
handed me a bunch of pins.

203
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,900
I was like, "I can't throw pins

204
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,480
at these nice-looking people.
I'd end up on the news!"

205
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,430
So, you're welcome for that,

206
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,610
but yeah, to Ravesh's point,
let's go through a live demo

207
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,940
of what this transformation
process can actually look like.

208
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,550
So, bear with me and if
the network goes down,

209
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,620
we're all heading that way
and talking to the folks

210
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,930
who are responsible for this.

211
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,640
So, if you're not familiar with Pega,

212
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,910
it's a workflow automation
and AI-agent platform,

213
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,970
largely leveraged by large enterprises,

214
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,380
large government agencies

215
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,930
to automate their back-office processes,

216
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,880
their customer-service processes,

217
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,230
and their customer engagement.

218
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,700
Think marketing.

219
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,740
So obviously, at a large enterprise

220
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,800
who's been in business
for 50, 100, 150 years,

221
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,140
there's a lotta legacy in involved

222
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,910
in those areas of the business.

223
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,197
So, you know, we kept
getting requests like,

224
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:14,070
"Hey, what can you do
to help us, you know,

225
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,130
analyze information that we have available

226
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,550
and use that to transform
and reimagine those processes

227
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,220
into new cloud-native
applications on your platform,

228
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,890
which allow us to drive the
automation, the AI agents,

229
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,050
the experiences that
we're looking to deliver?"

230
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,000
So, that's where Blueprint comes in.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,560
So, Blueprint is available to anyone.

232
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
You can even go try this
out after the session,

233
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,600
pega.com/blueprint,

234
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,740
and essentially, it has a set
of AI agents built into here

235
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,830
that allow enterprises
to bring different types

236
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,310
of information from
their existing processes,

237
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,280
their existing legacy estates,

238
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,120
and analyze that to extract
the business processes

239
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,120
and the data models needed
to then bring it to the cloud

240
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,710
and start to reimagine it.

241
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,710
So, let's say for example,

242
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,810
I was working at a government agency

243
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,350
and we hand out grants, we take
in applications for grants,

244
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,650
and then we disperse funds after
they go through an approval

245
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,480
and a validation cycle.

246
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,010
I might have a legacy system
that looks something like this.

247
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,620
You know, maybe it was built on .NET.

248
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,740
Maybe this is Lotus Notes,
maybe this is a home-grown,

249
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,020
you know, type application.

250
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,540
Maybe this is, you know, an
off-the-shelf application,

251
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,330
whatever it may be, but
I wanna get off of it.

252
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,920
So, I might have that video

253
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,170
and I might have some
more context available

254
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,090
in the form of documentation.

255
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,110
So here, I have a requirements
document sort of describing

256
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,030
the different aspects of that process.

257
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,040
What types of data,
what types of decisions

258
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,440
do we need to make throughout the process?

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,780
So, I can take those assets directly

260
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,860
without having to, you know,
go through any analysis by hand

261
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,470
and, you know, go through
the analysis the old way,

262
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,020
and import them into Blueprint,

263
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,760
and what Blueprint is gonna do

264
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,640
is it's gonna send the
different assets out to

265
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,740
each one of those AI agents.

266
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,900
For the video processing,
it's gonna listen

267
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,570
to the transcript, if
there's a walkthrough,

268
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,370
it's also gonna look at the screens

269
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,813
and it's gonna extract,

270
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:15,101
(crowd droning continues)

271
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,581
AWS, what's up?

272
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:18,780
(Ravesh chuckles)
(crowd droning continues)

273
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,773
So, it's gonna extract, ah!

274
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,493
Darn it! That's okay.

275
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,653
Well, I will go to one that
I created just before this,

276
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,360
if I even have wifi to begin with.

277
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,320
(crowd droning continues)

278
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,270
All right, so bear with me. Sorry.

279
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,770
We knew this was gonna happen.

280
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,120
So, essentially what Blueprint does

281
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,580
is it would have analyzed those assets,

282
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,750
extracted the business processes,
extracted the data models,

283
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,140
and extracted the people
involved in the process,

284
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,700
and it's gonna take that information

285
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,090
and build me a template that
I can then begin to adapt

286
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,660
and turn into a future-state
application on the cloud.

287
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,590
So, (chuckles) you know,
from there I can invite

288
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,320
all of my business and IT stakeholders.

289
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,650
I can have many different
people engaging on this palette,

290
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,600
and almost treat this like a,

291
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,550
like a whiteboard purpose-built

292
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,160
for business-process transformation.

293
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,787
So, we can all get in here and be like,

294
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:24,090
"All right, this is
where we're coming from.

295
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,280
Now, let's make this look
like where we wanna be

296
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,130
in the future. Let's
reimagine our processes."

297
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,160
We can dive into the steps of the process,

298
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,430
and, you know, get to some
really high-level fidelity

299
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,343
of the requirements of our
future-state application.

300
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,140
We can, you know, do that
for all of our workflows.

301
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,500
We can model out our data
and our integrations,

302
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,080
so, if we need to connect
to any back-end systems,

303
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,260
we can model that out in here as well.

304
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,980
Even going as far as importing

305
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,880
application integration assets
or data assets that we have.

306
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,190
So if I have a legacy
database, I wanna migrate

307
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,010
to the cloud, I can take
SQL and import it in here,

308
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,830
it will replicate the data
structures for the cloud,

309
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,750
or if I have third-party integrations,

310
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,330
which I need to replicate
with my new system,

311
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,240
I can take a YAML file,
an open API specification

312
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,440
and integrate that in here

313
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,090
and have that replicated as well.

314
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,390
I can then move on to the people
involved with the process.

315
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,430
So, who do I need to be thinking about

316
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,090
in terms of serving experiences
and different channels?

317
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,940
And, you know, dive into each
one of their requirements

318
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,020
in terms of, you know, what
they need to be able to do,

319
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,810
what security we need to
have available for them,

320
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,540
what they need to or should
be able to see, access,

321
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,193
and edit along their journey.

322
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,330
And, you know, at the end
of this Blueprint process,

323
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,300
this is something teams
would spend, I don't know,

324
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,370
half a day, a day, working on,

325
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,380
getting their business
subject-matter experts

326
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,610
and their IT teams, you know,

327
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,410
collaborating in this environment,

328
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,170
and at the end of it,
I have a comprehensive

329
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,840
requirements document, and that's cool.

330
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,670
And this was assisted by AI,

331
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,980
and one of the things that
our AI agents did in here

332
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,280
was actually go and do some
research on best practices

333
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,690
for the use case based on

334
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,480
what it is I am looking to automate,

335
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,470
but I can even take this,
what we call a blueprint,

336
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,450
the metadata from this application,

337
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,470
and deploy it to the cloud,
whether it be on AWS, on GCP,

338
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,290
or on my, you know,
self-managed environment,

339
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,960
and generate a cloud-native
application in,

340
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,550
it takes about five minutes.

341
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,650
So, I'm able to go from
Blueprint to the cloud,

342
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,340
something I can touch,
feel, execute, test,

343
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,623
in, you know, less than a day,

344
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,480
and, you know, along the
way, I can even preview

345
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,220
before I do any of that development work,

346
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,100
before I even touch the
cloud, I can preview

347
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,050
what my application is gonna look like,

348
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,090
how my workflows are gonna come to life

349
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,080
for the various sets of users who I

350
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,260
wanna make it available to.

351
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,900
So, this is what Pega's

352
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,410
out-of-the-box back-office
portal looks like.

353
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,410
So, I can see, you know,
how a claims adjudicator,

354
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,580
what their day would look like,

355
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,440
what their experience would look like,

356
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,180
what the forms that they
would have to complete

357
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,070
would look like, you know,

358
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,823
what dashboards they'd be able
to see and take a look at.

359
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,170
I can even take a look
at a mobile application.

360
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,490
You know, maybe I have
a Salesforce application

361
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,690
that I want to plug into.

362
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,660
I can take a preview of that here as well,

363
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,220
and, you know, one of the unique things

364
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,080
about Pega's architecture,

365
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,290
that is sort of core to our philosophy

366
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,350
is that business processes, workflows,

367
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,110
should be abstracted from channels,

368
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,040
so what you're seeing here

369
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,710
is the same claims adjudication workflow

370
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,040
plugged into multiple sets of
channels for multiple users.

371
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,770
So, it allows large
enterprises to serve, you know,

372
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,740
their customers directly,
their back-office teams,

373
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,960
their customer-service representatives,

374
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,720
give them all the same
capability to create work

375
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,150
and do work, you know, without having

376
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,800
to encode the business logic

377
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,380
in each and every channel
that they wanna deliver.

378
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,150
So, it unlocks increased agility

379
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,740
and decreased total cost of ownership

380
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,070
in these multi-channel environments,

381
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,510
but I can even, you know,

382
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,790
see what it would look
like if I did wanna embed

383
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,830
that workflow directly to a customer,

384
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,090
either through like a
form-based interaction

385
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,150
or through conversational self-service.

386
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,690
And this is where we get into AI agents,

387
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,670
which are all over the place,

388
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,920
so, as you can imagine,
we couldn't get off,

389
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,110
I think it's a tally,
we have to check the box

390
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,420
that we showed AI agents
before we got off stage,

391
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,890
so I'm gonna do that.

392
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,360
So, you know, one of the things,

393
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,220
because we have this approach

394
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,310
where workflows are
separated from channels,

395
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,260
you know, one of the things
that's natural in that

396
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,110
is extending workflows to
conversational self-service.

397
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,820
You wanna give people access to,

398
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,613
you know, get work done
through natural language.

399
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,880
And we heard Matt Garmin this
morning talk about the need

400
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,243
for predictability in
our AI agents as well,

401
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,450
so that's essentially how
we're approaching this.

402
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,240
This is what we call
predictable AI agents.

403
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,580
So, you'll notice I did no prompting.

404
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,880
I didn't configure an AI agent anywhere.

405
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,850
What happens in Pega is when
you build an application,

406
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,270
we automatically wrap all
of your business processes

407
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,610
with a conversational AI agent

408
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,880
and all that AI agent can
do is act as a concierge

409
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,610
to your pre-structured processes.

410
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,440
So, let me give you an example.

411
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,030
So, if I came in here and
be like, "I broke my leg

412
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,607
and need to file a claim."

413
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,370
It's gonna go, this agent,

414
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,520
look through all of the
workflows which I defined,

415
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,970
hopefully find the right
one if AWS is cooperating,

416
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,690
and it's gonna begin to walk
me through that same process,

417
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,350
which I had up on the
Business Process Palette page,

418
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,630
and it's gonna walk me
through collecting that data

419
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,037
so I can be like, "This was today,"

420
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
you know, "500 bucks. 400
bucks. Diagnosis negative."

421
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,600
(crowd droning continues)

422
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,700
I can't type, but you get the idea.

423
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,440
And the whole time, any
interaction that I'm having-

424
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,520
With this AI agent-
- It's over 15 minutes.

425
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,550
- [Matt] Is tracked as a case,
(Ravesh speaks faintly)

426
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,050
as an instance of a workflow,

427
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,600
the same as if I submitted
it through the website,

428
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,820
the same as if a
customer-service representative

429
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,380
filled it out on my behalf,

430
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,370
so it gives me that
control, that confidence

431
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,430
in deploying AI agents at scale.

432
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,010
Let me actually take this as
well. I'm running outta time.

433
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,190
I got 15 seconds, so I did
wanna show one more thing.

434
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,420
So obviously, you know,
we're talking a lot

435
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:55,200
at re:Invent here about
getting off of the mainframe.

436
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,300
So, one of the other things
that we've done in here

437
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,300
is integrated Blueprint with
AWS Transform as an AI agent.

438
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,290
- [Ravesh] Okay.

439
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,010
- [Matt] So, I can have
a mainframe application,

440
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,660
go through the Transform process

441
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,450
to build that deep
understanding of what's in that,

442
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,420
which you see here, and then
we've built an AI agent,

443
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,460
which actually runs in Transform

444
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,090
and translates that analysis
from that mainframe system

445
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,160
into information which can actually go

446
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,320
and create that blueprint
that we were just looking at.

447
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,410
So, I can go and kick that
process off automatically

448
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,950
and then begin to go from
mainframe to something my business

449
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,570
and IT teams can collaborate on,

450
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,300
and begin to reimagine,
rethink, to the cloud,

451
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,910
and deploy that in just
a couple seconds here.

452
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,020
And we're getting the hook,

453
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,380
but, you know, we would love
if you swung over to the booth,

454
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,990
it's like 45 steps that way.

455
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,600
Come saw a demo, talked a
little bit more in depth

456
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,980
and booth 366, so don't miss it.

457
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,637
Thank you for your time.
- Yeah.

458
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:56,070
(crowd member cheers)
(crowd applauds)

459
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,720
- That mainframe application,

460
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,110
just so that, it is running Transform

461
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,470
and building the cloud-native application

462
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,583
based on the extraction, is
less than two weeks using AI.

463
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,703
So that's...

464
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:13,523
(crowd member laughs)
- Thank you.
