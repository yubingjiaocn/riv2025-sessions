00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,710
Please welcome to the stage vice president and distinguished engineer at AWS

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,219
Andy Warfield.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,109
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,770
Thanks for coming.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,050
It's really wonderful to be up here.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,489
This is,

7
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:14,029
uh,

8
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,939
this is one of the highlights of the year for me

9
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,909
because I get to stand up

10
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:18,600
and,

11
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,200
uh,

12
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,280
spend a bit of time,

13
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:20,879
uh,

14
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,290
telling you about all the things that have happened over the

15
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,350
last 12 months and putting the talk together is really fun because

16
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,059
I get to go and reflect on all the stuff we did and all the things we've learned.

17
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:30,809
Um,

18
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,530
I'm Andy.

19
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,830
I'm an engineer across our storage and our analytics teams,

20
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,599
um,

21
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:36,439
and I'm gonna,

22
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,830
I'm gonna tell you about some of the things that have happened this year.

23
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:39,490
Um,

24
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,709
so thanks for coming.

25
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,369
Um.

26
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,049
When we talk about the stuff that we build at AWS we use this term

27
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:48,549
a lot,

28
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,590
building blocks,

29
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:50,490
and,

30
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,349
um,

31
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,650
as I was starting to put things together today and

32
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,810
thinking about the work that our storage teams do,

33
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,750
I found myself thinking about building blocks a lot.

34
00:00:59,049 --> 00:00:59,490
And

35
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,389
when we say building blocks at AWS

36
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,330
we mean a fairly precise thing and it's a

37
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,430
thing that I think our engineering teams really internalize.

38
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,370
I think it's like useful to to talk about it for a sec.

39
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,550
So when we talk about building blocks.

40
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,400
The services,

41
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,129
the primitives that we build

42
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:21,230
are rarely used directly by end consumers.

43
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:22,910
They're often used

44
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:26,269
by builders who build products on top of AWS

45
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,389
and then

46
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,550
deliver their own services out to consumers.

47
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,569
And so our building blocks are polished for you as builders.

48
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:35,319
And

49
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,550
building blocks have kind of a specific shape,

50
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:38,610
right?

51
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,889
A good building block,

52
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,489
if we are getting these right.

53
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,379
Is something that you don't have to think about very much.

54
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,660
It's something that removes

55
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,239
kind of a thankless,

56
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,000
effortful bit of work

57
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
and allows you

58
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,120
to move on and work higher up the stack

59
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,360
from that level.

60
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,480
And so

61
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,360
when I work with the engineering teams across storage and data at AWS,

62
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,000
it's remarkable

63
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,760
to see how they approach things thinking

64
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:06,519
about

65
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,339
building,

66
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,440
building blocks.

67
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,059
And at the start of this talk,

68
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:10,660
this is my,

69
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,539
my 3rd year doing the storage and data talk,

70
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,139
and it's been really,

71
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:14,500
really enjoyable to go through it.

72
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,000
I,

73
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,660
I try to take a little bit of time to,

74
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,679
to talk through the lens of the engineers and the,

75
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,800
the folks that work building these building blocks.

76
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,279
And

77
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,100
building building blocks is kind of a neat thing because

78
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,289
the measure of success

79
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,880
is actually a lack of friction.

80
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,279
Right,

81
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,479
if we're doing things right,

82
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,259
you're not struggling with what we have.

83
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,940
And

84
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,500
that's really a mindset that you see

85
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,600
in the folks that build these systems.

86
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,229
They would like to be invisible,

87
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,559
right?

88
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,979
They would like you to not think about the stuff that we do.

89
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,070
And

90
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,419
if you think about what that means,

91
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,190
building those building blocks for a service like S3

92
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,860
or a lot of our other storage services,

93
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,330
S3 this year

94
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,710
is 19 years old,

95
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,250
it's almost 2 decades old.

96
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,789
And we've been working on this building block.

97
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,669
For almost 20 years.

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,619
And a lot of that kind of work

99
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,080
is,

100
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,039
it's finishing work,

101
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,029
it's sanding,

102
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,139
it's refining,

103
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,259
it's identifying those places

104
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,380
where we're still not perfect.

105
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,199
And when I talk to the engineers on the team,

106
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,820
they're so acutely aware of those imperfections,

107
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,149
and it bothers us all,

108
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,470
and we spend a lot of time working on those things.

109
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,240
Now,

110
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,160
the problems and the work that we have to do,

111
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:26,259
year on year changes every year because the scale just continues to change.

112
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,570
At this point.

113
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,440
S3 stores

114
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,789
500 trillion,

115
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,550
over 500 trillion objects

116
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,300
and serves over 200 million requests

117
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,460
per second worldwide.

118
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,779
We process over a quadrillion requests every single year.

119
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,539
It's just a phenomenal scale,

120
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:45,960
and I've been working on

121
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,389
these systems for 8 years at AWS

122
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,699
and I was blown away by the scale on the first day that I started.

123
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,679
I spent like

124
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,639
the first few months getting in the car.

125
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,929
Quietly reflecting on the size of the systems that I got to work with,

126
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,210
and it's just continued to grow over that entire time.

127
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,320
When

128
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,660
we think about that through the perspective of

129
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,520
building blocks and working at this scale,

130
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,059
there are these things that are kind of in variance in how we engineer,

131
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,669
and the teams refer to these as fundamentals,

132
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,289
security,

133
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,330
durability,

134
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,459
availability,

135
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,619
performance,

136
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,959
and elasticity.

137
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,019
If we are getting these things right.

138
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,290
You will find the tools that we build easy to use,

139
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:28,450
and all of these things are incredibly difficult

140
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,070
to build,

141
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,609
and we often have to rewrite

142
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:33,209
whole sections of our systems as we hit

143
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,329
sort of like the next levels of scale.

144
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:36,609
And so at any given point

145
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,230
we're constantly rewriting things.

146
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,209
One example is

147
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,390
in the time that I've worked on S3,

148
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:44,209
we've rewritten almost the entire data path

149
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:45,100
in Rust.

150
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:48,549
Almost all of the code that touches requests

151
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,589
from start to finish.

152
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,144
Different than it was 8 years ago when I started.

153
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:55,704
It's just continuous reinvention and improvement of the services we built.

154
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,174
And so about,

155
00:04:57,345 --> 00:05:01,005
I would say 80% of what we do falls into this category of like quiet,

156
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:02,565
innovative work.

157
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:03,135
And

158
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,575
within that 80%,

159
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,704
we do announce some stuff,

160
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:05,904
right?

161
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:06,225
In fact,

162
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,084
we announce

163
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,244
quite a lot of stuff,

164
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:08,785
but they,

165
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,445
they either

166
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:12,255
surface not at all because they're sort of scaling issues,

167
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:15,005
or they surface as small what's new posts or little updates

168
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,665
on refinements to the system.

169
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,850
Since 2020 we've had over 1000 launches.

170
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,399
It's really cool

171
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,959
to reflect at the rate of change

172
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,079
and all of the work that's been done.

173
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,600
And I have to say

174
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,140
that storage more than anything else is something that

175
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,260
has very little tolerance.

176
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,109
For not working,

177
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,989
and so the teams that build storage tend to be really,

178
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,880
really conservative,

179
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,059
and there's this tension

180
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,940
in the teams between

181
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,220
going fast

182
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,239
and being careful.

183
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:47,309
And we're always working on that sort of tension

184
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,369
and trying to deliver with velocity

185
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,339
while maintaining the level of quality that you expect from our services.

186
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,790
Now,

187
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,489
I'm gonna call out one example of the type of thing that I mean

188
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,290
with the scale of these smaller updates.

189
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,029
In August 2024,

190
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,630
so a little over a year ago,

191
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,630
we launched a conditional put

192
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,429
operation for S3.

193
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,329
So this is like kind of a,

194
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,809
a nerdy little feature,

195
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:09,239
right?

196
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,760
What conditional put does

197
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,950
is you're all familiar with the fact that you can put data into S3.

198
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,019
The conditional put adds a header on the put to S3 that says only let this put succeed

199
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,040
if the thing that I am overwriting is the thing that I expect to be overwriting.

200
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:26,149
Right,

201
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,209
and it allows me

202
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,829
to specify an invariant atput time

203
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,390
that I'm moving the system from a known state to a new known state.

204
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,899
And the reason that that's important

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,660
is if I'm building a distributed application and I've got a whole bunch of clients

206
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,019
writing data into S3 and two of them write to the same object,

207
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,500
and those puts race,

208
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,950
there's a risk that I silently lose one of those updates,

209
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,380
which depending on the semantics of my application,

210
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,119
may be quite a bad thing to have happen.

211
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,399
And so what customers tend to do

212
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,619
is without having a facility like this,

213
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,119
they have to add complexity to their systems to track

214
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,660
sort of the potentially racing puts externally

215
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,239
with

216
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,010
something that has that level of uh of consistency and tracking,

217
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,609
possibly a lock or something like that.

218
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:07,500
Now,

219
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,940
by launching conditional put.

220
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,459
We start to see it pick up,

221
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,309
and in fact,

222
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:13,329
today

223
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,070
conditional puts are actually used for about 2% of all puts to S3,

224
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,820
which may not sound like a lot,

225
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,899
but it's actually like a remarkable property to see at the scale of S3,

226
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,630
2% of foot traffic using this flag.

227
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,500
It's tens of millions of requests every minute.

228
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,470
Now the team was really excited when we launched

229
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,609
this because there was a bunch of blog coverage and

230
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,010
we're all technologists and we really love it when people

231
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,850
express excitement about the stuff that we build.

232
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,140
And so we got picked up in Architecture Weekly,

233
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,589
for example,

234
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,010
and there were a bunch of really cool

235
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,730
examples of people building

236
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,269
distributed systems constructs using just S3 conditionals,

237
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,609
doing

238
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,970
write ahead logs

239
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:50,739
and leader election and things like that.

240
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:51,989
It was just kind of cool.

241
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:56,579
The bit that I think we all found to be more rewarding than that,

242
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:57,529
the bit that was really,

243
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,750
really satisfying,

244
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,700
was that after the launch of conditional put

245
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:02,850
in customer meetings,

246
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,589
we would occasionally have someone say,

247
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,429
thank you for doing that conditional put feature.

248
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,329
It let us delete a whole bunch of code.

249
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,079
And it's so awesome when you sit down and you hear about an improvement that we made

250
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,970
at the data and storage level,

251
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:20,010
simplifying applications and being worth the effort to

252
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,640
go and tear out a bunch of complexity

253
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,299
because now we take care of that.

254
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,119
And this is the kind of improvement

255
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,579
that the teams are just relentlessly curious and focused on.

256
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,070
Here's 4 other examples out of,

257
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,989
out of the huge number of things that have happened over the

258
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,210
past year.

259
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:35,840
Um,

260
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
as you heard from Matt this morning,

261
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,619
we increased the size of the largest object that you can store in S3 to 50 terabytes.

262
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,320
Um,

263
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,119
we didn't stop at conditional put,

264
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,700
we've added conditional copy and delete operations.

265
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:47,400
Um,

266
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:51,520
we've added an atomic rename operation in S3 Express.

267
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,559
S3 Express is a.

268
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,530
Performance zonal S3

269
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:59,250
and it's used a lot for file style workloads and so having a rename operation

270
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,919
turned out to be a really valuable thing down there in terms of like

271
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,890
having sort of the ability to close out

272
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,169
transactional interactions at the file system level.

273
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,929
And

274
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,770
with S3 batch operations

275
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,700
we've added the ability to instead of specifying a manifest

276
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,950
of the objects that you want to work with,

277
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,590
you can now just specify a prefix,

278
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,109
which is a small thing.

279
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,469
But when you have a manifest of millions of

280
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,219
objects that you want to apply batch operations to,

281
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,909
it's actually like a really meaningful change.

282
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,380
Now,

283
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,700
I've talked about

284
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,760
the work that happens with scale

285
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,460
and some of these small features that the teams are just continuously focused on.

286
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:34,960
I,

287
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,659
I wanted to take an opportunity to go way down to the bottom of the stack

288
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,700
and tell you about some of the innovation

289
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,400
that we don't get to talk about as much,

290
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,710
but I absolutely love.

291
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,419
And so

292
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,880
I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the hardware and

293
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,919
software work that happens at the very bottom of our storage services.

294
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,750
So as you know,

295
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:52,599
um,

296
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:54,549
S3 is built on top of hard drives.

297
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:55,070
And,

298
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,559
uh,

299
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,450
I don't know if any of you have heard me talk before,

300
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:58,479
especially about hard drives,

301
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,450
but I can stop right now,

302
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,929
we can talk for three hours about hard drives.

303
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,840
I find hard drives really,

304
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,299
really exciting.

305
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,330
I'm gonna spare you that.

306
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:03,969
But it's,

307
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,679
it's,

308
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,109
they're engineering marvels,

309
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,260
and I love

310
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,590
talking about hard drives,

311
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,250
um.

312
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,950
We put the hard drives

313
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,270
into shelves,

314
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,229
and we put the shelves inside servers,

315
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,619
and this was how S3 was built for the 1st

316
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,960
10 plus years of its life.

317
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,400
I mean we still build in

318
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,020
effectively this form factor.

319
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,520
This model is called a JBOD and so there is

320
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,820
a server sitting underneath a sled of hard drives,

321
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,479
and

322
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,780
we drive

323
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,340
to get

324
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
more and more efficiency in our data centers year on year.

325
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:37,260
And so hard drives get larger in terms of their capacity

326
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,640
and so.

327
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:40,840
We put larger hard drives into our shelves.

328
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,309
We try and drive the density

329
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,270
of hard drives per server

330
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,210
to higher levels.

331
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:45,729
We're really,

332
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,859
really trying to optimize costs and optimize efficiency.

333
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,030
It is a remarkable thing to me as we scale out even further,

334
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,559
putting this JBOT in a rack,

335
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,650
putting that rack in a row,

336
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,530
building out into a data center,

337
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:58,450
that

338
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,390
in these

339
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,450
situations,

340
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,250
we actually have this like

341
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,520
metric that I'd never heard before working on storage at Amazon,

342
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,530
which is bytes per square foot.

343
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,049
Which is just a thing that,

344
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:10,549
like,

345
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,820
think about that later today because it's a,

346
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,080
it's a bizarre way to think about systems like a,

347
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:18,630
like a sort of aerial metric of storage capacity.

348
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,369
Um,

349
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,150
this thing of us building denser and denser JBots went on

350
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,299
for years,

351
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,049
and

352
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,429
it got to a point

353
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,770
where we actually decided to back off of it a little bit.

354
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:30,849
Dave talked about this,

355
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,289
Dave Brown in his talk last year.

356
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,309
The sort of like

357
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,960
peak JBT for us was a system design called Barge that we actually stepped back from.

358
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,830
Barge at the time was using 20 terabyte drives.

359
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:44,630
We were

360
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,229
packing as many of those things as we could into a single server,

361
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:51,890
and we were building single racks with 6 petabytes of capacity.

362
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,760
It's a lot.

363
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,020
We really liked.

364
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,419
The cost basis of barge,

365
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,289
the density,

366
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:00,700
right,

367
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,270
and the economics that it presented.

368
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,340
But as we were moving to these like densely packed servers,

369
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,030
if the server failed

370
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,119
or if we needed to move things around,

371
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,450
we were dealing with a really coarse chunk of data.

372
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:14,849
And we were starting to get to the point where

373
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,530
the server scale

374
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,609
of physical bytes in S3 was becoming unwieldy

375
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,849
for us to manage

376
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,530
and to really provide on top of.

377
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,390
And so we wanted to see if we could move to something

378
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,909
that had a bit more flexibility.

379
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,179
And as we talked about it,

380
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:33,020
we ended up pulling in folks from the EBS team,

381
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,380
from EC2,

382
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,830
talking to folks that build EC2 nitro,

383
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:41,020
and we decided to completely reinvent the storage construct that we use.

384
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,250
What we ended up building was something called metal volumes.

385
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:45,020
Uh,

386
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:46,780
this is a picture of a metal volumes rack,

387
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:47,770
and what you see

388
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,820
is the,

389
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,299
uh,

390
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,530
the teal sort of outline thing is a nitro compute node.

391
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:55,969
Its job is to securely virtualize the physical discs

392
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,900
in the shelf.

393
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,729
And the rest of what you see there is discs.

394
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,140
And so nitro manages a bunch of discs,

395
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,880
it securely virtualizes them

396
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,130
and allows us

397
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,169
to connect the physical storage fleet in S3.

398
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:07,919
To

399
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,630
our shard store host,

400
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,669
the file system that we build that maintains

401
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:14,580
our disks running on diskless EC2 instances.

402
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:16,169
And so rather now

403
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,849
than running those servers on physical servers connected to the JBods,

404
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,909
we're moving and we're able to use whatever compute we want from EC-2.

405
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,330
Now this is really neat.

406
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:25,450
It gives us

407
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,609
a greater degree of availability

408
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,809
because when those servers do fail,

409
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,000
we can simply.

410
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,299
Remap the disks to an alternate server,

411
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,950
and we can decouple the servicing task

412
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,599
of working with that initial server that needed attention.

413
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:43,309
And so we're able to move things around that way.

414
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:43,979
Similarly,

415
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:44,909
when drives fail,

416
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,190
we can map an additional drive.

417
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,049
So we're decoupling physical service

418
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,909
from like the software job of maintaining availability.

419
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,900
A second benefit

420
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,299
that came out of the design

421
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:54,859
was

422
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,059
the ability to change form factor

423
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,679
for the compute host that we were using to manage the drives.

424
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,989
And so as we realize software efficiencies,

425
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,799
we can increase the rads of drives to servers and move to smaller servers,

426
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:06,559
and vice versa.

427
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,979
If we need extra compute for some reason to perform some job or to

428
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,440
work with the data that's on the disks,

429
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,039
we can provision that up as well.

430
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,510
And so

431
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,760
the construct has really,

432
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,119
really been a cool thing.

433
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,530
Now it's not without technical challenges.

434
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,609
And one of the challenges was that we added

435
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,830
this network link between the disks and the servers.

436
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,469
And

437
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,599
like a lot of storage systems,

438
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:28,030
we write in

439
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,450
chunks of data on the disk.

440
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,169
This is especially true with zonal media like SMR.

441
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,190
And

442
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,789
not all data has the same lifetime.

443
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,130
And so as data is deleted,

444
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,609
you end up with these holes

445
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,260
in the data,

446
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,869
and what you really,

447
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:42,270
really want is large physical extents that you can write new data into.

448
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,390
And so we have to do background maintenance

449
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,030
in our system,

450
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:45,989
defragmentation,

451
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,349
right?

452
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,690
This was even a thing on

453
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,739
Windows 95,

454
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:49,830
remember.

455
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:50,500
Um,

456
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,530
and so we're continuously.

457
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,119
Rereading and scrubbing and cleaning the data on the drives to free up space.

458
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,309
Except that when we were doing this

459
00:14:59,539 --> 00:14:59,919
with

460
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,650
um

461
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,619
with metal volumes,

462
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,419
we were having to move all that data over the network.

463
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,989
And so the team worked with nitro,

464
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:07,539
and we built a facility that we called nitro offloads.

465
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,789
And what nitro offloads let us do

466
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,890
is basically extend the NVME interface and push some of these

467
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,219
low level operations to be performed by nitro at the drive.

468
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:17,270
And as a result,

469
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,090
we get about a 60% reduction in this case in

470
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,609
the amount of traffic that goes over the wire.

471
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,150
And this is one example of the kinds of innovative stuff that the team's doing

472
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,130
with this disaggregated structure of hard disks.

473
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,020
Now we're early on,

474
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,780
and this is like a super enjoyable thing and it's like

475
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,690
a good illustration of the scale that we work with.

476
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,159
We're very early on

477
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,219
in deploying.

478
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:38,650
This construct

479
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:40,849
and when we deploy anything

480
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:41,789
interesting

481
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,210
in our storage services,

482
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,080
we do it very carefully

483
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,090
and we take advantage of a erasure coating to deploy it

484
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,590
to a small subset of any given object at a time.

485
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:52,169
So we roll it out carefully

486
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,989
and very,

487
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:55,210
very methodically limit the exposure that it has,

488
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,210
and we're very early in that process.

489
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,549
And when I say early,

490
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,750
we're only 53 exabytes in

491
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,940
to deploying this thing.

492
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,559
Which is just like a

493
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:05,010
a remarkable thing to me.

494
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:05,530
Now,

495
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,469
another really cool outcome

496
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,130
of the metal volumes work was

497
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,049
we found that in right sizing

498
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,429
that virtualization compute,

499
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:13,250
the network,

500
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,669
and the flexibility of host compute at the end,

501
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:19,109
we were actually able to realize over a 10%

502
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,190
power savings end to end in our storage fleet,

503
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,309
which was a really,

504
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,309
really great result.

505
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:25,969
Um,

506
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,770
the last bit that I'm gonna talk about is I talk about kind of the,

507
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,369
the core aspects of our services is S3 Express.

508
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:31,989
Um,

509
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,760
S3 Express I already mentioned briefly,

510
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,450
but this is a,

511
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,669
a high performance

512
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,549
zonal version of S3.

513
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,210
Um,

514
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,030
I think we launched it 3 years ago

515
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,700
now,

516
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,559
and

517
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,210
Express,

518
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,950
that team just continues to innovate with Express and so

519
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,559
we've,

520
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,000
um,

521
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:49,070
gotten efficiencies in how Express is built.

522
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,210
Resulting in up to 85% price reductions for the system.

523
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:53,840
Um,

524
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,510
and that's been really,

525
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,380
really popular.

526
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,270
Um,

527
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,000
we've improved the performance of express buckets

528
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,109
up to 2 million requests per second.

529
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,919
As I mentioned,

530
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,320
we added object rename,

531
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,739
and we've also added access point support.

532
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,999
One customer who the Express team has been working with closely is Meta,

533
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:12,818
and Meta is

534
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,798
doing large scale training on top of AWS

535
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:18,038
using Express as a direct zonal backend,

536
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,678
and they're like an incredible storage workload for Express.

537
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,108
They have over 60 petabytes of storage.

538
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,038
They perform over a million transactions per second

539
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:26,938
and

540
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:29,659
are driving 140 terabits per second

541
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,629
of traffic

542
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:31,639
into Express,

543
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:32,899
and the

544
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,188
experience has been great,

545
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:35,718
and the team has loved working with them.

546
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:38,709
Now,

547
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,420
as I mentioned at the start,

548
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,819
a lot of the work that we do

549
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:43,780
is

550
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,989
that refining,

551
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,119
sanding,

552
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,180
completion work.

553
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,099
And even after 20 years

554
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,270
of working on some of our earliest building blocks,

555
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,040
we're still improving and the team still feels like we're refining them.

556
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,479
But occasionally.

557
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,260
We get to carve entirely new faces.

558
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,790
We get to build and introduce new primitives in storage.

559
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,920
Two of these primitives that we've talked about in the past year

560
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,760
are S3 tables

561
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,089
and S3 vectors.

562
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:14,599
Tables offer managed Apache iceberg tables

563
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,680
as a structured way of storing data on top of S3,

564
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,119
and S3 vectors

565
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,660
are a vector database,

566
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:24,839
a vector index API that allows you to store vectors and perform similarity search

567
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,780
within S3.

568
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,660
All of these things are built with the same sort of fundamentals that S3 has.

569
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:31,020
Now,

570
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,170
last year,

571
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,260
I was standing about.

572
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:35,660
18 minutes ago,

573
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,079
just

574
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,689
back there,

575
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,719
about to come out and announce tables,

576
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,420
and

577
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,219
I was wearing the anxiety of the entire team.

578
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:43,420
Of here

579
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,069
and it was like a really,

580
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,260
really like remarkable moment because

581
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,239
S3 is,

582
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,349
is a service that we all are so,

583
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:50,939
you know,

584
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,439
invested in and we like have a lot of pride in in the way we build it and we run it

585
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,239
and

586
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,060
we were extending its identity

587
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
in some senses,

588
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:00,670
right?

589
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,400
We were like.

590
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,040
Changing a little bit

591
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,800
what the surface was

592
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:05,719
for S3,

593
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:06,380
and

594
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,479
we were worried

595
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:08,020
that

596
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,880
while we'd talked to a lot of customers about tables

597
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,300
and we'd had the feedback on Iceberg that this was

598
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,489
like exactly what the largest Iceberg customers on S3 wanted,

599
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,760
that changing S3 from being an

600
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:19,959
object service

601
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,359
to being a more general storage service that also offered other data types

602
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,329
was a thing that

603
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:25,359
that maybe wouldn't

604
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:26,939
like land as well as we hoped it would.

605
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,260
And so I remember sitting back there and like sweating about

606
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,939
how the delivery of that slide was going to go.

607
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:32,849
And

608
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,819
in fact what happened was the response was really remarkable.

609
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,339
In fact,

610
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,109
there was sort of a tone of

611
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,489
of impatience from some folks around the fact that

612
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,020
like what took so long to get to this,

613
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,719
and people immediately.

614
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,430
Had this reaction to the launch of tables that

615
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,020
I think the team really learned a lot from,

616
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,979
which was that

617
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,560
Your definition of what it was to be a table on S3 was much closer

618
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,719
to that list of fundamentals

619
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,339
than it was to a specific API like objects.

620
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,339
And that's really where we've kind of

621
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,449
come from as we've approached building vectors,

622
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,150
which is what I'd like to talk to you about now.

623
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,439
Now

624
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,579
This is a really neat,

625
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:07,800
um,

626
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,339
sort of story.

627
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,140
Um,

628
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,660
when we launched vectors in July,

629
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,060
we launched it as a preview.

630
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:14,329
Uh,

631
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,020
it's probably been the most popular preview that we've had,

632
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:17,910
uh,

633
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,969
in our storage services.

634
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:22,790
In the 5 months that we've been operating the preview of vectors,

635
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,189
uh,

636
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:26,140
over 250,000 vector indices have been created.

637
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:26,699
Um,

638
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,339
over 40 billion vectors have been ingested into the system,

639
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,300
and we've served over a billion,

640
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:32,829
uh,

641
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,560
queries

642
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,400
in total.

643
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:35,569
And so it's really,

644
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,800
really taken a lot of,

645
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,280
um,

646
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,869
a lot of sort of action.

647
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,839
Um,

648
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:40,969
now why?

649
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:45,410
Why is a vector API in an S3 form factor interesting?

650
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:47,550
Why would the S3 team think about

651
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,569
building a

652
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,609
vector database?

653
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,880
What's the story here?

654
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,920
I think a useful way to think about the value and the,

655
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:56,780
the sort of like interest that we're seeing with vectors is that

656
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,229
the way that we work is changing,

657
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,599
and I,

658
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,219
I,

659
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,300
I hope this like kind of resonates with folks.

660
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,760
Um,

661
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,479
I'm a,

662
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,359
a huge music enthusiast.

663
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:04,989
Um,

664
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,959
I'm planning a summer barbecue.

665
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,150
I had to come up with like a little bit of a contrived example for this,

666
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,359
so you're gonna have to bear with me.

667
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,180
I've got a CD collection

668
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,280
and

669
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,579
I am building an index of my CDs in,

670
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,369
um,

671
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,939
parquet in a table.

672
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm gonna write some code for this thing.

673
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,689
And so I sit down.

674
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,489
And I'm going to write this code,

675
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,439
and if we imagine what it was like to write this code,

676
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:26,930
right,

677
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,390
to go and scan this list and pick the

678
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,869
songs to play and maybe even play the songs,

679
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:32,449
um,

680
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,209
even 2 or 3 years ago,

681
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,890
you know what this experience is like,

682
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:36,089
right?

683
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,489
I sit down and I write the code.

684
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,250
I write the software that tells the computer how to do exactly what I want.

685
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,010
And

686
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,910
I tell it

687
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,609
exactly what data it should use.

688
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,239
And

689
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,859
I'm sure we've all had the experience,

690
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,329
especially over the last year,

691
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,479
moving into

692
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,530
these more agentic-driven workflows and using Gener AI for development,

693
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:57,380
that

694
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,680
the way that we interact

695
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,859
is changing and is upleveled a little bit.

696
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,650
I asked for a much more ambiguous thing,

697
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:02,989
right?

698
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,160
I asked to build

699
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,369
the mix of 80s songs for my summer barbecue,

700
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,869
and

701
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,449
as we're all familiar with,

702
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,400
this is going to go through some kind of like

703
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,239
chain of thought

704
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,400
reasoning process,

705
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,180
and it's going to produce the code.

706
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:15,319
And at this point.

707
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,020
Producing that code

708
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,520
is a reasonably unsurprising result.

709
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,000
Right,

710
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,119
at first it was shocking,

711
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,949
and now it's just like,

712
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,199
wow,

713
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:23,510
it's like there's the code.

714
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,459
The bit that is really interesting here from a storage perspective

715
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,989
is not that part.

716
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,140
It's this part.

717
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,660
It's that the agent

718
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,239
hopefully sees an awful lot of my data.

719
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,770
And the agent needs to decide that to answer that question,

720
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,689
it's gonna have to go and use

721
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:41,810
that table

722
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,689
of metadata for my CDs and the bucket of music that I have.

723
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:46,489
And

724
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,449
it's worth reflecting on the fact

725
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,189
that this thing that I did as a developer of

726
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:53,209
like knowing that I had those two data sources,

727
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,849
of plumbing them into the software

728
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,619
is a thing that I really take for granted that

729
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,810
like my brain's pretty good at and

730
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:02,630
most data structures and algorithms in computer science

731
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,270
actually have a pretty hard time with.

732
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,170
And this idea of finding the right data without pre-indexing,

733
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,670
without knowing exactly what has to be done,

734
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,280
is where vectors step in,

735
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:11,689
right?

736
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,219
That

737
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,869
ambiguous problem

738
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,810
of choosing the right data to answer this question.

739
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,479
And so when I go back to my CD collection,

740
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:22,260
I've given it this metadata.

741
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:24,000
I've given it the columnar structure

742
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:24,939
of artists,

743
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:25,339
track,

744
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,859
albums,

745
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,500
release dates,

746
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,209
things like that.

747
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,000
But there are so many other things

748
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,439
that are properties of this music

749
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,780
that are important in thinking about it.

750
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:38,239
There's like the tonality of the music or whether it's upbeat

751
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,390
or whether it was in a commercial or things like that,

752
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:40,900
and.

753
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,290
I can't

754
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,719
conceivably go through and label all of these things upfront.

755
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:48,430
These are just semantic concepts about the data.

756
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,109
And so this

757
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:53,319
is the thing that's really changed and been remarkable recently,

758
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,989
that

759
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,119
I can take these things.

760
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,150
I can turn them,

761
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,000
the media,

762
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,829
into a vector representation,

763
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,880
which is really just

764
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,500
a list of floating point numbers.

765
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,219
And I can embed that vector in a space.

766
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,800
This is a 3 dimensional space.

767
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,569
When you ask a graphic designer,

768
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:11,199
even a very,

769
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,430
very excellent graphic designer to draw you a 1500 dimensional space,

770
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,109
they get really upset at you.

771
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,930
And so we decided to stick with 3 for the talk.

772
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,390
The concepts that you see called out

773
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:23,869
kind of map to

774
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,989
clusters inside

775
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,000
the vector space,

776
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,609
neighborhoods.

777
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:29,219
And now what I do is I use an embedding model,

778
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,189
the same embedding model that I used to place

779
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,540
those vectors in there in the first place.

780
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:33,439
I take my query,

781
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,199
I generate a vector

782
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,699
that is a point inside the space.

783
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,540
I do an approximate nearest neighbor search,

784
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,239
and I find the results that are similar to that thing.

785
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,300
And this is how a similarity search works.

786
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,680
It's the basis for retrieval augmented generation.

787
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,540
It's also used in a bunch of other emerging fields

788
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,020
outside of AI like identifying interesting images in radiology.

789
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:54,989
Doing fraud detection

790
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,170
and all sorts of other really interesting things.

791
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,910
Vectors are very much emergent as a neat sort of tool.

792
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:01,729
Now,

793
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,680
A tricky thing and part of what really drove the

794
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,829
S3 team with the work that they did on vectors

795
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,869
was as we looked at the size of vectors relative to the size of data,

796
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,410
we found that there were kind of some interesting properties.

797
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,369
If you were working with photos or video,

798
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,859
and

799
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,790
these are really hand wavy kind of numbers that I'm using here,

800
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,560
there's all sorts of assumptions that you can kind of cook.

801
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:21,994
To how you build your vectors,

802
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:23,084
but ballpark,

803
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:23,974
0.1%,

804
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,734
the size of the data is the size of the vectors that you have to store.

805
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:29,555
Vector databases typically have to be in DRAM or SSD,

806
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:30,935
and I'll come back to that in a sec.

807
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:33,494
When you start generating vectors on text,

808
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:37,035
you find that text is a very dense source of information

809
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,824
relative to its storage size.

810
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:42,074
And so you often find that vector indices for text

811
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,875
are actually larger to the tune of 2 or 3x the size

812
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,375
of the text that you're storing.

813
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,020
And since that vector index has to be stored in more expensive storage,

814
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,839
it's quite an explosion

815
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,300
over that type of data.

816
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,819
And this text data that people are indexing

817
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,540
is everything from PDF documents

818
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,339
to

819
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,839
call transcripts from call centers to code to things like that.

820
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,270
And so it's a really meaningful thing.

821
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,260
And this was a reason not to use vectors.

822
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,849
And so a lot of what drove us into the work with vectors in S3

823
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,790
was wanting to get to an S3 cost structure for vectors

824
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:20,770
that made this very useful indexing structure available to any data

825
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:22,560
that anyone wants to bring it to,

826
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:23,550
at any scale.

827
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:27,189
Now today we're launching vectors.

828
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:28,609
Matt talked about it this morning.

829
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:33,910
The 5 months of preview was incredibly helpful for the product and the team.

830
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:35,290
We worked so closely

831
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,670
with the customers who adopted vectors on day one.

832
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,380
We work to improve the latency of queries down to a design of 100 milliseconds,

833
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,790
um,

834
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,119
which is a big improvement over where we launched.

835
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,439
That was one big bit of feedback.

836
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,780
We've increased the maximum index size

837
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,060
to store up to 2 billion vectors

838
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,050
with 10,000 indices per bucket,

839
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,280
and you could upload at a rate of 1000 vectors per second.

840
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,670
Um,

841
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:02,180
now,

842
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,540
I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about vectors,

843
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,640
but I thought it would be good to take a second

844
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,359
and let you hear about,

845
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,089
um,

846
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:11,939
the experience of using our storage services from a customer.

847
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:12,880
And

848
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,479
so I'm just gonna show you a little clip here.

849
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,140
Please help me welcome Cedric Fernandez,

850
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:32,589
um,

851
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,250
the VP of engineering at GoPro,

852
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:34,709
um,

853
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,280
to the stage.

854
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:40,839
Thank you,

855
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,239
Andy,

856
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:41,979
there you go.

857
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,910
I love that video,

858
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,479
um,

859
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:51,089
just the pure joy on their faces coming down the waterslide,

860
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:51,449
etc.

861
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,520
is just so uplifting.

862
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,170
Love it.

863
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:54,910
Good afternoon everybody.

864
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,479
If I were to ask you about GoPro's line

865
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,619
of business,

866
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,979
You are more than likely to say,

867
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,260
you guys are a consumer electronics company,

868
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,920
you make action cameras.

869
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,400
And

870
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,349
you'd be right,

871
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,260
we've sold

872
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,079
50 million plus of these devices till date

873
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,800
globally.

874
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,280
But we're so much more than that.

875
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:16,579
Our mission

876
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,560
is to help people

877
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,640
live and experience life's moments

878
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,880
and then share that with their friends and family.

879
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,060
And so in order to achieve that mission,

880
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,099
we've got to deliver on a GoPro experience that goes well beyond capture.

881
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,390
That helps you offload that content,

882
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,670
helps you manage that content,

883
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,949
helps you discover that content effectively.

884
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,709
Tell beautiful stories in an immersive and evocative way.

885
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,420
And share that

886
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,579
with your friends and family.

887
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:43,949
And in order to do that,

888
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
since 2015,

889
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,380
we've been working on this platform.

890
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,209
It's cloud-backed,

891
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,160
runs across multiple devices,

892
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:50,569
etc.

893
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,449
but it helps you do this in a painless and seamless way.

894
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,910
That's the GoPro experience we want for our customers.

895
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,349
Now,

896
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:00,369
if I were to ask you similarly,

897
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,310
What do you believe people capture with their GoPro cameras?

898
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,560
You're more than likely to say

899
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,599
action sports because that's what we're known for.

900
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,709
But interestingly,

901
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:15,229
people also use these devices to capture all sorts of content beyond action sports.

902
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:16,689
Whether it's

903
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,209
a backyard birthday party,

904
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:19,619
religious ceremony,

905
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:20,689
bar mitzvah,

906
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:21,540
recently,

907
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,310
in my own case,

908
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:22,810
my

909
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,170
daughter just graduated from high school,

910
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,150
capturing her graduation party.

911
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:28,670
So

912
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,569
we have a lot of diverse content

913
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,150
in our systems.

914
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,160
It's not just divorce,

915
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:36,400
it's actually also long form.

916
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:38,420
You all use your cellphones,

917
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:39,270
mirrorless cameras,

918
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:39,619
etc.

919
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:40,599
to capture content

920
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:42,719
and your life's moments these days.

921
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,569
The GoPro experience is very different.

922
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,760
What we found is

923
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,930
people follow what we call this fire and forget model,

924
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,260
right?

925
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,310
You go out,

926
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:51,560
you turn on your camera.

927
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,020
You let it run,

928
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,780
you live your life,

929
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:54,479
and then

930
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:55,290
You know,

931
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,170
hopefully you've got some beautiful moments that you can

932
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,369
then share with the rest of the world.

933
00:29:58,489 --> 00:29:58,829
So

934
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,920
in that scenario,

935
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,180
unlike your cell phones,

936
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,319
where you're actually framing the shot,

937
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,670
you're composing the shot,

938
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:06,349
you let your shutter go,

939
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:07,369
it's very different.

940
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:10,430
So we end up with all of this tremendous long form

941
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,329
content in our systems as well.

942
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,640
Take for example

943
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,500
A surfing session,

944
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:17,089
right?

945
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:17,640
So

946
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,400
you go out,

947
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,630
you've turned your camera on,

948
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,390
you're paddling,

949
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,670
you're waiting for a wave,

950
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:22,439
if you're lucky,

951
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,719
you catch a really good wave.

952
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,079
Maybe 1015 minutes out there,

953
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,310
you're capturing content,

954
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:29,189
what you really need

955
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:32,849
is those 5 seconds or the 7 seconds of you riding that wave.

956
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:33,800
Right,

957
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,400
so

958
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,219
That can be a very painful experience.

959
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,000
I've gone through this.

960
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,739
I'm sure

961
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,119
many of you have as well,

962
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:43,739
where you've got to go through reams and reams of video to just go try and find.

963
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,689
Those special moments

964
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,380
And that's the experience

965
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,719
we want to solve for

966
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,489
at GoPro.

967
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:51,140
So,

968
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,660
why is all of this relevant to a conversation on

969
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,869
S3 and,

970
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,920
and S3 vectors?

971
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,630
Well,

972
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,349
we have a lot of content.

973
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,219
450 + petabytes of media today sitting in S3.

974
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,410
a billion plus media assets,

975
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,060
we're growing at about a million assets or so per day.

976
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:11,560
Now,

977
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,640
as an aside,

978
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:17,030
we've been able to scale out the way we have over these years because

979
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,339
S3 interestingly also follows this fire and

980
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,290
forget model that we experienced with GoPro.

981
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,170
We don't have to worry about SSDs.

982
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:26,689
Andy was talking about that earlier.

983
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,849
I am so thankful that's his problem and not mine.

984
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,630
Uh,

985
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:31,760
um,

986
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,390
but yeah,

987
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,489
we've been able to scale out,

988
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:33,699
I mean,

989
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,119
honestly,

990
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,430
without even blinking

991
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,290
an eyelid.

992
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,410
Uh,

993
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,609
so it's super helpful for us.

994
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,199
Now,

995
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:40,130
our challenge,

996
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,900
given that we've got all of this content,

997
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:42,439
like I said,

998
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:42,790
is

999
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,550
how do we make sense.

1000
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,300
Of all this immense content.

1001
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,189
In a cost-effective and scalable way

1002
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:52,069
for our customers.

1003
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,130
That's the challenge,

1004
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,140
that's what we need to solve for at GoPro.

1005
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:55,670
Now,

1006
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,150
in the past,

1007
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,510
we've

1008
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,469
done this

1009
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,050
through numerous mechanisms,

1010
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:02,910
computer vision models.

1011
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,569
Machine learning algorithms,

1012
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,880
we have a number of sensors on our camera that's collecting a lot

1013
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,599
of information that we can leverage to identify certain key moments in,

1014
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,449
in videos.

1015
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,020
We've used those things

1016
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,619
and.

1017
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:18,829
These are all very complicated pipelines.

1018
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,500
They kind of do the job,

1019
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,420
but they're very complicated pipelines,

1020
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,390
and they're missing a very key component for good storytelling.

1021
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,729
Now,

1022
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,439
you all know,

1023
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,430
those of you who

1024
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,069
capture video and want to tell stories.

1025
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,489
Everybody tells stories differently.

1026
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,229
The way I tell a story of a particular moment in my life might be different from

1027
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,949
how one of you tells a story,

1028
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,369
even if it's a very similar moment.

1029
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:45,750
And in order to achieve that level,

1030
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,989
Of experience,

1031
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,790
context is super important,

1032
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,229
and the key ingredient we've missed

1033
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:55,670
for a number of years while we've tried to achieve our mission.

1034
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,729
It was really hard to bring context to that experience.

1035
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:00,640
Well,

1036
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,599
fast forward to today,

1037
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,800
that's the promise of AI,

1038
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:03,439
right?

1039
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,000
Um,

1040
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,339
LLMs.

1041
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,050
Agent Core from memory,

1042
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,089
vectors,

1043
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,979
it's all about vectors,

1044
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,439
baby.

1045
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,939
These days it's all about vectors.

1046
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:16,060
All of these things put together allow us to achieve that.

1047
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,800
So we're really excited

1048
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,420
about what these technologies can do for us and,

1049
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,760
and for our customers,

1050
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:25,280
and we're really looking forward to going and making this happen in the future.

1051
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,420
Interestingly,

1052
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:27,219
it's a mouthful.

1053
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,670
You look at LLMs,

1054
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:29,979
vectors,

1055
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,459
multimodal embeddings.

1056
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,410
But when I look at the architectures

1057
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,670
we're deploying today with these capabilities,

1058
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:38,650
They're much more simplified than the architectures

1059
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,189
we've actually employed in the past.

1060
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,170
So,

1061
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,910
lots of opportunity here and very excited

1062
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,550
about doing this going forward.

1063
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:46,670
Thank you.

1064
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,319
Andy,

1065
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:47,900
back to you.

1066
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,089
It's so cool to see that,

1067
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:00,430
um.

1068
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:01,500
I've,

1069
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:01,900
uh,

1070
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,900
I have 3 kids that

1071
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:06,250
ski with GoPro cameras and I'm very familiar with

1072
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,879
scrolling through GoPro

1073
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,478
film to find the

1074
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,290
air

1075
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,850
in them and so

1076
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,760
this

1077
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,850
democratization

1078
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:18,489
of um data structures that let us go and search

1079
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:20,629
in really complex media like video

1080
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,530
I think is,

1081
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,219
is like a really,

1082
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,668
really interesting thing and I think that we're gonna see a lot more out of it,

1083
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:26,409
um,

1084
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,250
as I sort of hinted at before.

1085
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,909
This is not just an

1086
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,188
AIML thing.

1087
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:31,989
Um,

1088
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,790
the,

1089
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,290
the use of,

1090
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:34,958
um,

1091
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:38,168
similarity search in these like high dimensional spaces

1092
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,120
is something that we are seeing,

1093
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:40,580
um,

1094
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:40,989
customers,

1095
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,370
especially in healthcare and sciences,

1096
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,340
um,

1097
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,969
using to do like structural search on molecules,

1098
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:47,350
uh,

1099
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:47,949
as I mentioned,

1100
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,489
looking for differences with radiology images.

1101
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:52,429
It's something that feels very young.

1102
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:56,059
In terms of the computer science that's behind it and it's something that

1103
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:56,998
I think is like

1104
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:57,878
super exciting

1105
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,029
to see that that both the algorithms and the applications moving forward so quickly

1106
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:02,368
and I,

1107
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:04,958
I think that we're probably gonna be talking a lot more about

1108
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,519
the kinds of innovative stuff that you are doing

1109
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:09,239
with vectors in the coming years.

1110
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:11,398
Now I wanted to tell you a little bit about

1111
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,499
the implementation and how we do this in S3 because it's kind of cool,

1112
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:15,059
um.

1113
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,610
As I told you,

1114
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,500
a vector database is usually an in-memory construct,

1115
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,739
and it's because

1116
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:22,850
to index these high dimensional spaces,

1117
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,820
you typically build a graph,

1118
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:25,060
right,

1119
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,590
you typically take these vectors and you add metadata in the structure.

1120
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,699
If you can imagine using a tree to search lower dimensional data,

1121
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:33,760
you build a graph that points to other

1122
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,080
vectors that are sort of nearby in terms of a distance metric.

1123
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,479
And as a result,

1124
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,399
finding nearby vectors

1125
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,179
means hopping back and forth to memory a whole bunch.

1126
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:47,590
Now that works great when your data's in memory or on fast SSD.

1127
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:51,889
It does not work nearly as well when your data is entirely in S3

1128
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,689
and you have higher hard drive style latencies to access that data.

1129
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,659
Your vector searches end up taking like many seconds or

1130
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,810
even minutes because of all the round trips to storage.

1131
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,090
And so to drive

1132
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:03,610
the cost structure

1133
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:06,510
down and to get the elasticity that we wanted,

1134
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,969
we had to approach the design of vectors

1135
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:10,709
as a sort of S3 problem.

1136
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,179
And what we ended up doing was observing that a lot of the

1137
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,120
vector data structures

1138
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,479
use a clustering

1139
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,129
or a a sort of neighborhood style top level encapsulation of the vectors,

1140
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:23,300
right?

1141
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:24,239
They group them

1142
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:27,300
into nearby groups and vectors may exist in one or more of these.

1143
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,850
And when you do a query,

1144
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,489
you go find the relevant neighborhoods and then you search inside it.

1145
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,520
And so

1146
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,600
rather than

1147
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,260
using S3 as a latency sensitive store,

1148
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:38,419
we shifted to use it the way that it works really well,

1149
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,699
which is a widely parallel throughput sensitive store.

1150
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,520
We took these neighborhoods.

1151
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:47,040
We encoded the neighborhoods as objects,

1152
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:49,949
and when you do a query to S3 vectors,

1153
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,219
the query will actually promote a number of those neighborhoods

1154
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,780
into faster memory for the duration of your query.

1155
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,209
It'll search locally and in parallel across those objects,

1156
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:02,179
and it'll leave that data resident long enough

1157
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:05,719
for you to handle any subsequent queries that come by in the next little while,

1158
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,580
and then eventually

1159
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,399
it'll go back to using the storage basis of vectors.

1160
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,310
And so the system is kind of a co-design

1161
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,229
between a traditional vector database

1162
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,120
and a really,

1163
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,199
really throughput optimized backend.

1164
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:17,780
Um,

1165
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,000
we borrowed ideas from some of the implementation under S3 tables.

1166
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,610
It's structured as a log structured merge tree underneath.

1167
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:27,239
We do a lot of aggregation of data in the background and continuous indexing.

1168
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:28,610
And so the system's really cool.

1169
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,419
Um

1170
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:36,290
Another example in addition to what we heard from Cedric about GoPro's use

1171
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,270
is BMW,

1172
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:37,739
and there's,

1173
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:38,780
there's a pile of,

1174
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,209
I had trouble choosing

1175
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,260
the sort of other customer story to tell you about with vectors,

1176
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,610
but

1177
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,709
BMW

1178
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:46,250
has built

1179
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,520
a vector integrated data lake for understanding their own product quality.

1180
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:52,840
And this is a really cool system

1181
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,500
in that

1182
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:54,840
the BMW

1183
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:55,679
team

1184
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,000
doing analysis against their data

1185
00:37:58,139 --> 00:37:59,800
is doing natural language search,

1186
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,409
and so they've built a natural language

1187
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:04,189
search interface that sits above both Athena

1188
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,959
for querying structured data

1189
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,280
and S3 vectors

1190
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,370
for querying less structured data,

1191
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,959
and then fuses those things together and is able to let the analyst team

1192
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,060
quickly work through enormous amounts of performance and historical data.

1193
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:21,840
OK,

1194
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:23,820
So now,

1195
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,520
we'll go back to last year's launch of Tables

1196
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,610
and talk about what's happened on that since then.

1197
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:29,320
Um,

1198
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,939
Tables was also

1199
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:31,600
a really,

1200
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,250
really,

1201
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:32,989
um,

1202
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,340
wonderfully popular,

1203
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,020
uh,

1204
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,399
launch.

1205
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,600
We were really happy with the feedback that we got on it.

1206
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,580
At this point,

1207
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,459
there are over 400,000 S3 tables,

1208
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,100
um,

1209
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,860
being hosted on the system.

1210
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,719
Um.

1211
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,320
An example customer for SV tables is Indeed,

1212
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:48,879
uh,

1213
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,500
who already had a large iceberg-based data lake.

1214
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:52,780
Um,

1215
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:53,899
uh,

1216
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,899
Indeed helps people find jobs,

1217
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,739
and,

1218
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,310
um,

1219
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,709
in order to do that,

1220
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,620
needs data to be very,

1221
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,600
very recent,

1222
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:02,100
um,

1223
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,060
and up to date.

1224
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:03,939
And so

1225
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,780
every day they ingest over

1226
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,600
0.5 petabyte of update data into the system.

1227
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,479
They maintain an 85 petabyte data lake,

1228
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,000
um,

1229
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,439
and are continuously serving queries,

1230
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:14,820
uh,

1231
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,340
to help their customers.

1232
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,810
Uh,

1233
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:20,409
Indeed is in the middle of a big migration into SV tables

1234
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,300
and is,

1235
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,840
um,

1236
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:22,409
is,

1237
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:26,229
is being driven to do it largely because of both the performance acceleration

1238
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,330
and the reduced both cost and operational effort of running on top of tables.

1239
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:31,989
Now

1240
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:34,219
I need to

1241
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,520
rewind back.

1242
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,979
I guess I'm using CDs,

1243
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,199
maybe I can't say rewind,

1244
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:38,489
uh,

1245
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,350
skip back a few tracks

1246
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,260
and go back to my example of um of my CD collection.

1247
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,810
So this is not a bad example of uh tables-based database,

1248
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:48,520
right?

1249
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,179
Like when we're talking about tables in Iceberg,

1250
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,199
we're talking about structured columnar data.

1251
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:53,060
Um,

1252
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:56,520
and for years and years and years people have been hosting these types of data lakes

1253
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:57,580
on top of S3.

1254
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:59,820
MapReduce jobs ran against Parquet and S3.

1255
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:02,879
The thing that has kind of changed over the past

1256
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,979
bunch of years and what led us to build tables

1257
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:05,909
was that

1258
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,679
the more powerful the analytics frameworks became running on top of this data,

1259
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,879
the more people wanted this data to be mutable and act like a database back end.

1260
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,830
And that meant being able to do inserts of new data,

1261
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:17,350
for instance,

1262
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:18,739
adding rows to the table,

1263
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,100
doing upserts,

1264
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:21,030
deletions,

1265
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,550
all the changes that you'd expect to be able to do

1266
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,030
by your table store at the back end of your database.

1267
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:26,889
Now,

1268
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,929
when we look at what's happening

1269
00:40:29,149 --> 00:40:32,149
in Iceberg under the covers of that workload,

1270
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,530
it's important to realize

1271
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,070
what it takes to build a construct like that on top of S3.

1272
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:38,850
Remember S3 is immutable,

1273
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,679
and so

1274
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,560
this mutable construct that's built on top of S3

1275
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,840
is effectively a file system

1276
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:46,969
being built on top of the object store.

1277
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,209
And so my catalog is a bunch of layers of metadata,

1278
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,679
pointing ultimately to data stored in parquet.

1279
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,679
And as I make changes

1280
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,560
to my table,

1281
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
those changes,

1282
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,989
And I've kind of simplified this

1283
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,370
diagram a whole bunch,

1284
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,409
but those changes are gonna result in new metadata files being written,

1285
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,209
pointing to both the new parquet files and the old data inside the table.

1286
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,229
And as that

1287
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,139
proceeds,

1288
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:11,939
um,

1289
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,810
I will accumulate more metadata,

1290
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,239
snapshots of the database,

1291
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,459
and more parquet files.

1292
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,340
And so

1293
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,949
when we were first sitting down to design tables for S3,

1294
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,540
we talked to

1295
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,719
founders Iceberg,

1296
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,020
the folks at Netflix

1297
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
that that were very passionate about that work.

1298
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,979
They shaped our design enormously.

1299
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,560
We worked with some of the largest Iceberg customers

1300
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,600
that were using Iceberg in production at the time,

1301
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,979
and the thing that we heard

1302
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,000
from a lot of those.

1303
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:36,939
Customers

1304
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:37,760
was

1305
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,899
they loved the flexibility,

1306
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:40,770
the expressiveness,

1307
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,939
and the mutability that they could get on top of their tables.

1308
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,459
They did not love running background tasks and the

1309
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,620
maintenance that was involved in doing garbage collection,

1310
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:50,780
cleaning up these small parquet files into larger parquet files,

1311
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,729
which is required to maintain performance.

1312
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:53,560
And so

1313
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,399
customers were asking us.

1314
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:00,139
To make tables behave more like they were used to S3

1315
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:02,939
behaving in terms of being a first-class storage system for tables.

1316
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,060
As I said,

1317
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:08,699
the expectation at launch was even ahead of what we'd managed to deliver at the time,

1318
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,120
and the team has been trying to fill the shoes

1319
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:12,850
that you set out for us,

1320
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:14,719
or maybe that we set out for ourselves

1321
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,459
at launch,

1322
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,639
and the number of launches through this year has been absolutely incredible.

1323
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:22,270
One launch I think the team was really proud of,

1324
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,879
that was earlier in the year,

1325
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,639
was

1326
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,340
we were able to achieve a 90%

1327
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,219
compaction price reduction for maintaining those tables.

1328
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:31,739
And so when we first

1329
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:32,800
built tables,

1330
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,429
we were running compaction

1331
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,219
with our own

1332
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:38,840
isolated full scale spark clusters,

1333
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,479
and the team has worked ruthlessly to just continuously optimize this.

1334
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,340
We moved

1335
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,260
our compaction to run on top of

1336
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,389
a lighterweight BM container

1337
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,139
in the form of a firecracker,

1338
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,659
and we've

1339
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,340
continuously worked to optimize

1340
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:57,679
and basically own that compaction code to make it as efficient as we can.

1341
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,179
So that's been one improvement.

1342
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:03,280
There are a few new improvements this week that I'm really happy to share.

1343
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,080
One of them

1344
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,699
is cross-reg replication.

1345
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:06,899
Um,

1346
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:08,350
with cross-region replication,

1347
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,550
customers have asked to be able to replicate their tables across regions.

1348
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:12,370
Pretty simple thing

1349
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,489
conceptually,

1350
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:13,790
um,

1351
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,810
it's something that everyone's accustomed to doing

1352
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:17,600
with objects in S3.

1353
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:18,330
Now.

1354
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,489
This is something where,

1355
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,620
and we find this with a lot of stuff with tables,

1356
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,530
the feature is easy to explain,

1357
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,989
but subtle and a little bit complex when you

1358
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:28,689
think about these data structures under the cover.

1359
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:29,979
And

1360
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:30,899
the reason

1361
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:32,939
that replicating

1362
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,739
snapshots or views of your table across regions is tricky,

1363
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,580
is that when we replicate

1364
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,860
objects,

1365
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:40,790
um,

1366
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:41,820
we

1367
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,899
kind of have the freedom to do it in any order.

1368
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:44,679
Right,

1369
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,000
we,

1370
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,399
we replicate objects with RTC we provide

1371
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,110
a guarantee of how quickly we'll replicate,

1372
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,780
but as the objects arrive,

1373
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,500
we move them in the background as a massive batch operation.

1374
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,439
With tables,

1375
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:56,360
if you do that,

1376
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:57,510
you can cause trouble,

1377
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,280
because the table internally has data dependencies down that snapshot.

1378
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:03,899
And if I replicate that top level of metadata,

1379
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,959
and I don't replicate the metadata nodes that it points to,

1380
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,540
my query will actually fail

1381
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,320
because the engine that I'm using,

1382
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:12,030
Spark or Pi Spark or whatever,

1383
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,360
can't find the files or the objects that other objects point to.

1384
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:16,889
And so the team

1385
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:18,080
had to innovate

1386
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,290
to clean this up.

1387
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:20,219
And

1388
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:21,449
we built something

1389
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,229
that I'm gonna refer to as DLWKC consistency.

1390
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,070
Um,

1391
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:27,709
this is not a super technical term.

1392
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,689
It stands for

1393
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,929
don't leave without the kids in the car,

1394
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,050
consistency.

1395
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:33,260
And

1396
00:44:33,459 --> 00:44:34,840
what this really is doing is,

1397
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:36,080
is pretty much what you'd imagine,

1398
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:36,360
right?

1399
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:36,600
We,

1400
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:37,699
we wait

1401
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,540
with publishing that top level node

1402
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:42,820
until we know that everything is there.

1403
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,020
Until we know that everything that sits below it is there,

1404
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:48,120
and then we make the top level of the snapshot visible,

1405
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,219
and now your snapshots atomically show up

1406
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,820
as groups on the remote end and you can

1407
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,790
trust your workloads to run against them.

1408
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,600
And so,

1409
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,080
you know,

1410
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:57,959
everybody's happy.

1411
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,310
Um,

1412
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:03,139
a second aspect of what we've done is intelligent hearing.

1413
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:03,659
Um,

1414
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,620
intelligenteering launched 8 years ago for S3.

1415
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,199
Um,

1416
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,610
I'm sure you're familiar with S3 storage classes.

1417
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:10,479
Um,

1418
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,399
when we launched intelligent hearing,

1419
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,800
we had heard the customers loved the gradiation of

1420
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,330
storage classes that we have for data in S3,

1421
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:17,800
um,

1422
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,510
but

1423
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,439
it's a bit of work to manage which objects should live in which one.

1424
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:24,429
And so intelligent cheering

1425
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:26,489
tracks the behavior of your objects,

1426
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,000
and as your objects remain cold for over 30 days,

1427
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,629
we will move them,

1428
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:31,439
um,

1429
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:33,070
into an encoding that's more efficient

1430
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,570
and allow you to get a cost savings,

1431
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,090
and similarly at 90 days.

1432
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:36,850
And,

1433
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,419
If you go and access the objects,

1434
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,260
they're promoted back up to

1435
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,209
standard,

1436
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,699
effectively.

1437
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:44,409
When you run

1438
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,590
um these OTFs like Iceberg,

1439
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:48,610
those background tasks

1440
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,790
act as a bit of interference for that.

1441
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,929
Because if the background cleaning tasks

1442
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,580
need to go through and touch those old versions of your tables,

1443
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:57,570
they end up pulling them back up to front.

1444
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,149
Right?

1445
00:45:58,229 --> 00:45:58,590
And

1446
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,300
they end up not playing well with intelligent tiering.

1447
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,850
And so the team sat down

1448
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,169
and worked out

1449
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,209
how to make those background maintenance tasks something that we could schedule

1450
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:09,149
in the background,

1451
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:10,989
like genuinely get out of the way.

1452
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,270
And we were able to structure it in a way that let us keep the cost of that out of the way.

1453
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:15,830
And so

1454
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,350
when you turn on intelligent tiering for SV tables,

1455
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,689
background access to the tables to do garbage collection and compaction

1456
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,850
does not change the tier of storage that your data is stored in,

1457
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:27,270
only primary access,

1458
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:28,719
which has been a,

1459
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,850
a really cool innovation on the team side.

1460
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,120
Um,

1461
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:32,620
finally,

1462
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:33,879
we've also rolled out,

1463
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:34,449
uh,

1464
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:34,879
support,

1465
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:35,580
um,

1466
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,290
as we start to fill in features for Iceberg V3.

1467
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,120
So,

1468
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:39,689
um,

1469
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,419
roll lineage,

1470
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,560
deletion vectors

1471
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,100
are into SV tables.

1472
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,689
There's more to come and,

1473
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:45,139
um,

1474
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,000
a bunch of really great engine support for this.

1475
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,219
And so that's the update on SV tables.

1476
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,639
Now,

1477
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,080
SV tables,

1478
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:52,100
objects,

1479
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,459
vectors,

1480
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:55,459
and tables as these like core data constructs.

1481
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,570
Have had this really neat knock-on effect in terms of how people are using storage,

1482
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:02,300
and one thing that I hope resonates with all of

1483
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,379
you as you think about your own systems is one

1484
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,689
property that we're seeing a bit of work that

1485
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,939
almost every customer,

1486
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:10,500
especially with meaningful amounts of data on S3,

1487
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,379
you see it in

1488
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,679
in Cedric's talk,

1489
00:47:12,919 --> 00:47:13,379
um,

1490
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:14,179
what,

1491
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:18,260
what so many folks are realizing is there's enormous value in their data.

1492
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,530
And there's enormous opportunities to grow into new analysis,

1493
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:23,120
new applications on top of it,

1494
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,310
and do new stuff,

1495
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:24,909
but

1496
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,090
they have to cure it,

1497
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:26,600
right?

1498
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:27,550
They end up

1499
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:28,389
building

1500
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,350
effectively metadata layers over the data that they have and in probably,

1501
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:34,129
I don't know,

1502
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:34,709
like

1503
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,469
60 or 70% of the S3 customer conversations that I have

1504
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:40,250
um.

1505
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,100
Somebody is working on this kind of thing.

1506
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:45,820
They're building this type of curated layer for metadata.

1507
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:46,560
And so

1508
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:47,330
last year,

1509
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,479
and a lot of like the thinking that drove us to launch tables in the first place

1510
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,959
was we wanted

1511
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,709
to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of

1512
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,639
being able to build those metadata layers

1513
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,800
and also get you to a metadata

1514
00:47:59,379 --> 00:47:59,959
structure

1515
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,679
in Iceberg and in vector APIs

1516
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:05,850
that you could trust other tools would be built to use,

1517
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,189
right,

1518
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,120
to further amplify the effort

1519
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,100
of collecting your own metadata.

1520
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,649
And so at Reinvent last year we launched S3 metadata.

1521
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:17,409
At Reinvent Last year Metadata was a captured journal

1522
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,479
of mutation events inside a bucket.

1523
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,050
Over the course of this year,

1524
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,770
we've continued to mature metadata,

1525
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:25,669
and now it presents a full both journal

1526
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:27,350
and inventory view

1527
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:28,510
of your bucket.

1528
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,629
And so you can turn on metadata,

1529
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,080
and this is the

1530
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,679
uh the

1531
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,189
the new data notebook

1532
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,340
that that we've launched over the past few weeks,

1533
00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:39,030
and you can

1534
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:39,929
pull up that table,

1535
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:40,409
you can.

1536
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,949
Interrogate properties of all of your objects using SQL queries.

1537
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:46,179
And so you can interact

1538
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:50,020
with the contents of your bucket or prefix in S3

1539
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:50,750
using queries,

1540
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,239
which is really,

1541
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,080
really accelerative.

1542
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,679
You can also use natural language queries converted

1543
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:56,879
to SQL to access information about your bucket,

1544
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,840
and that's the thing that we're seeing folks do all

1545
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,060
sorts of cool stuff with in terms of understanding cost,

1546
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,899
understanding

1547
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,679
where they're growing,

1548
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:04,500
and things like that.

1549
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,560
This primitive of a managed table,

1550
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,280
which is what we use to build estuary metadata.

1551
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,969
It's a read-only table where

1552
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,350
the service manages it and fills it in with the with the content,

1553
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,810
and so in S3 metadata,

1554
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:20,659
the content is high integrity,

1555
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:20,830
right?

1556
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,429
It actually reflects what's in the bucket.

1557
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,469
You can't edit it,

1558
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,649
which allows you to have confidence that it is

1559
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,709
what you think it's going to be.

1560
00:49:27,419 --> 00:49:28,500
That pattern

1561
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,479
actually

1562
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,100
was really,

1563
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,159
really popular

1564
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,520
across customers and across services.

1565
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,139
And so we were almost immediately asked to add it to other things.

1566
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:38,879
So what you see with

1567
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,959
the announcement this morning

1568
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,679
of Amazon Cloudwatch logs being now available inside a managed SUV table

1569
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,899
with uh SV storage lens,

1570
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:48,530
Sagemaker Unified Studio,

1571
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,350
and of course the SV metadata data in there

1572
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,959
is a set of effectively AWS service or system tables

1573
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:58,959
that have state about your use of services.

1574
00:49:59,379 --> 00:49:59,719
And

1575
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:04,110
the really neat thing about this is now you can do joints across all of that data.

1576
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,120
And so

1577
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,840
I'm not gonna call this a simple SQL query,

1578
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,729
um,

1579
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:09,800
but it's not bad.

1580
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,719
Um,

1581
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,260
but you see here,

1582
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,280
like an example query where I'm actually joining across,

1583
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:16,189
um,

1584
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,100
access logs to S3,

1585
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:18,449
uh,

1586
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:19,639
VPC flow logs,

1587
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,860
and the objects in S3.

1588
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,080
And I am triangulating

1589
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:26,540
on 403s on access denied errors,

1590
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,320
not 403s,

1591
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,060
um,

1592
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:28,979
and

1593
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,379
mapping those through to the VPC and the account that ran into the access error.

1594
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:37,899
And so it's like a really powerful tool to be able to do this kind of debugging

1595
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,310
directly with SQL against logs that you already have access to.

1596
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:43,520
Um,

1597
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:44,120
OK,

1598
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,560
the last thing that I would like to talk to you about today,

1599
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,600
um,

1600
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
is enterprise migrations.

1601
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,919
Enterprise migrations are something that continues to be

1602
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:58,090
an absolutely fascinatingly complex challenge,

1603
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:00,239
and it's something that

1604
00:51:00,419 --> 00:51:01,250
we still,

1605
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:01,580
you know,

1606
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:02,879
now 20 years in,

1607
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:03,959
often

1608
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,969
find ourselves supporting customers on,

1609
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:06,760
moving

1610
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:10,040
between enterprise data centers and the cloud,

1611
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:12,250
and from a storage perspective,

1612
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,840
storage often is the kind of like critical component for those migrations.

1613
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:19,000
An enterprise that has,

1614
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:19,600
you know,

1615
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,179
admins managing

1616
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:22,830
loads of servers,

1617
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:24,060
often in VMs,

1618
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:26,959
often finds that it is not trivial,

1619
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,510
but it is workable to move those VMs

1620
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,679
and application workloads into cloud compute constructs.

1621
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,580
But

1622
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,790
the storage admin has a very complicated job,

1623
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,639
and they have lots of bindings and mappings

1624
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,540
of that storage data across the enterprise,

1625
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,939
and they're familiar with the constructs that they have in terms of filers.

1626
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,959
And so

1627
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:46,459
we launched AWS FSX

1628
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,399
as a set

1629
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:48,479
years ago

1630
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:50,159
of managed

1631
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,260
storage offerings,

1632
00:51:51,379 --> 00:51:52,479
managed filers

1633
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:54,120
that you could use to maintain

1634
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:58,100
the same experience of running the enterprise filer in the cloud.

1635
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,280
We have FSX

1636
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,010
for um ZFS,

1637
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,820
FSX for NetApp ONTAP,

1638
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:04,520
um,

1639
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,580
FSX for Windows storage Server,

1640
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,979
and it's a very,

1641
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,399
very popular way

1642
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,520
to initially land data in the cloud and start to build out new workloads.

1643
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,439
Now as FSX continues to grow in adoption,

1644
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,629
a pattern that we have heard in a lot of customer conversations

1645
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:20,840
is

1646
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,800
they love the ability to replicate that data into the cloud,

1647
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,389
take advantage and burst often workloads into the cloud,

1648
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,699
but they'd like to move into cloud-first development.

1649
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,360
You'd like to be able to take all of that data that you've now replicated.

1650
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,000
And light it up under other applications that are written in the cloud,

1651
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,350
often written against object APIs.

1652
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,520
And so things like Amazon Athena,

1653
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:45,350
Bedrock,

1654
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,439
Bedrock Knowledgebases,

1655
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:46,879
Glue,

1656
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:47,909
and Sagemaker,

1657
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:51,919
and bringing those tools to bear against your existing enterprise data.

1658
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,020
And so earlier this year,

1659
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,159
we launched

1660
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:55,669
um

1661
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,179
S3 access points for FSX

1662
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,280
and what this lets you do is stand up an S3 endpoint

1663
00:53:01,459 --> 00:53:03,800
in front of that existing FSX data

1664
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,840
and effectively

1665
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,179
attach to that data as if it was S3.

1666
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,199
And today

1667
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,419
we're extending that initial launch

1668
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,879
of access points for S3 on Open ZFS

1669
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:15,780
with support

1670
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,250
for NetApp ONTA,

1671
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,159
which is

1672
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:18,820
obviously

1673
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:19,360
very,

1674
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:22,739
very broadly deployed and an incredible

1675
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,000
filer for enterprise data centers.

1676
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:29,959
And so with that,

1677
00:53:30,129 --> 00:53:31,350
I'm gonna wrap things up.

1678
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:32,050
Um,

1679
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,320
I hope that,

1680
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,270
um,

1681
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,270
I hope that

1682
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:37,469
I'm able to tell you a story about

1683
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,949
the quiet velocity

1684
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,030
of these teams.

1685
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:40,770
Um,

1686
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:41,520
it's really,

1687
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,110
really

1688
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,570
wonderful to learn about the ways that you work with data

1689
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,689
and build these building blocks that help you move faster.

1690
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,679
And I hope the sense that I'm able to

1691
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:52,800
convey to you today

1692
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:54,129
is the fact that

1693
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,000
80% of what the teams do is like literally

1694
00:53:57,379 --> 00:54:00,219
listening and looking for those sharp edges and continuing to polish,

1695
00:54:00,229 --> 00:54:02,439
and I'm sure we'll still be doing that polishing

1696
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,399
and sanding

1697
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:04,699
10 years from now.

1698
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:09,879
But the work that we've been able to do in this moment of really,

1699
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:12,709
really enormous change that we're seeing over how we build

1700
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,149
over the past few years

1701
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:15,790
has given us this

1702
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:16,770
opening

1703
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,270
to grow and offer new primitives

1704
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:20,770
that are even more meaningful,

1705
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,050
I think,

1706
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:22,850
for the applications and the way that you build

1707
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,879
and so I really hope that you go and play with

1708
00:54:24,879 --> 00:54:26,889
them and I would love to hear what you learned.

1709
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,909
So thank you very much for coming today and enjoy the rest of the week.
