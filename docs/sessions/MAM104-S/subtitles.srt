1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,190
- Thank you very much.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,180
How are you?

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey, thank you very much,
this is so exciting.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,220
So, we're gonna talk a
little bit about agents.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,620
My name's Don Schuerman, I'm CTO at Pega.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,530
We're AWS long-time
partner software company

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,620
based out of Boston, and
we do a lot of automation,

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,900
workflow automation,
decisioning automation

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,700
for some of the world's
largest organizations

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,140
and government agencies.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,090
And if you've been out here today,

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,980
like you guys, everybody's
talking about agents,

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,900
everybody's very excited about agents.

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,210
I also talk to a lot of enterprise CIOs,

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,030
folks who run pretty big
regulated businesses,

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,920
and while they're excited about agents,

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,110
they're also a little
bit scared about agents.

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,300
Because if we're operating
in an agentic world

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,300
where an agent is getting
things right 90 to 95%

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,470
of the time, that's
disastrous if you are a bank,

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,390
if you are a life sciences company,

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,870
if you are a government agency
operating under regulations.

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,210
So, what we wanna talk
a little bit about today

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,550
is how can you build agents that operate

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,290
with a higher degree of predictability?

26
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,000
So you actually get them to do the things

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,010
you want them to do.

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,740
And that starts with
stepping back a little bit

29
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,510
and thinking about some of the technology

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,830
that underpins agents.

31
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,500
So, we start with agents,
but we have to go back

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,080
a little bit and talk a bit about AI.

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,500
And we have a tendency,
I think, as technologists

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,780
to talk about AI as
sort of one giant blob,

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,430
like there's a giant blob of AI

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,140
if you read a lot of the news coverage

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,550
that happens with AI.

38
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,410
But I think those of us who
have worked in the space

39
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,890
for over a decade know AI
actually isn't just one thing.

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,480
It's a bunch of different technologies

41
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,160
that solve different problems.

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,890
And I like to think about AI
in a couple different forms.

43
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,600
There's what I call AI decisioning.

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,710
This is AI that can use structured data

45
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,260
to find predictions, find relationships,

46
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,420
and then use those
predictions to make decisions,

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,210
like what's the best offer
to give to a customer?

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,590
Or how likely is this
process to miss its SLA.

49
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,423
And we do that in Pega.

50
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:55,380
In Pega, we have a product
called Customer Decision Hub,

51
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,060
which my colleagues over at our booth

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,650
would be happy to show you.

53
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,300
Amazon has been doing
this for a while, too.

54
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,160
We use their SageMaker models,

55
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,780
which are really decision-making,

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,780
predictive AI models
built on structured data.

57
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,360
Of course, over the last couple years,

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,670
we all got introduced to generative AI.

59
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,860
And generative AI introduced a whole bunch

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,250
of productivity tools for us.

61
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,810
We've probably all used Copilot.

62
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,850
I go to a lot less meetings these days

63
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,740
because I just wait for
the meeting to be recorded

64
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,440
and for somebody to email me the summary.

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,750
AWS has provided great tools with Bedrock

66
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,760
that we can use to build
these productivity solutions.

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,750
We've got 'em.

68
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,000
You can summarize any case in Pega.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,580
You can use rag-based tools
to get at your knowledge.

70
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,240
You can have coaches that
recommend things to users.

71
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,460
And I think productivity tools are great.

72
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,760
But I also think a lot of
the AI productivity tools

73
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,040
are a lot like Microsoft Excel.

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,450
We would never hire an employee

75
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,540
that doesn't know how to use them,

76
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,010
but we actually aren't gonna
differentiate our business

77
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,860
through the use of AI productivity tools

78
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,063
because everybody's using the same tools.

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,900
So what I'm focused on and
what we're focused on at Pega

80
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,530
is how do I use AI to
drive transformation?

81
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,840
How do I use AI to make
my business better,

82
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,080
to make it different, to actually rethink

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,940
some of the business
processes and ways of working

84
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,680
and customer experiences that we deliver?

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,100
And we've been lucky
enough to partner with AWS

86
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,290
as the only ISV that was present

87
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,000
in their launch of AWS Transform,

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,760
their tools for modernizing mainframe

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
and Java and other applications.

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
And we've done that through a capability

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,330
that we call Gen AI Blueprint.

92
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,260
And Gen AI Blueprint uses
AI capabilities from AWS,

93
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,690
from organizations like Anthropic,

94
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,730
and some of the know-how
that Pega's built out

95
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,200
over the last couple of decades

96
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,080
of automating some of the
most complicated processes

97
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,100
in the world.

98
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,880
And we use it to help you
rethink your business processes

99
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,260
and then be able to apply
agents against those workflows.

100
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,940
Because what happens is
the workflow acts as music.

101
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,470
The workflow gives your agents a score

102
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,210
so that instead of playing random notes

103
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,370
and going off and doing random things,

104
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,640
they're actually operating
together in unison.

105
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,050
And I like to think about Blueprint

106
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,100
as sort of an AI or agentic composer

107
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,250
that helps write the kind of scores

108
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,600
that we need for our business to run,

109
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,510
regardless of the industry
you're working in,

110
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,240
regardless of the area
or domain in the business

111
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,380
that you're working in.

112
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,750
So that's enough from a slide perspective.

113
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,193
What I wanna do is quickly
actually show you Blueprint.

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,400
So this is Blueprint.

115
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,270
You can check it out.

116
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,630
You can go to pega.com/blueprint.

117
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,620
If that's hard to remember,

118
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,630
I'm gonna give you a QR code at the end.

119
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,190
You can also walk over to our booth

120
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,880
that is literally right
directly across from me,

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,020
and people will be happy
to show you Blueprint.

122
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,640
But again, you can do it yourself.

123
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,010
So when you log into Blueprint,

124
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,750
and again, all we're gonna
ask for with Blueprint

125
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,620
is your email address.

126
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,970
We're not gonna spam you.

127
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,890
We're not gonna use anything
you put into Blueprint

128
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,730
to train our data.

129
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,700
This is your tool for
thinking about your business

130
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,170
and how you wanna run it.

131
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,490
But you can come into Blueprint,

132
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,500
and you can first begin
by selecting an industry.

133
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,480
So somebody give me one of these.

134
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,780
What's an industry folks would
wanna do a Blueprint for?

135
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,890
Insurance, awesome.

136
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,660
All right, so we've
worked a lot in insurance

137
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,660
with clients like AIG
and Farmers and Allianz.

138
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,540
So we know that insurance
actually isn't just insurance.

139
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,373
There's different areas.

140
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:22,040
Any one of these particularly
interesting to you?

141
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,090
The first one, commercial
property and casualty.

142
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,330
So this is like actually
insuring businesses.

143
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,730
So building the insurance
process for businesses.

144
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,050
And actually inside of insurance,

145
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,700
I can type whatever I want here,

146
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,650
but let's deal with claims.

147
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,760
That sounds, makes sense, great.

148
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,163
Claims are always
interesting and complicated.

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,610
So now I describe a little bit more

150
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,530
about what I want this application to do.

151
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,720
So I could do end-to-end
claims management.

152
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm gonna select first notice of loss.

153
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,570
So that's like the intake.

154
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,890
If something goes wrong,

155
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,780
you've got a fire at your pizza place.

156
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,827
You call your property
insurer and you say,

157
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,567
"Hey, I need to get my
pizza ovens replaced

158
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,210
"'cause I had a fire."

159
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,400
So related to new claims promoted,

160
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,400
focus on small business
owners like restaurants.

161
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,370
So maybe we've got a little bit of focus.

162
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,650
Well, let's do this for
an insurance company

163
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,030
that might offer this kind of stuff.

164
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,613
So let's, I'm just gonna
throw Farmers out here.

165
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,280
There we go, Farmers Group.

166
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,780
Oh, actually, sorry, Farmers Insurance

167
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,543
is the one that I want, but
we'll grab the right one.

168
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,040
Well, Farmers Group.

169
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,790
We'll go with Farmers Group, sorry.

170
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,930
And I can do this in different languages,

171
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,310
but I don't speak any of them well,

172
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,060
so I'm gonna do it in
English if that's okay.

173
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,620
And what happens now is Blueprint

174
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,270
starts going and doing searching.

175
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,610
It's looking at a rag-based database

176
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,520
that we have of industry best practices.

177
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,250
We also work with partners like Capgemini

178
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,290
and EY and Accenture,

179
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,720
and they actually have their
own versions of Blueprint

180
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,490
that have embedded some
of the best practices

181
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,510
that they've built.

182
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,280
It's also looking at some of the things

183
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,130
around the structure of
an enterprise application.

184
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,570
And what Blueprint has identified

185
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,510
is that in order to automate
the first notice of loss

186
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,860
for our insurance company,

187
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,030
I need to be doing a couple

188
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,230
of different types of workflows.

189
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,090
I need to be able to take in a claim.

190
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,860
I need to do a damage assessment.

191
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,710
I need to understand if there
was a business interruption.

192
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,530
So this is all stuff that
Blueprint has figured out

193
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,920
through AI and by looking at
understanding best practices

194
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,570
available either in our database or

195
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,980
in the broader internet.

196
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,900
And it suggested some workflows to you.

197
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,580
I can change these.

198
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,700
If I wanna edit them, if I
wanna add more, I can add more.

199
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,050
But from here, I'm just gonna go

200
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,210
and let Blueprint continue to work.

201
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,730
And it's now gonna take
each one of those workflows

202
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,460
that I defined, and it's gonna figure out

203
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,230
all of the steps of the workflow,

204
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,430
what's gonna be automated,

205
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,720
what's gonna be done by an agent,

206
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,220
what's gonna be done by a human.

207
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,110
It's gonna figure out
what are the data models

208
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,910
that need to run underneath
this application.

209
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,040
So what fields do I need to collect?

210
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,470
It's gonna suggest the
places where this application

211
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,410
would need to interface
with other data objects

212
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,880
like my policy admin system

213
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,250
that are gonna live
somewhere in my business.

214
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,900
It's gonna think about who the users

215
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,520
of this application are.

216
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,880
So who's gonna use this application

217
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,340
and what different types
of security privileges

218
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,790
and user experiences do they need?

219
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,410
And then it's gonna think
about all the channels

220
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,970
that I wanna have this
application running on.

221
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,820
So what Blueprint has now done, right,

222
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,740
and what, we've been doing
this for about two minutes,

223
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,920
right, Blueprint has now
actually created for me

224
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,700
a full application for
first notice of loss

225
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,220
for a commercial insurer.

226
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,470
So it understands how to intake a claim,

227
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,290
do things like verify policy information.

228
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,470
It basically has laid out
the business-specific steps

229
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,090
this workflow needs to do.

230
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,850
And if I wanna change the
order of these things,

231
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,620
I can drag and drop them around,

232
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,720
I can add steps, I can remove steps.

233
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,000
This is mine to configure at this point.

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,310
AI's made a whole bunch of suggestions,

235
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,120
but the end user gets
to make the decisions

236
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,480
of what is actually happening.

237
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,700
Blueprint's also figured
out the data model.

238
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,060
So what do I need to collect
in order to run this case?

239
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,400
It even suggests some business rules.

240
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,440
My AI's still running in the background,

241
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,090
but the Blueprint will actually suggest

242
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,530
business rules and decisions

243
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,100
and build you out decision tables

244
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,390
for what this application needs to do.

245
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,670
And it's done this not
just for one, right,

246
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,900
but it's done this for things like

247
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,180
my damage assessment process,

248
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,850
it's done this for anything
like business interruption

249
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,350
if I need to manage that.

250
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,680
So it's done this for the
full suite of my applications.

251
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,260
It's also figured out what's
the data model that I need,

252
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,240
right, so I need to go
get my policy information.

253
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,870
Now, my policy information is
probably not sitting in PEGA,

254
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,100
so I can go in and change that.

255
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,157
I can say that, no, actually
I want my policy information

256
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,693
that's gonna come out of
my policy admin system.

257
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,020
And so now we're building the data maps

258
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,720
of where this workflow
needs to interface out

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,590
to different systems.

260
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,590
In fact, if you come to
Blueprint with existing YAMLs,

261
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,300
right, so definitions of REST files,

262
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,360
if you come to Blueprint with
existing DDLs from databases,

263
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
we can just import those
directly into the Blueprint

264
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,423
and use them.

265
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,920
And then finally, the
Blueprint has figured out,

266
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,660
well, who are the people
who are gonna use this app.

267
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,070
So I'm gonna have a restaurant owner

268
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,600
who is probably gonna submit this,

269
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,700
my claims adjuster, the insurance agent

270
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,970
who needs to be notified,
my claims supervisor,

271
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,610
my risk assessor, all of that.

272
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,260
Cool, so now I've built this,

273
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,600
but here's the really cool thing.

274
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,550
If you've done a lot of sort of projects

275
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,720
and requirements gathering,

276
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,700
and you've got your business
people and your IT people,

277
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,560
and everybody's trying to get together,

278
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,740
too often you're operating in
sort of a state of blindness.

279
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,210
The business people don't really know

280
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,920
what they're gonna get
at the end of the day.

281
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,810
The IT people don't really actually know

282
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,280
what they have to build.

283
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,200
So we get project delays,

284
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
we get things that are inaccurate,

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,100
we get things that don't
actually deliver the value

286
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,990
that they were expected to deliver.

287
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,040
So the power of Blueprint
is that I can, right now,

288
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,790
I can actually run the application.

289
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,420
So this is now a running

290
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,610
prototype of my claims application,

291
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,740
where I can actually go through,

292
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,240
and I can intake a claim,

293
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,210
we're using AI to generate
a bunch of synthetic data

294
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,010
so that I can test this.

295
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,500
But I can literally step through

296
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,773
all the various stages
of my claims process.

297
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,400
I can do that not just in a desktop,

298
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,740
if I wanted to see what that
looks like on a mobile app,

299
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,560
I can preview that experience.

300
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,390
A lot of our clients are
Salesforce customers,

301
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,220
so we're often the workflow engine

302
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,000
sitting behind Salesforce.

303
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,540
So we've got a pre-built
Lightning component

304
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,670
where our workflow runs natively

305
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,960
inside of Salesforce Lightning,

306
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,513
so you can actually
see our workflow there.

307
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,290
We're also a contact center app,

308
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,570
so we show up in Gartner's Magic Quadrant

309
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,550
as a leader in the contact center space,

310
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,230
so I can embed all of these workflows

311
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,580
directly in a contact center app

312
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,070
that incidentally
integrates with AWS Connect,

313
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,650
so you can do your telephony that way.

314
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,023
We can do some self-service
if we wanna do it.

315
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:52,230
So I can embed this right
on the farmer's homepage.

316
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,753
But we talked about having
conversational agents.

317
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,310
So what I've done now,

318
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,130
and again, I haven't written any prompts,

319
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,240
I haven't done any coding,

320
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,900
but I now have a conversational agent

321
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,010
that can do work on my customer's behalf.

322
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,400
So if my customer comes in

323
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
and sells the agent that he had a fire

324
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,920
in the restaurant,

325
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
the agent is going to use the workflows

326
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,070
that we just built as
its collection of prompts

327
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,543
and data for what it can do.

328
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,040
And now it's gonna have a
conversation with the customer,

329
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,740
but the agent isn't randomly
figuring out what to do.

330
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,840
It's not doing a whole bunch
of reasoning at runtime.

331
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,390
It knows the workflows it needs to follow,

332
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,460
so it's going to now drive through

333
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,240
the exact process that it needs to do.

334
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,583
So it wants to know
when the fire occurred,

335
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,380
right, I'll type that in.

336
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,720
And behind the scenes,

337
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,340
we're just building out a case.

338
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,420
We're literally following the workflow

339
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,843
that I just defined
via AI two minutes ago.

340
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,570
And the cool thing is I
can use the agentic AI

341
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,810
to do things that the LLM
is really good at doing,

342
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,600
like semantically mapping
me to the right workflow

343
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,073
or changing the language

344
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,330
of the conversation that I wanna have.

345
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,930
All still the same workflow,

346
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,710
all being consistently executed,

347
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,080
but now allowing me to
have an agentic interface

348
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,223
into how you do it.

349
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,510
The other powerful thing
that we've built into Pega

350
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,970
is the ability not only
to have an agent come in

351
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,740
and call those workflows,

352
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,840
we do that, by the way, via MCP.

353
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,970
So if you wanna plug in
another agentic front end,

354
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,410
you certainly can.

355
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,870
This agent that I'm
running here supports A2A,

356
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,100
so if you wanted to connect it up

357
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,870
to one of your other agents, great,

358
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,720
they're all gonna work well together.

359
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,270
But we also can then
start embedding agents

360
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,760
at individual steps of the workflow.

361
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,370
So maybe I need an
agent that's really good

362
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,580
at validating photos
of the evidence, right,

363
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,770
and calculating a damage estimate.

364
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,960
Maybe I have an agent
that's good at identifying

365
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,960
a signature and validating
that the customer

366
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,330
has signed off on the claim
that they're submitting.

367
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,300
I can embed those agents in my workflow

368
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,650
so that I get more and more automation,

369
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,150
but because I'm restricting them

370
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,460
to an individual step of the workflow,

371
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,650
I don't have to worry
about them going haywire,

372
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,060
I don't have to worry about consuming

373
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,830
a bunch of tokens I don't need,

374
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,990
and I can treat the
agents the exact same way

375
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,280
I would treat a human.

376
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,810
I can quality check their work,

377
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,370
I can escalate to somebody else

378
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,320
if they can't get the work done properly.

379
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,690
So we provide that ability
to have both agents

380
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,300
on the top and agents on
the bottom of your workflow.

381
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,460
So that's Blueprint.

382
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,830
You can check it out yourself
at pega.com/blueprint,

383
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,710
you can go check it out at our booth.

384
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,380
The other thing that we're
beginning to see happen,

385
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,670
and what we've been thinking
a lot about at PEGA,

386
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,450
is where we think the world is going.

387
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,010
And I actually think that we're entering

388
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,790
a world increasingly where
our users and our customers

389
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,400
aren't gonna interact with applications

390
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,470
in the way that they used to.

391
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,140
Right, right now, the
way we make our users

392
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,220
interact with applications,

393
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,960
anybody ever walk
through a contact center?

394
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,020
Anybody ever spent time
inside a contact center?

395
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,680
Like the hellish life of a
contact center front end.

396
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,500
Oftentimes, contact center users will have

397
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,320
four, five, six different
applications they need to go to,

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,270
'cause they have one
application that does one thing,

399
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,160
and they have another
application do another thing.

400
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,580
And so often, we actually
put that experience

401
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,430
not only on our users, we
shove it out to our customers.

402
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,570
Where you have to call one number

403
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,530
if you wanna get one service,

404
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,940
and you gotta go talk to another group.

405
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,770
We're exposing our organization

406
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,350
and system silos to our customers.

407
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,960
And I actually think one
of the big transformations

408
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,250
that agents are gonna drive

409
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,893
is a lot of that complexity
can now be hidden.

410
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,950
Because instead of
thinking of our business

411
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,570
as a collection of applications

412
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,270
that a user needs to switch between,

413
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,740
I wanna increasingly
think about my business

414
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,410
as a catalog, a fabric.

415
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,810
And that fabric consists of workflows,

416
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,510
things that I can do on
behalf of my employee

417
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,310
or on behalf of my customer.

418
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,380
That fabric consists of knowledge.

419
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,350
What do I know that could
answer a question for them.

420
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,530
What kind of things are
covered by my insurance policy?

421
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,990
And that fabric consists of data.

422
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,760
What are the actual pieces of information

423
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,920
that a customer might wanna see?

424
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,200
What was my last bill on my policy?

425
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,760
When is it due.

426
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,330
And if I can take and
make that fabric available

427
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,100
and weave those workflows together,

428
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,790
we do this through what we call
our agentic process fabric,

429
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,810
I can now allow a customer
to have a single point in

430
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,580
to all of the workflows in the business,

431
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,350
whether the workflows live in Pega

432
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,780
or frankly, whether the
workflows live somewhere else.

433
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,550
Whether that data happens to live in Pega,

434
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,020
whether that data lives in Redshift,

435
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,460
whether that data lives in Databricks,

436
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,880
whether that data lives somewhere else.

437
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,080
And as we are increasingly
working with our partners at AWS

438
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,440
with the transform tool,
our partners like Capgemini,

439
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,650
who recently announced a
composable marketplace offering

440
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,290
to modernize Lotus Notes, Accenture,

441
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,540
who just announced a
composable marketplace offering

442
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,020
with us in transform to
modernize mainframe applications.

443
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,450
We're gonna be able to accelerate the path

444
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,960
for a lot of our clients
to take what are outdated,

445
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,790
siloed mainframe experiences

446
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,370
and bring them into this
modern agentic future.

447
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,760
And that's the future that
we think is gonna happen.

448
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,380
It's gonna be driven by agents.

449
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,810
It's gonna be governed
and bounded by workflows.

450
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,670
It's gonna deliver better experiences,

451
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,590
but it's gonna be in
the predictable fashion

452
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,150
that businesses demand.

453
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,970
So that's how you can pretty quickly

454
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,270
start deploying predictable
agents in your enterprise.

455
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,500
What I would encourage you, though,

456
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,280
is the great thing about
Blueprint is you can test it out.

457
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
You can try out the experience.

458
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,190
You can throw your own process into it.

459
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,450
You could do, you know,

460
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,450
blueprint a business process
like we do with claims.

461
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,773
You could blueprint,

462
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,210
I blueprinted my daughter's
college application process

463
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,310
recently, right, to kind
of get my some sense

464
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,930
of sort of what that's gonna look like.

465
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,160
But try it out.

466
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,510
Offer us any feedback.

467
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,120
Come see us at the booth over there.

468
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
We're really excited to be
partnering with AWS on this,

469
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,530
and we look forward to driving
a lot of transformation

470
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,430
over the next couple of years.

471
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,780
So thank you all very much.

472
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,750
Thanks for spending the time.

473
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,750
(audience applauds)
