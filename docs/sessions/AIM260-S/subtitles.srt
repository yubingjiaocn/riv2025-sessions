00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,600
- Hello everybody, my
name is Spiros Xanthos

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,600
and together with Josh and Angelo,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,574
we'll tell you a bit about, you know,

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:12,600
how we built and use
an AI SRE to help with,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,050
to help troubleshoot
incidents around production.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm the founder, CEO of a
company called Resolve AI.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,620
You have probably seen us
on your lanyards this week.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,350
We built agents

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,430
that can use and run for tools

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,230
like a software engineer,
let's say, all production tools

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,230
from code to observability
to infrastructure,

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,400
with the goal, like I said,

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,250
of accelerating incident
troubleshooting, remediation,

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,650
but also helping run
production more broadly.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,260
And today we're gonna share
information of how we,

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,870
what are the challenges in
building a product like this

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,420
and how can it be used in production.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,910
A bit about myself,

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,670
I worked in observability
all of my career.

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,970
I previously built two companies,

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,940
a log analytics product
called Log Insight.

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,063
I dropped outta my PhD
to build that in 2008.

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,070
We ended up getting
acquired by VMware in 2012.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,600
And then together with Mayank,

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,240
who's my co-founder at Resolve as well,

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,000
we co-created OpenTelemetry in 2018

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,300
and built a observability
platform called Omnition

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,410
around that.

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,470
At the time, our thesis was that

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,050
to build more powerful
observability solutions,

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,570
we had to essentially move
away from proprietary standards

32
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,820
and to, you know, open
telemetry in many ways.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,740
Both provided an open standard,

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,173
but also an implementation
that we could use.

35
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,777
That company got acquired by Splunk

36
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:44,777
and then I had the luck to
run a large production system

37
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,920
with very strict SLAs.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,770
And I saw first hand
how hard that is, right?

39
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,690
And we had times where we
would pose production bushes

40
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,670
for like a month, around
this time actually,

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,400
because many of our
customers were e-commerce.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,410
And also there was a period of time

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,610
where 90% of our SRE team
resigned because of burnout.

44
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,250
And that was partially the motivation

45
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,680
for me and Mayank to work on Resolve,

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,070
to not create yet another
tool that humans can use,

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,920
but rather create agents
that work alongside humans

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,957
and make the life of, let's say,

49
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:21,690
SRE and software engineers better,

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,540
while also they improve the outcomes.

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,530
Now, software engineering in our view

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,150
is like two parts, right?

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,980
It's the coding and building,

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,930
and then it's the running
of the production.

55
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,690
And when you're writing code

56
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,070
or when you're creating software,

57
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,180
you have to have a lot of context

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,820
about production and vice versa.

59
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,810
When you're running production,

60
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,700
you need to understand
the application logic,

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,017
the infrastructure and all of that.

62
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:50,523
And what we have seen so
far is that, you know,

63
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,110
AI had already a lot of impact

64
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,600
in the coding part, right,
in the building of software.

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm pretty sure many of you actually,

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,810
how many of you are using, let's say,

67
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,693
an agent to write code in production?

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,210
You know, we started obviously like,

69
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,170
probably two, three years ago

70
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,250
after GPT-3.5 with GitHub Copilot,

71
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,440
and that was more like
an assistant to a human,

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,700
more like auto completion.

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,000
Humans were still in the
driver's seat completely, but,

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
and of course it was like
the first wave in some sense

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,260
and we got some acceleration,

76
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,600
but still mostly we're
moving at the speed of,

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,950
let's say, human execution.

78
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,350
The second wave,

79
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,290
which I would say probably
landed about a year ago,

80
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,250
is when we started having
agents that, you know,

81
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,980
did more autonomous work
in creating code, right?

82
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,650
Essentially we moved from humans being,

83
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,260
let's say, the operator
of an ID almost now

84
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,850
to an agent being the operator

85
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,150
and the human now managing,
let's say the agent,

86
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,530
but still, you know, this
is for only a small part

87
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,780
of what the work of a software engineer is

88
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,953
in many ways, right?

89
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,890
We have some data statistics

90
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,820
and I'm curious for those of you

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,870
who work in bigger companies,

92
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,730
what is your take on this?

93
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,000
But really the time software engineers

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,140
spend in writing code is
usually like 10 to 20 to 30%,

95
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,820
especially for brownfield applications.

96
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,260
Of course, if you're starting new

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,610
and building a new application,

98
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,730
maybe you spend 80% of
your time writing code,

99
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,170
but that's usually not the case

100
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,520
when you're dealing with existing systems

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,220
that have been around for a while.

102
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,980
Where does the rest of the time go?

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,220
It's obviously goes into
maintaining, troubleshooting,

104
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,710
running, optimizing production.

105
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,410
And that's a very hard problem.

106
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,090
It's a very hard problem for humans

107
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,700
and it's a very hard problem for models.

108
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,810
Our view in some sense

109
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,490
is that models have solved
coding to some extent

110
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,990
and it's not uncommon to see

111
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,990
that 8% of code might
be generated by model.

112
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,490
But that doesn't mean we're moving,

113
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,870
let's say five times faster, right?

114
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,160
Because that's not enough

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,660
to accelerate the whole lifecycle

116
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,033
of software development and production.

117
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,003
Now why is this hard.

118
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:05,836
This is hard

119
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:08,610
because if you're dealing with
the entire software stack,

120
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,870
right, the whole production system,

121
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,280
you're dealing not just with code,

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,380
which is obviously an
important part of it,

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,530
but now you're dealing
with a lot of tools.

124
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,730
Think of like observability
tools, CICD pipelines,

125
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,157
many times we have multiple
of these tools that,

126
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,357
and they were not
designed to work together.

127
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,690
The data is siloed.

128
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,490
Oftentimes we even have like two tools

129
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,660
for the same type of data, right?

130
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,270
It's not uncommon that
your infrastructure metrics

131
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,350
might be living in one tool

132
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,690
and then your application
metrics in another tool.

133
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,000
And of course then you
have also infrastructure

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
that by itself is very dynamic and complex

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,500
and again, it's not uncommon

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,200
that somebody might be running
across multiple clouds.

137
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,743
Now, on top of all this
complexity, let's say of tooling,

138
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,810
it takes multiple, let's say
different types of expertise

139
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,120
to run a production system.

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,703
It takes, you know, there is,

141
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,480
and you know, oftentimes
let's say this expertise

142
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
might be combined in a single human right,

143
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,260
we have oftentimes application developers

144
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,900
who are on-call and manage
infrastructure as well, right?

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,750
But in reality it's kind of
a different skill to write,

146
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,090
let's say, an application
versus to manage a platform

147
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,823
or to even like debug an
infrastructure problem.

148
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,710
And then on top of that,
unlike let's say code

149
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,260
that is self-documenting,
for the most part,

150
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,510
production is never fully documented.

151
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,390
Usually the knowledge
of how to run production

152
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,960
lives across tools, let's say,
your dashboards, your alerts,

153
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,190
across documents, runbooks,
SOPs, prior incidents,

154
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,440
but oftentimes just in human minds.

155
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,690
And that's what makes
it very, very difficult

156
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,910
for any human in reality,

157
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,040
but also for for AI as well.

158
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,113
And what is the effect of all that?

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,950
You know, reliability
obviously is a priority

160
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,280
for anyone who delivers,
you know, the business

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,497
through software and,

162
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,740
but it usually comes at a very
high cost of humans, tools

163
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,720
and oftentimes it's not even achieved

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,580
despite this very high cost.

165
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,100
It's not gonna be
uncommon if you ask a CTO

166
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,660
what to rank their expenses,

167
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,390
they will tell you, of course,
engineers is the top expense.

168
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,387
You know, maybe the cloud is a second,

169
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,410
observability is my third.

170
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,140
But despite all that, you know, war rooms

171
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,870
and you know, escalations are
very, very common occurrence

172
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,260
and oftentimes involved tens of people.

173
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,670
And even in scenarios where, let's say,

174
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,070
you have maybe an a network
operations center, right?

175
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,910
Or like L1 SRE versus, you
know, software engineer on-call,

176
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,010
typically escalations happen all the time.

177
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,410
The other thing we see often

178
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,840
and have some very
interesting stories to share,

179
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,420
maybe afterwards you have
time, is that infrastructure,

180
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,300
extremely infrastructure
observability comes at a huge cost

181
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,680
'cause they're very over-provisioned.

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,540
We're actually in our effort

183
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,010
to ensure when something goes wrong,

184
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,600
we have the data to
troubleshoot the problem.

185
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,570
Obviously we collect
as much datas possible

186
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,720
and then also an infrastructure
itself is over-provisioned

187
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,980
to ensure like if something goes wrong

188
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,983
or you know, if you have
a spike you can handle it.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,260
And you know,

190
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,490
brownfield development in particular

191
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,980
is a very, very huge challenge
because of the complexity

192
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,750
and you know, the large system

193
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,420
and the lack of, let's say it is difficult

194
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,030
for any human to know the entire system.

195
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,630
So we see very commonly in, you know,

196
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,890
when we talk to our customers

197
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,630
or even from our own experience,

198
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,710
that there's usually a small
set of humans that are experts

199
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,650
and you know, instead
of maybe being building

200
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,420
or architecting, they end
up firefighting all the time

201
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,070
because obviously when
something goes wrong,

202
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,530
it takes precedence over everything else.

203
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,780
And you know, usually when a new engineer

204
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,880
or SRE joins an organization,

205
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
it takes them probably a week

206
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,520
to submit the first PR

207
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,920
but takes them up six months or longer

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,334
to be primary on-call.

209
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,167
And why is that?

210
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,420
Because there is so much
context that you need to absorb.

211
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,160
You might have all the
expertise as a human, right?

212
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,930
You are probably an expertise SRE

213
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,880
but then you join a new organization

214
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,260
and you know, you have
to learn all the things

215
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,260
about that production
system that is quite unique

216
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,023
compared to what you've seen before.

217
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,480
And of course when an expert resigns,

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,530
you don't just lose their skills,

219
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,740
you lose all this accumulated
experience about the system.

220
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,420
And of course AI generated
code just makes this all worse.

221
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,330
Just focusing on maybe
the most painful part

222
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,950
of running a production system,

223
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,560
which is being on-call and
dealing with incidents.

224
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,710
It is quite common to see
situations where first of all,

225
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,110
maybe if you're the
person that gets called

226
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,400
to troubleshoot the problem,

227
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,930
usually you have a call start, right?

228
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,080
It's a very stressful situation
to be in as an individual.

229
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,820
It's probably one of the hardest things

230
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,950
when at three in the morning,
let's say you get paged

231
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,260
and you have to go figure
out what's going on

232
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,110
with all the pressure of
what if I don't do right?

233
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,300
All the downside effects of that, right?

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,010
We also see quite common to
have like huge incident tunnels

235
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,513
with like, sorry,

236
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,160
with 20 plus people

237
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
or it's not even uncommon

238
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,880
to have like especially
larger enterprises,

239
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,400
situations where maybe
one team gets paged,

240
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,360
they don't solve the problem,

241
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,320
another team gets paged,

242
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,153
they don't solve the problem,

243
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:06,000
a third thing gets paged,

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,080
they don't solve the problem

245
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,600
until you end up like
in the networking team

246
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
because it's the DNS, I suppose.

247
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,940
And you have all these people
now in a Slack channel,

248
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,230
maybe a hundred of them

249
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,090
trying to figure out
what's going on, right?

250
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,730
And you often even see that

251
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,560
maybe people remediate the problem

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,833
but then the actual cause is
not found for another few days.

253
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,120
And I think especially now

254
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,670
that we started generating a lot of code,

255
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,900
but not only because of that, right,

256
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,650
like we're creating a lot more software,

257
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,960
a lot more technology.

258
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
And that's very desirable
in my view, right,

259
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,840
like that's good for the world.

260
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,910
But you know, managing all that software

261
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,530
becomes a lot harder.

262
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,860
And you know, we have
like fragmented tools,

263
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,290
we have, you know, very large systems

264
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,900
that it's impossible for any
human to know by themselves.

265
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,850
And to some degree, maybe like the silo

266
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,630
can kind of effect we
have is desirable, right?

267
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,120
For anyone who tried maybe to
go through a transformation

268
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,850
and maybe, you know,
implement observability,

269
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,860
you know how hard it is to move

270
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,150
from one system to another, right?

271
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,280
And oftentimes maybe one,

272
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,750
one tool is very good for infrastructure.

273
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,280
Another tool is very good for applications

274
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,250
and maybe it's desirable
to have these, you know,

275
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,640
data separated and used
by different tools.

276
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,260
But okay, what is, I guess,

277
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,110
the solution to all of these problems

278
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:23,880
I talked about?

279
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,790
So we do believe that we're about to move

280
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,060
or we're in the process of
moving to this third wave of AI,

281
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,070
let's say in software
engineering, more broadly,

282
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,470
that applies to software
engineering, NSRE,

283
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,770
which is, let's say humans

284
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,930
until let's say maybe two years ago,

285
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,570
were both the operator of
all the tools they had,

286
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,260
you know, in a development environment

287
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,090
and also the glue across them, right?

288
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,640
For most tasks you probably
have to look into code,

289
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,690
you have to look into logs,

290
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,520
you have to understand your infrastructure

291
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,673
and combine the information
to get to some task completed.

292
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,810
I think now we have moved to maybe

293
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,580
oftentimes agents being the operators

294
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,260
of these tools individually

295
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,730
and then a human is the glue, right?

296
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,770
So you might have an
agent write code for you,

297
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,603
you might even have an agent

298
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,830
that can query system
better than you can do it,

299
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,040
but then you still are the person

300
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,580
who's a human is stitching
together the information.

301
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,070
But I think we're about
to move to this new world,

302
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,520
let's say, where agents are
both the operators and the glue

303
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,840
and the humans will be operating

304
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,490
at a higher level of abstraction.

305
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,240
And we think that's the path forward.

306
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
But this path forward involves
essentially a few things,

307
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,130
right, that are very, very hard.

308
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,720
But I think we're getting there

309
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,510
and if I have an insight
to serve from my experience

310
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,220
working day and night with AI

311
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,180
for the last couple of years

312
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,330
is that I think agents are
gonna work in production

313
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,160
as well as they work for code today

314
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,540
and we're actually almost there

315
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,880
and the impact is gonna be even bigger

316
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,560
'cause these are harder and more stressful

317
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,180
and more painful problems.

318
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,250
But of course to do that we
need to be able essentially

319
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,050
to take the expertise of humans

320
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,210
across all of these different disciplines

321
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,680
and kind of encode it into agents

322
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,640
or give the agents the
tools that humans possess.

323
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,780
We need to understand,

324
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,750
make the agents understand and
operate all the human tools

325
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,070
because obviously all
the software environments

326
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,110
in the world today were
built for humans to operate.

327
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,230
So agents have to essentially
learn how to operate

328
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,660
and understand these
environments the way human would

329
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,250
and maybe the hardest
or the most important

330
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,560
is that each environment is unique.

331
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,760
So we have to be able to
build agents that kind of

332
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,160
can both discover knowledge
the way human would,

333
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,080
but also learn from
every interaction, right?

334
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,060
So over time they become better and better

335
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,240
at working with alongside
humans in getting results.

336
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,250
And it's not a frustrating experience.

337
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,960
And of course as you maybe all know,

338
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,310
models don't have memory.

339
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,570
So this is a very, very hard part

340
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,800
of building an agentic system

341
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,180
because all of that has to happen

342
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,580
outside of the ways of the model.

343
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,240
And that's kind of the
solution we built at Resolve,

344
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,210
basically we are a multi-agent system.

345
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,530
Maybe a simple way to think about it,

346
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,280
like your typical coding
agent is one agentic loop

347
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,400
with probably 10 to 20
tools that the agent can use

348
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,500
to produce code, understand
and produce code.

349
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,770
Resolve is about 10 of those,

350
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,970
for code, logs, metrics,
infrastructure, knowledge documents

351
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,790
that we all have to work
together in accomplishing tasks.

352
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,950
The most common tasks
humans use Resolve for

353
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,050
is to be on-call, troubleshoot

354
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,940
and remediate alerts and incidents.

355
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,880
And typically every, any
alert involves going,

356
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,650
let's say from code to metrics to logs,

357
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,000
back and forth a few times,

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,130
as you probably have know those of you

359
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,290
who have have done this type of work

360
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,790
until it gets an answer.

361
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,410
But also if you think about it,

362
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,630
most tasks humans have to do in production

363
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,430
have similar characteristics.

364
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,263
And that's why we believe

365
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:41,220
that by building a multi-agentic system

366
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,080
that can operate the tools as a human,

367
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,340
that can learn from humans

368
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,340
and allows humans to now
essentially instruct this system

369
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,260
almost like a junior engineer

370
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,510
can be very, very
effective in accelerating

371
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,490
and how we run production systems,

372
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,500
but also making our lives easier

373
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,970
at an individual level, right,

374
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,410
like it's not as painful

375
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,750
hopefully if you get paged
at three in the morning

376
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,463
or maybe you don't even get paged anymore

377
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:03,296
at three in the morning, right?

378
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,560
An agent gets paged

379
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,330
and if it not solve the problem,

380
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,480
then you know you are
the escalation point.

381
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,970
And one thing that maybe I would say

382
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,010
that surprised me in building Resolve

383
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,633
is how quickly,

384
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,090
when we started the company,

385
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,180
we didn't even know people
will trust an AI in production.

386
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,610
And now you know, we are working
with some of the largest,

387
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,040
you know, technology and
finance services companies

388
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,873
in the world

389
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:29,250
and are very surprised by
how quickly people adopt it

390
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,960
or (indistinct) has adopted this

391
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,790
and you know, Angelo,
who's here from Coinbase,

392
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,830
can explain that part in a bit.

393
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,890
But with that I'm gonna pass it on to Josh

394
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,723
who's gonna give some more details

395
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,533
about the technology and give a demo.

396
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,673
- I get the exciting part
so I get to do the demo,

397
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:53,010
but I'm also standing
in the way of Angelo,

398
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,740
so I know you're all here
to to hear from Coinbase.

399
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,750
So I want to give you a little glimpse

400
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,700
into how the product works,

401
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,253
how it's used, and let's jump in.

402
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,050
So we're here to talk about
AI for incidents, AI SRE,

403
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,960
that's what's commonly referred to today.

404
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,180
However, when you think about an AI SRE,

405
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,420
there's a lot it can do beyond
just resolving incidents,

406
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,270
resolving incidents is kind
of starting with the pinnacle,

407
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,620
the hardest part of the equation

408
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,630
because of these complex systems,

409
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,070
everything is changing,

410
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,770
knowledge is locked up in
each individual's heads

411
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,430
as well as unstructured and
structured datacross systems.

412
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,820
And interestingly, when
Spiros and I were doing a demo

413
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,750
early on in the days,

414
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,280
probably about a year and a half ago,

415
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,380
to a head of technology,

416
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,140
I think the world's largest
music streaming company,

417
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,610
the thing that he saw

418
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,890
when he saw us do an incident walkthrough,

419
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,480
so an alert fires,

420
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,313
we triage it,

421
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,970
within minutes, you have a root cause.

422
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,860
He said, "Hey, this is amazing."

423
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,990
He's like, "But what I really see here

424
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,930
is giving us those incremental gains

425
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,240
and keeping my engineers
in their flow state."

426
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,900
Because what an SRE does
is not just incidents,

427
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,880
they're kind of that
catchall for everything

428
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,990
about your operations.

429
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,340
Whether it's platform engineering,

430
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,140
how does CICD work,

431
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,580
let's optimize our costs,

432
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,710
let's do capacity planning and so forth.

433
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,030
But by starting with incidents,

434
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,410
if you do that really well,

435
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,360
it unlocks everything else.

436
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,760
There's a new book out by Nicole Forsgren

437
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,050
called "Frictionless."

438
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,390
And it talks a lot about
developer experience

439
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,640
and friction created by the systems,

440
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,940
the adoption of AI in the
new world plus the old world.

441
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,890
And what she latches onto

442
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,690
is the importance of keeping individuals

443
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,523
in their flow state.

444
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:34,110
So giving them the autonomy to actually go

445
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,500
and get context when they
need it to unblock themselves.

446
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,950
She also talks about cognitive load

447
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,440
and reducing that cognitive
load through abstractions

448
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,150
and new modern tools.

449
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,040
And so what I wanna show you in the demo

450
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,240
is not only the incidents

451
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
because that's what you're here to see,

452
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
but I also wanna show you
what the possibilities are

453
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,243
in using tools like this.

454
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,460
So I've worked with Spiros and Mayank

455
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,320
many times previously in Omnition.

456
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,240
What we learned in building
observability tools

457
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,350
or any developer tool

458
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,730
is you kind of want to embed yourself

459
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,410
into the workflow already.

460
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,450
And so a common way to use Resolve

461
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,310
is directly through Slack.

462
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,680
Many of you, if you've
been in incidents before,

463
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,060
you're part of these alert channels

464
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,190
or when an incident is declared,

465
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,084
a channel is spun up.

466
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:21,090
And this could be in
Teams, Slack, wherever.

467
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,560
And what ends up happening

468
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,720
is you're given something like this,

469
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,070
an alert you're probably
not that familiar with,

470
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,440
it doesn't have a lot more
than probably a dashboard

471
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,310
that you're gonna follow.

472
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,080
You're gonna look at a bunch of panels,

473
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,900
then you're gonna go
and drum up a log query.

474
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,850
You're gonna start to page folks.

475
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,980
Let's look how Resolve that works.

476
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,240
So there's kind of two different ways

477
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,290
that Resolve gets triggered.

478
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,790
One is autonomously.

479
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,270
So an alert fires, a web hook
shoots out, or an API call

480
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,830
and Resolve goes to work.

481
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,210
The other is through natural language.

482
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,520
I'm gonna take you through
that in a little bit.

483
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,793
So when this alert fires, it
says the front-end error logs,

484
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,990
it looks like there's really
just front-end error logs,

485
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,750
some labels and so forth.

486
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,220
That's the alert rule.

487
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,800
Now what's interesting
about this alert is,

488
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,240
if you were to investigate this,

489
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,490
the first thing you want us
to do is see that error spike.

490
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,570
And you might wanna look

491
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,940
at what those logs show you on errors,

492
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,590
but this gets a little bit more complex.

493
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,750
This is a nested investigation.

494
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,800
Here you see the findings

495
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,620
that it actually was a dependency service

496
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,680
that was cascading errors
to the front-end, okay?

497
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,330
We check the infrastructure

498
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,130
and we also see that
there was a deployment.

499
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,920
What do you know, change
caused this incident.

500
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,870
Now the hard part about Slack is,

501
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,860
there's context in here,

502
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,180
we wanna make it actionable

503
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,890
so that you can remediate immediately.

504
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,200
If you want, you can create
a PR right from here.

505
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,730
However, when you're in an incident,

506
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,950
you actually want all that
knowledge at your fingertips,

507
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,120
all the data.

508
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,920
And so let's look at the UI

509
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,130
so that you can start to see
the work that Resolve is doing.

510
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,570
And where I want to take you first

511
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,120
is I wanna expose you to how it works.

512
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,920
The reason being is 'cause
then you're gonna start

513
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,940
to get those wheels turning

514
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,100
to see exactly what
you can do with Resolve

515
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,650
and all the entry points for context

516
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,110
to help us understand your systems.

517
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,270
So here's that same alert that fired.

518
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,510
This is just the payload
coming directly from grafana.

519
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,360
But you're gonna start to
see Resolve go to work.

520
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,820
So it's not just like a zero star RCA,

521
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,840
like give us an error

522
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,730
and we're gonna go and troubleshoot it.

523
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,920
What we're doing is
we're relying on explicit

524
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,060
and implicit data.

525
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,890
So we call that knowledge.

526
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,900
We're understanding your system.

527
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,220
So we're building a topology

528
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,020
or an understanding what
we call a knowledge graph.

529
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,700
I'll show you that in a second.

530
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,350
And we're even looking through history,

531
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,820
we're accessing tools.

532
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,150
And so what Resolve does
is it generates a plan.

533
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,910
This a plan is multi-step by nature.

534
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,470
It's gathering evidence.

535
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,110
It knows how to drum up the queries,

536
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,470
it understands rate limits,

537
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,520
it understands the tools,

538
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,950
it knows where the data lives.

539
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,180
And as you can see through here,

540
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,510
it's going through each individual step.

541
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,500
We're looking at logs.

542
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,260
Here, we generate eight
different log queries.

543
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,790
These are very precise log queries,

544
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,040
understanding exactly
what we're looking for.

545
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,650
They don't have to be
generated by the alert itself.

546
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,213
We can generate them ourselves.

547
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,450
Then we start to look at
some of the historicals.

548
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,230
So one big part about AI,
especially in this use case is,

549
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,490
we can have an investigation

550
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,470
that looks beautiful that
we're like, you know what,

551
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,700
we checked all the right things.

552
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,770
It checks out from our experience,

553
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,070
but it still takes humans
to resolving incidents

554
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,450
and providing that feedback

555
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,010
or to be in a part of those channels

556
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,020
where we see the remediation take place

557
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,850
for us to understand if it's good.

558
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,890
So we look at historical investigations,

559
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,840
we create memories from those.

560
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,910
Then we start to look
at some of your traces.

561
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,560
Again, we wanna see where those spans,

562
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
especially in a complex
microservices environment

563
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,150
where those error spans look.

564
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,640
We're gonna look at your logs,
your infrastructure events.

565
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,380
Again, change exists everywhere.

566
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,870
If you just plug this into your code,

567
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,710
you don't actually know

568
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,810
when that PR goes into production or not.

569
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,310
You may know when it's merged.

570
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,070
We look at charts and dashboards.

571
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,330
So a lot of what we have to do

572
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,430
is we have to understand
your observability systems,

573
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,900
not just what's within there,

574
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,420
but how they're used just
like a human would be.

575
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,100
So we're understanding
what are the dashboards

576
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,630
that are commonly used?

577
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,950
What do these dashboards mean?

578
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,270
How are the panels used?

579
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,140
And we allow you to embed
information as well within there.

580
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,350
And now we start to update
the investigation report.

581
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,400
We're looking at the code,

582
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,770
again, like we can have
some great theories

583
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,030
with high confidence,

584
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,670
but without checking the
code to see the intent

585
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,110
behind what happened,

586
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,970
we're not gonna get to causality.

587
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,340
We're still gonna be at
that correlation phase.

588
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,920
And finally we end up here.

589
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,230
So here we've got a working theory.

590
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,180
This working theory, it
does have high confidence.

591
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,610
So this was a cascading event.

592
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,560
Now, one important part about AI,

593
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,050
especially where when
you think about the folks

594
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,390
that are doing this type of
work, incidents themselves,

595
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,610
they pride themselves on
understanding the data,

596
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,680
knowing where to look, what it looks like,

597
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,690
seeing those anomalies firsthand.

598
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,680
And so you have to provide

599
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,620
that same type of information directly.

600
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,840
So we're providing the
logs that we've queried,

601
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,920
we're providing charts,

602
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,480
these are all made on the fly.

603
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,600
So we're not ingesting all
of your observability data

604
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,560
and then acting on this.

605
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,690
We're actually querying it in real time.

606
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,280
We're generating these
queries on ourselves

607
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,070
or using what exists within dashboards.

608
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,150
Now as you go through,

609
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,100
this is where it gets really interesting,

610
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,930
if you're escalated too.

611
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,790
Say you were part of this incident,

612
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,070
you are gonna see a bunch
of different theories.

613
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,150
You're gonna see a bunch of people

614
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,000
that are posting charts
in that Slack channel.

615
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
But the reality is what you want is,

616
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,050
you wanna understand the
timeline of the events.

617
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,130
You want to see how big the impact is

618
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,080
and you wanna understand what
those errors were telling you

619
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,620
because this is where your
intuition is gonna kick in, okay?

620
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,810
And then finally, any recommendations

621
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,620
and any supporting information.

622
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,700
And so as you can imagine,

623
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,530
this seems like a simple incident.

624
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,110
The amount of work that
takes place in people's heads

625
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,650
and the tools that you're using
to get here is overloaded.

626
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,880
So seeing that that is an
incident, we do that all day.

627
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,230
So an alert fires

628
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,210
or an incident channel is spun up,

629
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,770
Resolve goes to work.

630
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,150
Now let's see what we can actually do

631
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,400
with this information as well.

632
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,940
So we've got two different interfaces.

633
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,310
So one of course Slack,
your collaboration tool,

634
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,870
the other one is UI.

635
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,540
Resolve can be triggered
via natural language

636
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,860
because when you think about it,

637
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,700
if you have a question,

638
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,200
you wanna understand
the health of the system

639
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,523
or maybe one of these incidents

640
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:16,710
that actually starts in customer support

641
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,440
where someone's complaining
about errors on the front-end,

642
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,540
you might want to chat
directly with Resolve.

643
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,450
So you can do this directly
outta Slack or within Resolve.

644
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,670
But you know what, let's
take a new use case.

645
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,950
So, "I'm new here.

646
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,950
Tell me about our AWS infrastructure,"

647
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,057
sorry, it helps me to read
out loud while I'm typing

648
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,553
"and services.

649
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,090
Format it in a table,"

650
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,070
because I'm a visual person.

651
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,480
So when you think about

652
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,490
when you've joined your
last engineering role

653
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,080
or when you hire somebody,

654
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,310
chances are you expect them

655
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,870
to ship their first PR in week one.

656
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,940
But that's because you've
created this surface area

657
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,730
of understanding that they
need that's this small.

658
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,130
However, what, how long does
it take for them to go on-call?

659
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,170
It's what, three to four months?

660
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,510
And the reason being is one, it's context.

661
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,150
It's understanding the
complexity of the systems,

662
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,120
but it's also having the confidence

663
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,770
to know that what to do.

664
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,170
Because you know those
runbooks, those SOPs,

665
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,150
they're not kept up to date.

666
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,580
And so here, just within 30 seconds or so,

667
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,080
we've kind of created a wrapper here.

668
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,630
So we'll talk a little bit
about the integrations.

669
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,190
But here what we're doing

670
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,670
is we're essentially using the AWS CLI

671
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,770
to generate all of our
AWS information here.

672
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,110
So we've got EC2 instances,

673
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,110
we've got RDS, MSK and so forth.

674
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,970
Now if I'm new here and I'm curious,

675
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,803
I might wanna say, hey,

676
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:42,873
"Tell me more about RDS.

677
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,630
What services read

678
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,540
and write to it."

679
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,147
Maybe, "Draw a mermaid diagram."

680
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,364
Because those are really in, okay.

681
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:00,180
And so here, what we're gonna do now

682
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,220
is when we need to understand RDS

683
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,990
and we need to know the dependencies,

684
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,460
let's show you how we get there.

685
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,380
So I'm gonna flip over
to the integrations view.

686
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,453
So interestingly enough,

687
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,890
one of the biggest challenges
that we had early on was,

688
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,720
hey, this looks like magic.

689
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,070
But we all know it's not magic.

690
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,870
You still need to connect all the tools

691
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,780
that a human might use to troubleshoot.

692
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,370
And that's absolutely true.

693
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,840
We had to put guardrails in place

694
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,030
just so we went to overstep initially

695
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,860
when we knew we didn't have the right data

696
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,570
that we needed access to.

697
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,250
And so we've got dozens of integrations.

698
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,440
Everything from your
integrations, I'm sorry,

699
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,250
your infrastructure yourself,
observability tools,

700
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,790
unstructured data, even
where tickets are created.

701
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,670
Now, right now you're looking
at this in read-only mode.

702
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,040
But you can imagine if
we can get to an RCA,

703
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,930
why can't we create a Jira ticket?

704
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,890
Why can't we actually daisy
chain or create a PR ourselves?

705
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,600
Okay, so those are the,

706
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,490
those are the integrations themselves.

707
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,370
Now what we do with those integrations

708
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,150
is we build what's
called a knowledge graph.

709
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,550
Now this is my least
favorite part of the product

710
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,890
'cause I think it's hideous
and no one ever uses these,

711
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,630
but everybody wants one.

712
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,510
Here, this is a simple
application, 19 services,

713
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,370
but it's a microservices application.

714
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,530
It's got a lot of dependencies as well.

715
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,320
Now what's interesting about
this is we maintain this

716
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,230
because when you think about
understanding anomalies

717
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,970
or spikes or anything like that,

718
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,030
you actually need a temporal
view of your entire system.

719
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,480
And so we create this on the
fly using these integrations

720
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,150
as well as other contexts that we create.

721
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,490
And that's what we use
for these investigations

722
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,700
as well as to know where to go next, okay.

723
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,050
If we go back into chat,

724
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm actually gonna take you
into one that's completed

725
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,290
just 'cause I know I'm
gonna get kicked off stage.

726
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,290
I did this just right before this session,

727
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,060
but this is the same exact chat.

728
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,400
So here we see the database architecture,

729
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,930
the connected services,

730
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,480
there's our beautiful mermaid diagram.

731
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,560
And fun fact as we never
create any diagrams ourselves

732
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,663
by hand anymore because of this.

733
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,930
Key insights limited database usage,

734
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,270
so only two services are running.

735
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,580
I followed up with
another question though.

736
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,450
I said, you know what?

737
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,160
I wanna know about the health of RDS.

738
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,170
'cause every company I've gone to,

739
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,450
they run into issues with Postgres.

740
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,450
Tell me if see any anomalies or spikes.

741
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,220
So now let's look at what it did.

742
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,560
So it took a look at all
these charts and dashboards.

743
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,290
You can see the queries that it's running.

744
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,340
So it needs to know that hey,

745
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,400
we're going to performance
insights to find this,

746
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,560
we need to look at these dashboards.

747
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,380
And again, every time
I go into an incident

748
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,090
and I click into grafana,

749
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,100
there are about 14 different variables

750
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,500
that I have to select
before I get to what I need,

751
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,240
even if that dashboard is attached.

752
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,560
This does it all for you,

753
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,300
and in parallel.

754
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,430
And here's the report that was published.

755
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,590
So you see key metrics, CPU utilization,

756
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,010
there were some spikes
detected and there's a pattern.

757
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,720
Here are two different
spikes that occurred.

758
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,470
So in the early morning we
see that this is unusual,

759
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,790
so a CPU spiked.

760
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,690
In the evening,

761
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,640
we're seeing a reoccurring daily pattern.

762
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,090
The same pattern observed
in previous days' data.

763
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,920
Here, what we found was
the CPU spike to, wow, 343%

764
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,960
and the right latency was there.

765
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
In fact, it actually automatically went

766
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,580
and root caused it itself.

767
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,350
And so here we see that
there was a resource,

768
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,180
intensive SQL query.

769
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,640
It show, it builds a
chart telling you exactly

770
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,410
what that query resulted in,

771
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,670
why this is problematic.

772
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,700
So again, using the code as well.

773
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,940
And here are the positive
findings, making recommendations.

774
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,770
And so one of the hard parts about this is

775
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,000
not everything is a root cause.

776
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,620
Sometimes you just want us to do a task.

777
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,550
That's what SRE do.

778
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,530
You go into ask engineering at work

779
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,120
because you wanna just understand

780
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,860
why am I getting errors here?

781
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,050
For this one, it decided
to do an investigation

782
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,493
because of these anomalies.

783
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,490
When I asked which service
is making the query

784
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,020
and can you generate it?

785
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,310
Of course it can.

786
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,570
So here, what it's gonna do

787
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,460
is it's gonna investigate the code

788
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,280
to understand where that query came from.

789
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,020
It's gonna find the root cause

790
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,120
and now it's gonna generate that PR.

791
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,700
Creating a PR is as easy as this, okay?

792
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,750
And this is kind of the difference

793
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,910
between cogen tools
and what Resolve offers

794
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,280
is we know what production looks like.

795
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,530
It's not theoretical anymore.

796
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,920
Here are the changes that were
made, the expected impact.

797
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,580
Now using knowledge that's
created within here,

798
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,490
if you want to, you can
actually just enrich

799
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,440
with our resolve markdown file,

800
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
how you wanna interface with Resolve.

801
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,180
So if you want to add any
runbook, any nomenclature,

802
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,970
anything that we can't pick
up from, say your notion,

803
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,360
your Atlassian, then
you can do that as well.

804
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,000
Last night I created a slash command.

805
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,203
Here, what it's doing is it's
formatting a postmortem. Okay?

806
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,210
So this is the power.

807
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,770
This is what an AI SRE should be.

808
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,180
It's really an AI for productions.

809
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,590
It's not about just incidents,

810
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,300
it's what that enables you to do.

811
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,320
Because what we see

812
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,180
is it's more than just engineers

813
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,130
that are on-call using this,

814
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,930
is really every engineer

815
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,330
that has to create, that has to innovate,

816
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,410
that has to write code,

817
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,200
and they want to know
the impact of their code.

818
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,090
So let's jump back into the slides

819
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,783
and we'll talk a little bit
more about how we built this.

820
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,000
So there are really three critical aspects

821
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,233
for what we've built.

822
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,410
The first one is that it understands.

823
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,910
So that knowledge graph, that idea,

824
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,860
so when you think about
like what is a human,

825
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,420
when you look at those principle engineers

826
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,400
and you're like, wow, like we want them

827
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,690
on the most critical project,

828
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,670
what is it about them?

829
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,500
It's they know all the history,

830
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,790
they know how the system works,

831
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,110
they've seen all the fault patterns,

832
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,280
they've read all the postmortems,

833
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,993
they probably wrote 60% of them.

834
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,450
They also have that experience.

835
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,040
So they've learned through the process,

836
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,130
they've seen all the refactors
and been a part of those.

837
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,410
And then they've developed that intuition,

838
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,820
that ability to reason.

839
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,680
When they've given a piece of data,

840
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,780
they kind of know the sniff test.

841
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,220
Resolve has to do the same thing.

842
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,800
So we have to build that
understanding of the system,

843
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,960
but we don't have the luxury of time.

844
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,460
We have to do it through integrations

845
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,620
and what's already available, okay?

846
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,690
And so that's the knowledge graph.

847
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,210
Now learning is where it
gets really interesting

848
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,490
because we're, I'm sure
if you're starting to

849
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,500
or already involved in AI,

850
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,140
you understand the concepts of memory

851
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,940
and even these markdown files

852
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,250
if you're using cursor and so forth.

853
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,200
For us it's a little bit different

854
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
because there's paper trails everywhere

855
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,600
in terms of how people use tools,

856
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,030
meaning like we know the
most common dashboards

857
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,863
that are used.

858
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,730
Why wouldn't we use that
information to understand

859
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,070
how we should navigate your systems?

860
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,330
Or if people are say
everything has a P1 label

861
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,650
within your alerts,

862
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,300
why wouldn't we investigate those

863
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,790
or at least put that as a rubric.

864
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,800
During an incident itself,

865
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,660
if you're going to have a channel

866
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,100
where everybody's working through it

867
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,860
and you're getting all the way
to causality and remediation,

868
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,260
why wouldn't we learn from that?

869
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,030
These are all system interactions.

870
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,580
Additionally, we provide a layer

871
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,650
where you can add your own context

872
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,680
and this context can be
added at a team level,

873
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,690
an organizational level and so forth.

874
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,600
And that's additional
knowledge that we use to inform

875
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,660
how we answer questions
in the tools that we use.

876
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,450
There's always say proprietary information

877
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,370
that you might have that you want to share

878
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,100
so that we can be even more effective.

879
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,440
Now the reasoning piece
is really interesting

880
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,010
because what happens is every
single prompt that you see,

881
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,530
it's really sending a
message to us to say,

882
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,510
hey, go do something with that.

883
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,770
And so we have this planner.

884
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,570
This planner is essentially the brains.

885
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,877
It's saying, okay, given this
prompt, what should we do?

886
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,400
And that prompt can be
a payload from alert,

887
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,250
it can also be natural language.

888
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,870
What it does then is it goes

889
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,620
and it calls these sub-agents
that are specialized agents

890
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,600
to go and gather evidence.

891
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,220
Now they go out.

892
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,980
We have to respect rate
limits, understand the systems,

893
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,150
how they operate,

894
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,010
understand the payloads
that we're gonna return.

895
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,470
We have to process those as as well.

896
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,030
Once it receives that information,

897
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,030
it needs to create additional plans, okay?

898
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,403
So what other evidence,
based on what I saw,

899
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,970
all of that comes out into that response.

900
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,100
But it doesn't typically stop there

901
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,690
because of the feedback loops.

902
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,330
So a lot of the time
there's a human in the loop.

903
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,740
That's what makes it so successful.

904
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,230
And this is part of the
UX that's so difficult

905
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,050
is how do we make sure that a human knows

906
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,820
that this information you can guide,

907
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,680
you can say, hey, last time we heard

908
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,640
there was something over here,

909
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,780
can you go check?

910
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,520
A human doesn't wanna make that check,

911
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,810
but we can do it for you.

912
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,430
And so that's where
the response comes out.

913
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,480
And then we go back through another loop.

914
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,740
Now when we are building resolve,

915
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,190
so back historically when we got started,

916
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,920
the context windows weren't
even large enough for logs.

917
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,040
So a lot of the error logs
where the root cause lived,

918
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,150
we couldn't even process

919
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,490
with foundation bottoms at that time.

920
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,860
So you can imagine how
effective it could be

921
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,480
in getting to root cause.

922
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Now a lot of companies though,

923
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,690
they're starting to dabble with this,

924
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,910
whether it's in a
hackathon or in production,

925
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,090
because this is ripe for disruption.

926
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,270
And this is a pain point that
every engineer lives with,

927
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,760
which is understanding the system,

928
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
having the agency to access the tools

929
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,960
and get access to
knowledge that they need.

930
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,430
And so what a lot of folks do,

931
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,590
and these were those first
like glimmers of hope

932
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,540
is you just take an error that spits out,

933
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,400
you throw it into a foundation model

934
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,020
and you see what comes out.

935
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,230
Now a lot of times those
recommendations are pretty logical.

936
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,270
Sometimes it nails it.

937
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,600
But the reality is that this
doesn't work in complex systems

938
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,110
and pretty much in any system
with any level of reliability

939
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,160
'cause you need the context,

940
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,300
you need to understand the code,

941
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,133
you need to understand

942
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,900
all of these other layers beyond that.

943
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,650
And so what a lot of folks
move to is now with MCP,

944
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,080
interestingly enough, being
in AI, you're always like,

945
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,310
is this an opportunity?

946
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,143
Is this a threat?

947
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,170
What does it mean?

948
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,280
With MCP servers,

949
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,620
what we found is now we
have access to systems

950
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,910
and motivated customers
to build MCP servers

951
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,550
to access data that
wasn't readily available.

952
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,410
Maybe it's legacy systems.

953
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,820
Now the challenge though
with just using LLMs and MCP

954
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,100
is say you run a query
to your observability,

955
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,620
maybe it's natural language
or you say, you know what,

956
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,450
we're getting errors from here.

957
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,280
It can go and process that request.

958
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,930
But what's it gonna do with it?

959
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,810
You kind of need state, you need context.

960
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,370
There's also additional prompting you need

961
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,110
around say handling times

962
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,350
like do I check a one hour or a week?

963
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,460
What happened historically?

964
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,830
How do I know this is anomalous?

965
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,380
However, this can get you
a little bit of value.

966
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Right out of the gate is
just using the MCP servers

967
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,520
that are available,

968
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,070
but it's not gonna get
you to complex problems.

969
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,420
'cause you still have to
understand both the historical

970
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,710
but also the context

971
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,110
as you daisy change
these systems together.

972
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,520
And so what a lot of folks are doing,

973
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,250
especially as foundation
models get even stronger

974
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,590
is they're going to agents.

975
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,720
Now you can build an agent

976
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,700
that understands a lot of context,

977
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,930
it connects to a lot of,

978
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,910
it can make a lot of different NCP calls.

979
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,740
Ideally there's security and governance

980
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,080
within there that you're
taking care of as well.

981
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,240
You also have to build the
user experience for that.

982
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,970
But what ends up happening
is you're putting

983
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,240
so much context into these events

984
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,590
that have happened historically,

985
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,750
meaning like you're
learning from past events

986
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,070
and so you're adding runbooks to it

987
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,230
and you're trying to give
all these directives.

988
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,580
What ends up happening is one,

989
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,380
it becomes bloated, it becomes slow.

990
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,340
But two, it's not prepared
to handle novel incidents

991
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,480
but also novel questions,
prompts it hasn't seen before.

992
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,280
And that's why the single agent approach

993
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,680
really starts to break down.

994
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,020
And then finally, multi-agent systems,

995
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,120
that's where we've ended up.

996
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,030
The challenge here
though is orchestration.

997
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,860
So not only do you need domain expertise

998
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,560
for every single one of these
agents that you produce,

999
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,680
whether it's processing
logs, metrics, code

1000
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,660
for these specific use cases,

1001
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,670
but you also need to
understand rate limits.

1002
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,610
You also need to understand
failure patterns.

1003
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,710
You need to create an eval system.

1004
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,610
Those fail patterns.

1005
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,403
If we don't get results
from say the trace agent,

1006
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,580
how do we reconcile that?

1007
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,800
These are all things
that you have to consider

1008
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,633
when you're building this.

1009
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:09,466
And so the complexity,

1010
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,550
just like moving to microservices did,

1011
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,560
yes, it created a lot of like agility,

1012
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,630
smaller teams, smaller surface areas.

1013
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,250
Everything's API driven.

1014
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,690
But then you have to orchestrate it all.

1015
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,240
And here we are with Kubernetes

1016
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,740
and so we're seeing them all.

1017
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,890
The good news is most companies
have something homegrown

1018
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,120
and usually it's complimentary.

1019
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,570
It's just an input into the
systems, like what we've built.

1020
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,860
So now let's hear about
Coinbase journey into AI SRE

1021
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,660
and what Angelo has been working on.

1022
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,420
- Thank you Josh.

1023
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,760
Imagine it's a Friday afternoon

1024
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,900
and you're trying to unwind for the week

1025
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,180
when all of a sudden you
hear that dreaded sound

1026
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,650
coming from your phone, right?

1027
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,000
You really don't want to hear that,

1028
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,180
but you are on-call, you just got paged.

1029
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,650
There's a problem in production.

1030
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,030
You have to do something,

1031
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,880
you have to get online
and resolve the problem.

1032
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,070
You still don't know
exactly what is wrong.

1033
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,033
You dunno how long it will
take to restore the service.

1034
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,040
It's not great.

1035
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,121
Your boss is even maybe
asking you questions

1036
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:14,253
on chat.

1037
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,560
Anyone familiar with the experience?

1038
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,090
Yeah, raise your hand.

1039
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,610
We have a few. Yeah, okay.

1040
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:28,263
I've seen many of of these
events unfortunately,

1041
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,130
and I'm go and try to
in the next 10 minutes

1042
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,920
to show how we can we have improved

1043
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,023
or we plan to improve this in the future.

1044
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,820
So my name is Angelo.

1045
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,460
I'm a software engineer at Coinbase

1046
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,410
in the infrastructure team

1047
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,470
where we build the foundational components

1048
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,190
on top of which the
products are developed.

1049
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,140
And in my time, I spend a lot of time

1050
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,880
investigating incidents also
preventing them from happening,

1051
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,730
you know, leading the response when

1052
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,403
they inevitably do happen.

1053
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,150
My relationship with the AI,

1054
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,303
initially, was kind of a skeptic, right?

1055
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,580
Until a few years ago,

1056
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,350
I thought like many other people

1057
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,470
that these were just fancy
auto completion tools.

1058
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,420
They're may be helpful
to generate some scripts

1059
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,370
that you would throw away the next day,

1060
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,180
but I was proven wrong actually,

1061
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,460
sometime in 2023 I realized this,

1062
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,653
this is actually much bigger than that.

1063
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,280
I realized that it can
actually help professionals

1064
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,300
build software much faster
at a way greater speed.

1065
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,310
And it can enable
companies to build products

1066
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,830
and iterate really much more quickly.

1067
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,140
So this has an impact on the tech industry

1068
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,600
as a whole, on economy.

1069
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,873
And I believe in even
on society, eventually.

1070
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,263
So I kinda had this moment.

1071
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,891
For those who are not
familiar with Coinbase,

1072
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:05,724
it's a, well,

1073
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:09,780
it's a cryptocurrency
exchange founded in 2012

1074
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,920
that allows more than 120
million people worldwide

1075
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,850
to trade over 40,000 crypto assets.

1076
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,030
And we have a total of almost

1077
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,660
like over half trillion dollars in assets

1078
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,420
that we have on our platform.

1079
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,680
So our system has grown
a lot, scaled a lot.

1080
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,283
And in order to sustain this business,

1081
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:40,080
our infrastructure has also developed,

1082
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,063
grown a lot.

1083
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,990
We went from a Ruby on Rails Monolith,

1084
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,643
that was running just on EC2,

1085
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,310
to a complex network of
thousands of services

1086
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:58,310
deployed on Kubernetes clusters
and on hundreds of them.

1087
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,930
And we have all sorts of data stores

1088
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,633
that for specific use cases.

1089
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,657
Now we have solved one problem,

1090
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:12,172
but there's nothing for free, of course.

1091
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:14,880
Now, it's all much more
complicated to understand.

1092
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,280
No one really understands the full system

1093
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,860
and when things go wrong,

1094
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,353
who can really fix it in a good time,

1095
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,093
in a short time.

1096
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,400
So Coinbase has been a very

1097
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,080
positive in enabling,

1098
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,620
in adopting AI tools since the beginning.

1099
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,453
And that's good.

1100
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:46,430
So now we have all
engineers use some AI tool

1101
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,500
to write code, to review, to summarize,

1102
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,450
to get familiar with new code base.

1103
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,420
There are all sorts of
use cases that help,

1104
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,760
that accelerate the, you know,

1105
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,793
the act of writing software.

1106
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,723
And, this has been,

1107
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,000
our CEO has encouraged internally

1108
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,050
and externally to adopt them.

1109
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:21,050
But their use has been
limited to code only.

1110
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,733
We got to the point

1111
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,810
that writing code is
no longer a bottleneck.

1112
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,860
It's fast.

1113
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,170
It is not the issue anymore.

1114
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,330
And as it happens with software,

1115
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,330
you optimize one function
that is the bottleneck.

1116
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,670
Now, you're gonna see something else

1117
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,560
that becomes the bottleneck.

1118
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,110
Now it's, you are gonna see

1119
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,280
that you spend more time

1120
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,440
maybe waiting for the code review

1121
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,270
or waiting for some approval

1122
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,250
or maybe for the build to finish,

1123
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,920
to deploy or something like that.

1124
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,120
But there's also another thing

1125
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,350
that maybe it's a bit overlooked

1126
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,320
and it's the operations of
the production environment,

1127
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,390
which is now more complex,

1128
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,220
the operations and the debugging

1129
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,883
when it doesn't go as it as expected.

1130
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,217
So that's the topic that we wanted to,

1131
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:13,110
the kind of the question we ask ourselves,

1132
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:17,400
is it possible to use AI for production

1133
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,400
similarly to how we all used
AI tools to generate code?

1134
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:26,149
And to be honest,

1135
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:26,982
I didn't know at the beginning

1136
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:29,640
and now, I can say

1137
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,510
that I'm optimistic about this,

1138
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,220
but you have the right to be skeptic

1139
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,803
as I was a skeptic too in the past.

1140
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,120
So we decided to start with incidents

1141
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,210
because incidents are very time consuming

1142
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,980
and stressful events

1143
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,278
and no one really likes,
but you know, they happen.

1144
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:50,703
We have to deal with them.

1145
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,590
Lots of people,

1146
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,860
lots of engineers get together in a room

1147
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,290
trying to figure out what's the problem.

1148
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,420
There's a cost, there's
an engineering cost,

1149
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,010
there's a context switch

1150
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,840
and also an impact on the business

1151
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,860
because users are probably not happy

1152
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,620
about what happened during an incident.

1153
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,070
Now can we make this faster

1154
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,650
or can we resolve this faster?

1155
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,800
And so we decided to try Resolve

1156
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,260
as a potential tool

1157
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,473
to help us make this a bit less painful.

1158
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,883
And it turns out that it is possible.

1159
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,650
We had some criteria
that we wanted to follow

1160
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,800
some principles that say, okay,

1161
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,360
if we manage to get all these check boxes,

1162
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,243
then we can actually
adopt it in production.

1163
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,860
So we trained the agent
on real life incidents

1164
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,560
that happened in the recent past

1165
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,110
with the real metrics and everything.

1166
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,780
And then compared what is
the answer of the agent

1167
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,910
versus what happened in reality
when engineers were there,

1168
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,113
like trying to debug.

1169
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,780
And then we also simulated the

1170
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,020
like kind of vague prompts.

1171
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,640
We simulated an engineer

1172
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,280
who doesn't have deep domain knowledge

1173
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,893
on whatever was broken.

1174
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,960
So that kind of this
levels up the engineers,

1175
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,270
even if you're not the
expert on service X,

1176
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,310
you can still make some progress

1177
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,833
towards the root cause
by using these tools.

1178
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,210
We found in some cases it
wasn't able to get like,

1179
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,340
deep to the real root cause.

1180
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,920
And almost always it was

1181
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,410
because of missing data,

1182
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,090
it didn't have enough context,

1183
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,363
enough knowledge to get to the root cause.

1184
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,310
So in practice we used
only two data sources,

1185
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,957
Kubernetes and Datadog,

1186
00:47:01,957 --> 00:47:05,160
so Resolve can access, can
see what the pods are up to,

1187
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,800
what, how they evolve over time.

1188
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,280
And they can read metrics,
login traces from Datadog.

1189
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,690
It can do a lot more.

1190
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,590
But these are the only two
that we have integrated so far.

1191
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,560
We also gave you some general knowledge

1192
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,090
and you can see, you can imagine this

1193
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,740
as the knowledge that a new engineer

1194
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,710
acquires in their first week at a company.

1195
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,260
You're learn like all the things that are,

1196
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,810
how to deploy code,

1197
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,890
what are the best practice,

1198
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,410
what are the conventions
we use in this company?

1199
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,440
They're like different
from anyone else, right?

1200
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,380
And then, I mean, the following
weeks as a new engineer,

1201
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,930
you learn about the
team specific knowledge

1202
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:50,910
and this is also what
we talked to the agent.

1203
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:54,000
So we combined data
sources, general knowledge

1204
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,643
and team specific knowledge
or runbooks, right?

1205
00:47:58,154 --> 00:47:59,190
And this really improved

1206
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,283
the performance at the end.

1207
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,390
The performance in terms
of speed was pretty good.

1208
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,510
It was able in most
cases to find root cause

1209
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,720
of a real incident a lot faster

1210
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,720
and have a greater than 50% accuracy,

1211
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,135
which meant it was able to
get to the real root cause.

1212
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:25,630
And as I said before, this can be improved

1213
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,640
by adding more data sources.

1214
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,030
One of the most important
would be the source code.

1215
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,760
As Spiros was mentioning before,

1216
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,890
if you give the agent
access to the source code,

1217
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,250
it can do much deeper analysis.

1218
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,500
It can understand what line of code

1219
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,937
responsible for the problem

1220
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:48,783
and maybe even suggest
a fix, potential PR.

1221
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,660
I have two example incidents.

1222
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,400
We're almost at a time.

1223
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,490
But this is an example of incident,

1224
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,980
just a screenshot from the Resolve

1225
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,980
where this was caused by
a badly tuned load test.

1226
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:13,530
We constantly load test
our services in production

1227
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,530
to make sure that they can scale anytime

1228
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,630
to respond to volatility events.

1229
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:23,460
And in this case, one
endpoint was hit really badly,

1230
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,080
very slow test.

1231
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,120
Resolve was able to traverse

1232
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,410
the dependency graph of our services

1233
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,890
and get to the service that was suffering,

1234
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,110
had like very high CPU utilization.

1235
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,750
It reached all the HPA limits

1236
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,720
and also was aware that
there was a load test

1237
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,810
because we taught the agent the concept

1238
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,180
of load test at Coinbase,

1239
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,940
which is different from
other organizations,

1240
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,940
like it's very specific to organization.

1241
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:00,482
A second one

1242
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,250
was caused by an out of memory
error in a sidecar container.

1243
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,220
Again, this was like deep into the

1244
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,870
service dependency graph,

1245
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,590
from outside it looked
like there were, like,

1246
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,390
tens of different endpoints

1247
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,030
that were affected were
failing with five hundreds.

1248
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,883
But it was kinda hard to get to the,

1249
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,100
to get to the root cause.

1250
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,620
And all the services that were failing,

1251
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,370
they all had in common
this sidecar container

1252
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,920
that was running out of memory.

1253
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,190
Resolve was able to
find that in 12 minutes.

1254
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,620
However, due to the limitation,

1255
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,240
because it cannot access the source code,

1256
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,220
it cannot know why, right?

1257
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,480
And that had to be done,

1258
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,430
that has to be done manually right now.

1259
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,783
Okay, so how do we use Resolve today?

1260
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,100
We basically do invoke it manually

1261
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:03,210
on a chat bot interface

1262
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,300
or from Slack as you saw before.

1263
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,730
But in the future we are gonna use it

1264
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:12,120
and other investigation also
whenever there's an alert.

1265
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,510
But in the future, I
hope we can integrate it

1266
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,973
so that it can propose
remediation actually.

1267
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,680
And you know, in the future,
in the next few years,

1268
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,120
I expect that these agents will become

1269
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,530
more kind of, more autonomous,

1270
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,810
will give them a bit more freedom

1271
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:33,120
to operate and to suggest

1272
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,000
and even make changes to our environments.

1273
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,750
And we'll see that as
a kind of natural thing

1274
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,170
that now seems a bit something
that we wouldn't trust.

1275
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,520
Like I wasn't trusting,

1276
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,000
in the past, I wasn't trusting
an AI tool to write code,

1277
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,550
but then I realized it was
a good idea to trust it.

1278
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,430
I think we're probably
gonna see something similar,

1279
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,973
a similar shift in two
or three years from now.

1280
00:51:58,576 --> 00:52:00,600
And with that,

1281
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,410
I am done.

1282
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:08,670
If you are interested in
knowing about Coinbase,

1283
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,670
you can check out this link
or you wanna chat with me.

1284
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:16,540
You can find me, you
know, here or on LinkedIn

1285
00:52:17,563 --> 00:52:18,900
and (faintly speaks).

1286
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,800
- So anybody,

1287
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,840
Angelo is one of my
favorite people to work with

1288
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,190
'cause he's obviously very thorough

1289
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,840
of very extremely high bar

1290
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,240
and, you know, getting past that bar,

1291
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,370
I mean his bar, of course,
in the Coinbase bar

1292
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,540
makes me extremely happy.

1293
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,310
And you know, what we managed to achieve,

1294
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,357
of course with Coinbase both past the bar,

1295
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:37,590
let's say of like very
high quality engineers,

1296
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,020
obviously that, you know,
wouldn't, like, use a tool

1297
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,860
unless it's very effective,

1298
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,420
but also very high compliance

1299
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,583
and security environment at the same time.

1300
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,273
I have two questions.

1301
00:52:47,273 --> 00:52:48,106
A year ago, actually,

1302
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:49,620
it was the first time I gave a demo,

1303
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,260
it was I think maybe
around reinvent to Coinbase

1304
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,780
and the reaction was, oh,
this looks very useful,

1305
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,700
but we'll never use AI
in production, I guess,

1306
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,020
or an AI tool like this.

1307
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,570
What changed over the past one year?

1308
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,670
- I guess never say never, right?

1309
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,470
Because that's the same thing

1310
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,730
I would think, you know,

1311
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,700
three years ago I wouldn't let a AI agent

1312
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,810
to write code for me.

1313
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,960
They didn't know how to write
code, but they actually do.

1314
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,313
So what changed?

1315
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,780
Maybe we had that red pill moment

1316
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,700
that we realized this
has a very high potential

1317
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,700
and security is obviously paramount.

1318
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,350
It's very important.

1319
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,500
We cannot compromise on that.

1320
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,510
But once you understand the system,

1321
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,607
you understand what it can do.

1322
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:39,270
You can put guardrails right on the agent,

1323
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,710
so you know it's not gonna do
anything that is not allowed.

1324
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,800
Yeah, so I guess we've spent
a lot of time together,

1325
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,300
- Correct. Correct.
- Yeah.

1326
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,730
- By the way, and the
other question I have is,

1327
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:51,563
you made the prediction, all right,

1328
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:53,310
you said you were skeptic, you know,

1329
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,360
you started believing in code,

1330
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,850
you started believing now
in agents for production.

1331
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,390
If your prediction goes wrong,
how's it gonna go wrong?

1332
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,450
- I think it will go wrong
in probably in many ways,

1333
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,060
it is very hard to predict what-

1334
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,420
- In what direction,
going wrong direction.

1335
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,910
- But again, if it's wrong, my prediction,

1336
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,890
my meta prediction is also
going to be wrong too.

1337
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:18,890
I don't know, I think it'll
be, maybe it's low adoption,

1338
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,853
so not everyone will get on
board, you know, quickly.

1339
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,710
So maybe a few in companies or sectors,

1340
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,863
or will take a little longer to adopt.

1341
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,973
But maybe this is the
way it will be wrong.

1342
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,620
But in general, I think
they will take the stage

1343
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,517
and free up some time from SREs

1344
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:45,630
- Thank you
- our own happiness.

1345
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,860
- Thanks for trusting us by the way.

1346
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,203
And thanks for the sharing all this data.

1347
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,110
I have my own predictions by the way,

1348
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:56,130
and I've now worked in it
with agents for so long

1349
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,200
that I'll give them to you in a minute.

1350
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,540
But maybe to kind of summarize

1351
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,790
in a way what we believe

1352
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,590
or what may be the key takeaways.

1353
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:08,040
I think that I truly believe
the impact of AI in production

1354
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,450
is gonna be more than code.

1355
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,910
Because yes, we can
generate maybe 80% of code,

1356
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,370
but that hasn't allowed us
to move five times faster.

1357
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,710
Once we manage to apply the same concepts

1358
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,760
and the same reasoning abilities,

1359
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,110
let's say crucial production,

1360
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,460
and that's what the Resolve does,

1361
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,650
we'll see that actually our
lives are gonna become easier

1362
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,720
and gonna be able to move a lot faster.

1363
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,220
Now that's not an easy problem, right,

1364
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,420
like Josh showed and,

1365
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,640
like Angelo described about,

1366
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,320
you cannot build agents that you know,

1367
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,080
maybe like an LLM on top of logs, right,

1368
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,530
or on top of metrics.

1369
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,630
These agents have to operate
these tools as a human

1370
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,463
and they have to understand

1371
00:55:37,463 --> 00:55:38,850
the context of the entire system,

1372
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,653
the way human would to be effective.

1373
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,720
And finally the issuing
abilities of the agents.

1374
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,710
And we're getting there, right?

1375
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,730
The models are getting better.

1376
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,980
The agents who are building
are becoming more effective,

1377
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,470
have to be almost on
par with humans, right?

1378
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,900
And sometimes they have to
be more effective, right?

1379
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,180
I always compare the adoption of agents

1380
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,313
in software or production

1381
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,570
similar to maybe self-driving cars.

1382
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,130
You know, we don't trust self-driving cars

1383
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,360
if they're as good as humans, right?

1384
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,310
They have to be safer than humans

1385
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,020
to allow them to drive on the streets.

1386
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,210
And I think the same is true for agents.

1387
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,400
But, and I think we're getting there

1388
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,190
and you know, if you ask me

1389
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,240
what are my predictions about the future,

1390
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,370
I think we're in an exponential
curve of improvement.

1391
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,510
And the reason, by the way,

1392
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,340
I asked Angelo about his prediction,

1393
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,760
'cause I think most of us get
it wrong in the direction of,

1394
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,080
we kind of extrapolate

1395
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,670
based on what we've seen in the past.

1396
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,887
And we're actually
maybe not, we don't see,

1397
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:34,590
we're not as aggressive in our prediction

1398
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,570
because we, it's hard for humans to see

1399
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,670
what happens in an exponential curve.

1400
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,770
I do think that
productivity gains from AI,

1401
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:44,010
we'll exceed any other
technology that happened so far.

1402
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,510
And actually will be in many ways,

1403
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,580
maybe a solution out of
many problems we have,

1404
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,900
as humanity even.

1405
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,310
I do think that, you know,

1406
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,160
more specifically when it comes
to software and technology,

1407
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,930
I believe agents will be actually

1408
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,120
doing more and more work today.

1409
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,680
You know, the way Angelo was describing,

1410
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,770
maybe agents respond to humans
or get triggered by an alert,

1411
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,900
but I think they will start
working like, you know,

1412
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,240
24/7 without actually complaining,

1413
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,650
taking longer and longer tasks,

1414
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,970
using more and more reasoning.

1415
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,760
And then let's say a lot
more like this tedious,

1416
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,860
laborious kind of effort into tokens

1417
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,570
and, you know, delivering outcomes

1418
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:18,990
and, you know, getting
essentially humans to operate.

1419
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,194
And I think we're getting there,

1420
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:21,360
at a high level of abstraction.

1421
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,280
So in my view of all this

1422
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,740
is that it's not like agents
are gonna take the work

1423
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,640
of software engineers,

1424
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,990
it's just that we're gonna be producing

1425
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,607
like 10, a hundred times more technology.

1426
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:32,700
And I think that's a
great thing for the world.

1427
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,110
And with that, you know,
thanks for attending,

1428
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,030
you can actually go and
use the Resolve today.

1429
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,310
So if you scan that this QR code here,

1430
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,980
it takes you to, you know, a signup page.

1431
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,450
You can connect your tools if you want,

1432
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,590
but there is also a sandbox

1433
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,630
that you can play with right away.

1434
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,670
And you can go into a
sandbox, play with it,

1435
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,800
and go back and connect
your own tools, right?

1436
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,170
And this is like our
preview of our, you know,

1437
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,460
fully self-service product.

1438
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,930
We can use it for free.

1439
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,703
And if you like it, we'll
happy to talk to you more.
