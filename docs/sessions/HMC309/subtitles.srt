1
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:07,788
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:10,198
This is the session

3
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,179
AMC 309.

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,909
Migrating your VMware workloads with on-premises

5
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:16,609
dependencies.

6
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,059
And if you came here today to learn

7
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,280
how AWS.

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,958
Design a set of services to help

9
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,420
you to migrate and modernize

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,600
from VMware.

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,728
Through the clouds at your own pace,

12
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:32,340
you're in the right place.

13
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:35,959
Today I'm sharing the stage with

14
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,618
my good friend Scott Rose.

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,649
And our guest.

16
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:41,429
Travis

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:42,728
McVeigh

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,689
from Caesars Entertainment.

19
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,020
All right, this is our agenda for today.

20
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,569
And without any further ado,

21
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,098
let's get into the good stuff.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,240
Good I've

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,779
been in this situation before.

24
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,090
And if you are a professional,

25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,019
Working on

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,879
Traditional infrastructure on premise,

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,278
you can probably relate to those challenges.

28
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,588
And if you do, I can feel your

29
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,879
pain. I've been there for several

30
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,540
years

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,879
and plenty of time, and

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,680
I can tell you.

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,558
I know it's very, very hard and

34
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:23,980
it's very, very difficult.

35
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,418
Whenever we are talking about

36
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,540
administering and running on premises

37
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,319
infrastructure.

38
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,099
I would like to

39
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,849
Ask you guys a question.

40
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,198
Is there still

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:39,918
Worry

42
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:41,609
To run

43
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,069
on premises infrastructure.

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,569
That is still a good thing. There is still a

45
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:48,760
valid approach.

46
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,308
Well, As it

47
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,040
turns out,

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,379
It's very, very difficult.

49
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,198
To actually get a good grasp

50
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,569
of the TCO

51
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:03,000
of running on-premises infrastructure.

52
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,838
Particularly on some aspects

53
00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:08,618
like personnel.

54
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,550
The cost of running infrastructure.

55
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,788
The cost of the facilities.

56
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,319
And the technical debt

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,500
that we accumulate over time.

58
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:22,419
It's very difficult to get a good estimate.

59
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,189
And if you don't know how it actually costs,

60
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,610
it's very difficult to make informed

61
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,649
decisions about if it's still worthy

62
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,569
to run on on-prem infrastructure.

63
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:35,169
Or

64
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,758
should I take a different path?

65
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,528
Over time,

66
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:44,719
We have this compound effect.

67
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,210
Of the business drivers

68
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,169
and the technical drivers

69
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:50,699
to actually push.

70
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,050
The idea of migrating

71
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,569
our infrastructure.

72
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,338
Through the cloud

73
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,639
And with that

74
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,159
compound force

75
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:04,929
we can actually

76
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,199
Make an informal decision on

77
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,080
should I go or not.

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,639
Is it worthwhile?

79
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:14,349
Should I go all in?

80
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:18,169
What is the best strategy and etc.

81
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,288
for me

82
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,770
to actually go

83
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:24,338
and. Start this journey.

84
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,258
Whenever you think of this,

85
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,360
of course,

86
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,819
there are some challenges that

87
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,960
you encounter,

88
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:34,080
and of course that will come to your mind.

89
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,389
The first one is that

90
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,610
How long does it take to migrate?

91
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:41,580
Is that easy?

92
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:44,719
Should I do it at a fast pace or

93
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,939
should I take it slow?

94
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,819
And if I take it slow,

95
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,770
how can I demonstrate

96
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,308
that I am generating value out of it?

97
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:55,058
How can I demonstrate, oh, we are already

98
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,860
uh. Taken

99
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,069
to the hanging low hanging fruit

100
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:01,629
and to our leadership,

101
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,189
oh, is it good? We are making good progress,

102
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,169
and this is good.

103
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,819
The next challenge is

104
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,219
As of lately

105
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,639
we are having an

106
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,439
ever growing pressure.

107
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,209
About sovereignty.

108
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,158
We still have to

109
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,478
keep our data.

110
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:26,389
On premises

111
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,619
We have regulatory requirements.

112
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,910
We have government mandates.

113
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,819
And they say I want to control the

114
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:36,678
facility

115
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,230
where my data

116
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,160
lives.

117
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,199
This is one more argument because

118
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:45,319
There's a

119
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,230
huge chance that

120
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,350
you don't have a region nearby

121
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,428
and you cannot say oh the region is in my country

122
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,928
or eventually have a local zone in

123
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,569
your country.

124
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,170
So you need

125
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,230
A strategy

126
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,209
whenever you are being audit

127
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:06,108
for one of these government bodies

128
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:07,369
say OK

129
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,790
how are you handling

130
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,588
my data sovereignty requirements.

131
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,160
Not to mention, and I bet that you

132
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,579
heard a lot.

133
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,009
This

134
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,889
Last days about Gen AI.

135
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,209
All of a lot of customers

136
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,269
that I deal with

137
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,709
are always asking us.

138
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,790
How can I run

139
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:31,879
A G AI

140
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:33,838
augmented application.

141
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:35,819
On-prem

142
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,329
How can I run inference on prem?

143
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,608
From my data sets.

144
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:44,790
And still meet

145
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:45,910
my

146
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:46,988
data

147
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:48,689
sovereignty requirements.

148
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,879
These challenges

149
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:54,319
are imposing

150
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,399
a great pressure

151
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,399
on

152
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,309
the movement to migrate

153
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,439
from on premises

154
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:03,540
to the cloud.

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,939
And now

156
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,220
you're probably

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,259
thinking

158
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:10,220
how AWS can help me

159
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,778
on that intent.

160
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,988
AWS

161
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:19,379
has designed a strategy.

162
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,559
To help our customers

163
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,928
to migrate.

164
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,439
At their own pace

165
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,220
from on prem.

166
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,838
To the ideally

167
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,269
to the cloud region.

168
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,069
But if not possible at first,

169
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:37,949
we can give you

170
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,709
steps along the way.

171
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,199
We can give you a journey

172
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,459
so you can.

173
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,160
Migrate

174
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:46,838
You can.

175
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,329
Meet your requirements.

176
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:52,730
You can tackle those challenges that

177
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:53,949
we just saw.

178
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,389
And you are, you can

179
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,709
Quickly demonstrate

180
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:00,980
that you are

181
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,108
living that traditional world,

182
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,670
and then you are stepping into

183
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,928
the clouds.

184
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,189
This strategy is what we call

185
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:11,889
AWS

186
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,129
where you need it.

187
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,608
And it's a set of services that allow you

188
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,209
To migrate

189
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:21,928
from your own premise.

190
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,689
To either

191
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,410
AWS outpost,

192
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,869
which is very, very close to you.

193
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,199
AWS outputs can be placed on your

194
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,939
data center.

195
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:36,329
It can be placed on a call facility

196
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,528
of your choice.

197
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:39,829
And that's

198
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,889
the closest that we can get.

199
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,988
With AWS services.

200
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,608
Or

201
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,129
you can take the step of migrating to a

202
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:50,879
local zone.

203
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:54,230
A local zone is our infrastructure place

204
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,488
it on.

205
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,858
Metropolitan areas, selected metropolitan

206
00:07:58,858 --> 00:07:59,559
areas.

207
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:01,389
And it's also

208
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,819
A valid path for you

209
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,678
to address

210
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,480
sovereignty requirements.

211
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,670
Because AWS

212
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,290
can sure can guarantee to you that our

213
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,309
infrastructure, it's running

214
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,600
at that metropolitan area.

215
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,338
And this might be enough

216
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,579
for a lot of governments and entities

217
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,278
that require data residency.

218
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,889
With that

219
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,920
We can create a journey.

220
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,359
So you should always be aiming

221
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,000
to get to the region whenever possible,

222
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,678
but if not,

223
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:40,827
We can give you

224
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,408
Steps along the way

225
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,889
where you are effectively running.

226
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:48,509
On AWS

227
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,969
On a cloud infrastructure.

228
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,200
Cloud assets that are futureproof

229
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,359
and that can pave the way

230
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,849
for you. To finally

231
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,168
migrate as much as possible

232
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:03,830
from your own premises.

233
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:05,389
Through the cloud.

234
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,038
There are several ways for you,

235
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,058
several paths.

236
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,788
That you can take

237
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:16,389
To actually

238
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:18,808
Endured this journey

239
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,058
Of course, the most common one

240
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:23,719
is the lift and shift approach.

241
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,440
In which our customers

242
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,080
want to just

243
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,619
show very quick results.

244
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,460
And they just take the workloads as they

245
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,369
are. And they migrate

246
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:37,918
either to outposts or local zones.

247
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:41,029
And this is totally fine. This is

248
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:42,029
absolutely fine.

249
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,149
What you could do

250
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,928
is along the way.

251
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,889
Try to modernize and try

252
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,700
to shift gears a little bit,

253
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,469
experiencing some some of our

254
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,190
managed services

255
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,830
like managed databases,

256
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,830
like managed containers.

257
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,129
So you don't need to install your database

258
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:07,428
on top of VC 2 anymore.

259
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:10,950
You don't need to manage your Kubernetes

260
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,928
or your Docker.

261
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,859
And you can leverage our offerings

262
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,418
that will certainly

263
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,109
Alleviate

264
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,119
What we call the undifferentiated

265
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:23,178
heavy lifting.

266
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,239
Which is those activities that

267
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,759
are fundamental

268
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,678
but does not bring

269
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,408
too much added value.

270
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,869
Whenever you are choosing

271
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,369
which route to take.

272
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,908
It's important to factor in.

273
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,769
The timelines of your migration.

274
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,529
What kind of requirements do you have?

275
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,259
If you are running out of contract with

276
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,158
facilities,

277
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,960
if you have outdated hardware,

278
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,158
if you are expiring contracts

279
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:59,239
and warranties.

280
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:03,009
And this is really, really important for you.

281
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,668
To decide

282
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:06,908
which one to take.

283
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,950
But the best course of action is

284
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,529
to take action now.

285
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:13,619
Don't wait.

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,899
That's what we are here for,

287
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,219
to help you

288
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,538
to finally

289
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,139
make that decision,

290
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,759
and we are here to help you.

291
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,320
To make that happen.

292
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,678
I'll hand it over to you, Scott, my good

293
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:30,519
friend. Scott.

294
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,349
All right, thanks so much, Frankie.

295
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,788
Hi folks, my name is Scott Rose, colleague

296
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:36,840
with Frankie, been with AWS for a little

297
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,849
over 5 years, and really, really excited

298
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:41,239
to be speaking about how we've helped many

299
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,219
customers such as yourselves

300
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,639
assess, optimize, and migrate their

301
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,979
workloads over to AWS and specifically

302
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,460
how to do that into our hybrid edge port.

303
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,974
on-prem portfolio outpost

304
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:55,094
in local zones we've been doing it for the

305
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,173
better part of 5 years, almost since Outpost

306
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,163
was originally launched,

307
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,455
and we're really excited to have Travis here from

308
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,413
Caesars to talk about his journey.

309
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,884
Caesars was one of the original customers

310
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:07,075
that deployed Outpost. You'll have some great context

311
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:08,433
coming from him as well.

312
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,879
Now here at AWS and you guys have all been in a bunch of

313
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,158
sessions. We threw a lot of tech at you

314
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,389
and we're going to do that here in a moment as well, but

315
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,580
we also want to talk about the commercials because

316
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,849
when we deal with migration

317
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:22,070
situations we're typically dealing with environments

318
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,229
that are 1020,

319
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,979
sometimes 30 years old.

320
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,668
We're starting to see some

321
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:30,070
interesting licensing cost changes. Obviously VMware

322
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,690
is one of them,

323
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,590
but also the cost in

324
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,840
operating and maintaining extremely old.

325
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:38,219
Legacy environments such as mainframe environments

326
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,969
and it has become extremely difficult for these

327
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:41,580
organizations

328
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,038
to continue to fund and continue to budget

329
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,229
operations that were designed essentially decades

330
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,700
ago, not to mention most of the expertise

331
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,918
or those workloads themselves are just nowhere

332
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,038
clear optimized for current

333
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,190
product and application requirements. So we're

334
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,139
seeing the cost elements become

335
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
a very important consideration, of course,

336
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,979
in addition to the technical one.

337
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,418
So with that said,

338
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,019
AWS over the last 6 to 9 months

339
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,460
has really spent a lot of time helping

340
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
out the funding situation,

341
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,558
the migration

342
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,580
compensation situation I'll call it, in

343
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,820
that we want to make sure when you're analyzing

344
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,298
this, don't worry about

345
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,460
any kind of duplicate licensing costs, double

346
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,000
bubble type

347
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,979
situations. We will have a migration

348
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:29,354
program and a suitable. Funding

349
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,504
program to help alleviate most if

350
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,673
not all of those costs and both Frankie and

351
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:36,183
myself have been involved in some fairly large customers.

352
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,514
When we calculated up the size of

353
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:40,875
those funding programs, they are quite

354
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,033
significant. So don't be afraid to bring those

355
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,033
commercial concerns to us well

356
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,114
in advance of the technical and

357
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:48,014
the architectural

358
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:51,134
analysis that obviously is going to be happening in parallel

359
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,553
for your migration assessment.

360
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,029
So there's a lot of ways to approach this from

361
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,288
a financial standpoint. We can do this

362
00:13:57,658 --> 00:14:00,009
in the form of credits towards our

363
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:02,269
ProServe organization, working to

364
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:04,570
scope those projects again

365
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,590
in a sequence and in a dollar

366
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,599
amount that makes sense.

367
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:09,950
We have a lot of partners that are involved in this as well.

368
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:12,629
Most of our customers are

369
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,940
engaged with multiple system integrators

370
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:17,090
that have been contracted to do

371
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,908
application management and operations.

372
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:20,893
For many years,

373
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:23,533
so our funding programs are designed to also

374
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,533
work directly from

375
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,871
a commercial standpoint

376
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:29,263
into those partners themselves. And

377
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:31,533
then again, looking at this from a going

378
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,572
forward standpoint, obviously AWS

379
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,602
is cloud computing. It's based on a consumption

380
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:38,251
model. A lot of your on-prem infra

381
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,111
might still be

382
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,871
purchased and budgeted from a CE

383
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,893
standpoint, so we try to bridge those

384
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:45,932
two. The net net is that if you're

385
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,035
doing a migration program. With AWS,

386
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:50,556
we're looking forward from a standpoint of

387
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,634
how that estate is going to look on running

388
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:55,065
on cloud native infra, in this case cloud

389
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,275
native infra on-prem, such as with outposts

390
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,754
and local zones, and to negate out

391
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,875
any kind of duplicate costs that

392
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,105
you might be calculating so you can be assured

393
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,466
you can move forward and it's a single layer

394
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,556
cost, not multiple layers, because you're going

395
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,475
from one platform,

396
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:11,995
say VMware or an older

397
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,014
set of infrastructure over to AWS.

398
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,840
OK, so as we move forward, Frankie had

399
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,869
a, you know, a bit of a complicated, uh, or just,

400
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,000
you know, fairly uh text heavy

401
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,080
slide on, on the various migration steps, and

402
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,320
it really just consolidates down to this.

403
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,859
Um, it's a fairly simple

404
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,119
staging or sequencing as far as how

405
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,320
we want to look at your state, what

406
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,668
we want to do from a standpoint of

407
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,719
moving legacy applications or legacy

408
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,750
VMs over onto the proper

409
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,960
AWS footprint.

410
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,099
Obviously the bottom of the layer is the very

411
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,719
fast but also very useful EC2

412
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,719
lift and shift and then simply moving up the

413
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,418
scale.

414
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,558
Some customers want to modernize those

415
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,668
virtual applications, those virtual machines into

416
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:54,389
containers.

417
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,000
Maybe we want to move a step forward, add

418
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,239
managed database services such as RDS,

419
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,940
or take the final leap where we're completely

420
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,119
refactoring some of those applications and

421
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,178
going, say with

422
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,359
a fully serverless deployment.

423
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,889
Of course we can do all this, we've been doing all this for

424
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:10,830
quite some time.

425
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:12,869
My experience

426
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,649
with migration customers and we've been doing

427
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,009
many over the past 3 to 4 years and that

428
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,389
that that uh speed has been picking up. It's

429
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,460
not a one-stop shop.

430
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,928
Many of these environments we're doing,

431
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,269
say, a canvas of the environment first

432
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,450
with the lift and shift, and then there's a fraction

433
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,450
that gets containerized

434
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,908
and a further fraction where we're deploying

435
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,048
database managed services. So it's not just

436
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:37,308
a one blob, it's several different layers

437
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:38,090
of this cake.

438
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:39,649
And then just to strike

439
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:40,750
the on-prem.

440
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:43,210
Versus the regional element with outposts

441
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,479
with local zones,

442
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,519
we can typically take it all the way up into the managed

443
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,048
database services and then region

444
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:53,239
is of course where you'll find our scalable

445
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,330
serverless platform such as

446
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,529
Lambi. So again, just a little bit of context

447
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,389
and cut through from the standpoint of the

448
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,389
slide that Frankie showed a bit earlier.

449
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,039
Now earlier last year

450
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,209
we launched our 2nd generation outpost,

451
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:08,439
and we're talking about this because a lot of our

452
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,759
VMware migration opportunities are

453
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,699
coming at us

454
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,239
with hard requirements to stay on-prem. They

455
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,239
want to deploy with cloud native infra, obviously

456
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,439
leveraging AWS,

457
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,979
but not into the region, has to stay on-prem

458
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:22,439
for a variety of reasons data residency,

459
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,479
latency,

460
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,009
proximity to other on-prem assets,

461
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:27,880
say, other storage or other compute assets.

462
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,577
And so our infra basically has to sit

463
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,739
adjacent to those existing

464
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:35,479
solutions. So that's what Outpost was specifically

465
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,077
built for.

466
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,878
The second gen Outpost came out mid

467
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:40,259
early last year,

468
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,519
this year 2025, and we've been scaling it

469
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,628
up over the last 6 to 9

470
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,458
months. And this has been working out

471
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,218
amazingly for our migration

472
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,519
opportunities, our customers with migration

473
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,239
use cases.

474
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:56,118
Why? Because many of those environments

475
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,209
that we are analyzing, we're going in and we're

476
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:58,809
seeing

477
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,568
tens and tens of thousands

478
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:03,608
of these CPUs, hundreds

479
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,900
of terabytes, sometimes into the petabyte

480
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,328
type storage range,

481
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:09,910
so the kind of scale that's needed

482
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:12,289
to migrate those workloads over

483
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,509
to an AWS outpost

484
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,858
footprint can be quite significant.

485
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,848
So with the new

486
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,259
High compute density EC2

487
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:22,719
instances that were launched with OutpostG 2

488
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,118
are parallel networking substructure

489
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:26,598
which doesn't just help

490
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,959
say high IO data center applications and databases,

491
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,459
but also some of our customers want to multiplex

492
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,769
other workloads on them,

493
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,640
network intensive workloads.

494
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,078
OutpostGen 2 serves as a very,

495
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,568
very solid. Footprint for both the standard

496
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,588
IT applications coming over

497
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,750
from VMware as well as perhaps some

498
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,949
high performance databases and other

499
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,029
suitable applications and categories

500
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,608
of applications, and those all can be multiplexed

501
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:54,868
on the same rack infrastructure. And

502
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,068
so what we're talking about here is we're talking

503
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:59,630
about customers who are ripping up

504
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,709
extremely large fleets of legacy

505
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,759
infra. A lot of it running VMware, a lot of it

506
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,838
running throughout multiple sites and

507
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,500
consolidating a lot of that down onto

508
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,000
outpost rack footprints, sometimes

509
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,358
in the dozens and sometimes in the hundreds

510
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:14,439
of rack size,

511
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,759
but that footprint turns out to be

512
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,420
a lot smaller and a lot more efficient

513
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,539
than what that legacy infrastructure footprint

514
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:24,039
looked like prior to getting on with the

515
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,368
project itself. So as I mentioned, the

516
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:28,598
new instances that came with outpost

517
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:29,630
2,

518
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,180
from a stand, most importantly from a standpoint of

519
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,269
the CPU and the memory density

520
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,699
gave us very, very good metrics

521
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,890
to go and calculate and create much

522
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,328
more dense configurations than was

523
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,239
currently deployed

524
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:44,828
with the previous Edge Infra.

525
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,219
We also have a set of other

526
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,380
instances in this outpost such as bare metal which

527
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,358
was designed for some of our

528
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:55,380
very high performance application customers

529
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,598
such as in our Finserve

530
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:59,140
segment as well as in our telco segment

531
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,689
and then coming soon we'll have a next

532
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,818
generation GPU instance, not

533
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,930
just for graphics instances of course. This will

534
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,199
be a GPU instance specifically designed

535
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:08,724
for. Or

536
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,546
at the edge inference and perhaps even training

537
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,655
as well depending on how you're setting up

538
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,905
your models. So this rack

539
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:19,165
has been built forward proof from a standpoint

540
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,984
of the type of workloads that our customers

541
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:24,026
need for the next several years, and

542
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,066
some of these are just in the design phases. So we want

543
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,144
to make sure we're skating to where the

544
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,265
puck needs to be from an aspect of your

545
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:33,250
on-prem requirements. And the migration

546
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,391
situation as we're specifically talking about in this

547
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:37,750
session has really, really

548
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,832
pushed the limits of the next generation

549
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:42,102
densities that are on these outposts,

550
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:44,151
and what's not even being shown here is in

551
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,490
about a couple of months we'll have yet another wave

552
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,030
of brand new, brand new, even higher

553
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,171
performing instances that AWS

554
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:52,381
will be launching. So

555
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:54,770
stick around for details on that.

556
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:57,318
Coming back to the migration and coming back to

557
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:59,489
the VMware story in a second, what we've seen

558
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,670
with customers who are actively doing this today,

559
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,549
we've all been in these enterprise

560
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,630
IT environments for quite some time throughout our careers,

561
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,979
and you think we got it. You think that

562
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,500
this should take maybe a couple of weeks to assess.

563
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,750
It's not. This is taking months.

564
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:16,219
Some of our customers are taking years because

565
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:18,269
What we're discovering is a lot of these environments

566
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,348
have basically sat there and they haven't

567
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,549
been optimized. They haven't really been

568
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,549
updated other than, say, operating system

569
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,630
and firmware, so the architecture

570
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,000
doesn't make sense. Like a specific example,

571
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:30,118
we'll go into

572
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,469
the VM disk manifest and we'll

573
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:34,848
see VMs where there might be one CPU

574
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,229
and 700 gigabytes, 760.

575
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,670
Gigabytes of memory, a very asymmetrical VM,

576
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,068
and we try to find out what was that used for and

577
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,969
do we need to find a suitable EC2 instance to house that

578
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:48,108
and no one in the organization seems to know where that comes

579
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,489
from. So when you do that at scale

580
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:53,068
and you go through this with hundreds and thousands

581
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,588
and tens of thousands of VMs, really

582
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:56,130
the time

583
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,269
to do all that really, really creeps up.

584
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:00,769
So how are we solving that? How are we

585
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,868
correcting that? How are we creating a better

586
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:04,519
assess and optimize plan?

587
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:07,009
Well, of course we have been analyzing this,

588
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,368
and our solution, of course, is going to be a set

589
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:12,088
of agentic-based optimizations

590
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,209
and assessment tools to be able to go

591
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,489
in, analyze the environment, and

592
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:18,568
not just find out kind of on a chunky

593
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:19,479
basis how many CPUs,

594
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,269
how much memory, how much storage

595
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,650
the existing environment is. You guys probably already

596
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,848
know that to actually go in and determine,

597
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,699
hey, based on the Usage of these VMs

598
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,239
we think that this class of VMs deserves

599
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,430
sort of a higher priority or an

600
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,880
advanced schedule of assessment

601
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
versus some other VMs that haven't been

602
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
used and have been idle for months. So

603
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,779
that's one

604
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:42,939
fairly easy

605
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,180
optimization path that we can take

606
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,939
with our AI-based tools.

607
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
The other key one is how do we

608
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,660
analyze

609
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,420
the networking elements. So we see a lot of customers

610
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,059
that have

611
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,479
not just the compute and storage but

612
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,880
a fairly custom.

613
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,250
Networking shell that exists

614
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,368
around those VMware environments. What do we do with that?

615
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,608
How do we take what might be, say, a very

616
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,469
flat layer 2 environment

617
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:09,250
and convert that over to, say, a more scalable,

618
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,189
routable layer 3?

619
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,390
Our AI tools will help analyze and assess

620
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,078
the networking

621
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:18,130
aspects, not just from the aggregation

622
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,729
layer, but all the way down into the

623
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,789
VVC layer which will interact

624
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:24,209
with the EC2 instances.

625
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,900
And I think most importantly again, if

626
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,400
you have an environment where it's maybe

627
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:30,838
a couple dozen or a couple 100 VMs we probably

628
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:33,098
can, we can do that all fairly manually,

629
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,039
old school

630
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:35,920
spreadsheets, but if we're dealing with

631
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:38,650
tens and tens of thousands of VMs

632
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,779
across multiple sites, that's not all gonna

633
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,900
happen at once. So what becomes.

634
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,750
Really handy

635
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,989
is how do we do proper wave analysis?

636
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,650
How do we analyze it and then determine how

637
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,049
to reload into your

638
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,088
environment in waves that make sense

639
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,130
from a standpoint of the criticality of

640
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,568
those applications being migrated from a VM

641
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,608
over to EC2 or perhaps being containerized

642
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,479
at the same time.

643
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,809
So all this is basically being done by AWS

644
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,328
Transform.

645
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:07,180
This is a new tool that we launched earlier

646
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,858
this year and specifically

647
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:12,239
designed to basically analyze

648
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,939
the variety of

649
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:17,078
migration workloads VMware,

650
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:18,910
mainframe,

651
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,660
also virtualized but non-VM based

652
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,949
legacy virtualized applications

653
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,578
and determine not just the infrastructure.

654
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:29,545
Path but perhaps to also

655
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,045
suggest and optimize the coding of

656
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,164
the application itself. So as an

657
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:34,785
example,

658
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:37,805
taking mainframe legacy cobalt

659
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:40,184
applications and translating those over into

660
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,765
modern Java applications. So AWS

661
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,064
Transform is both an infrastructure

662
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:47,765
analyzer and modeler, but also

663
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:48,703
a discrete

664
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,743
application optimization tool,

665
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,689
OK. And there are several modules

666
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:54,828
or several

667
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:58,049
capabilities that transform

668
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,150
will take care of and whether again we're

669
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,489
specifically talking VMware or most

670
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:04,689
of our customers when they come to us, it's

671
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,709
first a VMware problem. But then it

672
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,250
changes into a multi-application problem

673
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,348
including legacy, non-virtualized databases,

674
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,209
mainframe

675
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,250
applications, very old Java

676
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:15,989
applications, etc.

677
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,289
So there's multiple

678
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:20,578
interfaces that transform is going to

679
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,670
help in, and we can go into our

680
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,789
own breakout session specifically on this. I want to make

681
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,539
sure we get to

682
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,430
Travis's section, but just as an example, just

683
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,289
this one

684
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,709
segment around

685
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,430
network conversion and migration.

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,900
This is some details as far as how

687
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,799
Transform would take care of

688
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,858
from an aspect of analyzing the source

689
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,979
of virtual NSX switches,

690
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,680
of course analyzing the RV2

691
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,719
files, as well as any third

692
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,959
party firewall or load

693
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,739
balancers or

694
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:54,279
application centric infrastructure such

695
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:54,900
as Cisco.

696
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:57,670
Determines the appropriate new

697
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,868
topology going forward and then

698
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:02,150
creates the translated AWS,

699
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:04,469
in this case the AWS network entities. Again

700
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:06,130
this is just the networking aspect.

701
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,568
There's a similar compute and storage aspect.

702
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,078
There's a wave analysis that goes into this, so it's

703
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,568
a fairly comprehensive

704
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:13,848
AI

705
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:16,430
tool that helps take that multi-month

706
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,568
migration problem statement

707
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,789
and helps us accelerate that by at least 2,

708
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,949
if not 3 orders of magnitude.

709
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:26,259
So obviously the key benefits that

710
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:28,459
we can realize from this one

711
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:29,838
from the aspect of cost and time,

712
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,459
we analyze the environment not just from a standpoint

713
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,939
of consolidation but

714
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,890
optimization moving forward with

715
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:41,180
the additional variable of doing this on prem.

716
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,670
We know we can do this in the region. A lot of you probably

717
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,368
do leverage

718
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:47,150
resources in the region, but we are talking about

719
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,368
doing all of this

720
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,828
onto on-prem cloud native

721
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,390
infra such as outposts, such as local zones

722
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,588
that have slightly different nuances because that

723
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:57,630
physical infrastructure is sitting

724
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,500
inside your environment.

725
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:01,029
So we analyze your use costs from the standpoint

726
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:02,029
of your existing infra,

727
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:04,469
your existing licensing, and try to figure

728
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,588
out how we net all that out so

729
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:08,068
that it's a single layer.

730
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,845
Cost structure from where you are right now

731
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:13,056
to where you'll be with AWS. No parallel,

732
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,974
no redundant, no double bubble costs.

733
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:17,375
We want to speed up the migrations as much

734
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,665
as possible. AI is great, but

735
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:20,915
by no means is it perfect.

736
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,546
All right, it's going to help us squeeze down a

737
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:25,665
lot of the analysis time, but there's still

738
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,894
going to be obviously a lot of

739
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:30,105
manual intervention, but it's going to be orders

740
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:32,224
of magnitude quicker than probably doing this

741
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,425
from scratch or doing this in fairly

742
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:36,500
old school. Ways as we do

743
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,582
this we're going to bring AWS security

744
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:40,621
principles to the picture as well. You hear time

745
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:41,520
and time again

746
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:44,061
that security is our top priority.

747
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:46,901
So when we look at how we're interfacing into

748
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,951
our infrastructure and into your infrastructure,

749
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:51,301
we'll be bringing in those security

750
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,921
primitives and principles in addition

751
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,421
to the obvious the migration activity

752
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,421
itself. So security, it kind of comes

753
00:27:58,421 --> 00:27:59,151
along for free,

754
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:01,421
but it's a very important industrialized.

755
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:03,656
Component in all of our modern well

756
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:06,136
practiced well architected

757
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:07,238
migration

758
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:09,777
projects and then innovate at scale

759
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,218
we of course work at scale. I mean of course we

760
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:14,258
can do this in small environments but

761
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,436
we've already engineered this to work across

762
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,886
hundreds, thousands, hundreds of

763
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:21,057
thousands of VMs and that

764
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,377
typically is the operating size we're seeing

765
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,436
for most mid to large size customers coming

766
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:25,958
to us

767
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,097
across multiple sites, sometimes continent.

768
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:32,253
in scale, this is something AWS

769
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:32,874
has become

770
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:35,682
obviously extremely good at and we've learned the patterns

771
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:38,292
to go from those those small POCs

772
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:40,323
up into those large production environments.

773
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:42,743
OK, so I hope this kind of give you a little bit

774
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:44,854
of whetting the appetite as far as how

775
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:46,894
we do it, how we approach it, and what we use it for.

776
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:49,493
And now I'm very happy to turn the

777
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:51,534
presentation over to Travis and hear about his

778
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,722
journey with Caesar's on Outpost.

779
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:54,733
Thank you, Travis very much.

780
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,250
Uh, thank you all for, uh, for having me. My name

781
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,650
is, uh, Travis McVeigh. Uh, I've been with

782
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,828
Caesars, um, Entertainment for

783
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,680
4 years in, uh, August.

784
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,078
I'm actually part of, uh, the digital part of the

785
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,219
business that runs the sports book and

786
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:10,910
race book and i gaming sector,

787
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,469
um, not so much the, the hotel

788
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:15,568
and, uh, you know, the, the palace that you will see

789
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:16,969
here, but if you go into the sports book,

790
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,250
all those kiosks, if you wanna go place a bet,

791
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:21,328
that is all managed by, uh, by my, by my

792
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:23,650
team. Um, so

793
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,689
first let's go into just a little bit of background of

794
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:27,949
what Caesars Entertainment is. Uh,

795
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:30,229
you know, we all know what Caesars Palace is, but

796
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,680
we, we're, we're a bit more than, than just, just

797
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,439
the palace, right?

798
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,049
So we're the largest casino entertainment

799
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,049
company in the United States and

800
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,400
one of the world's most diver diversified casino

801
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,068
entertainment, uh, providers.

802
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,598
Uh, we began in Reno, actually,

803
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,588
Nevada in 1937.

804
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,259
And uh we've grown through uh

805
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,640
development of new resorts, expansions

806
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:53,150
and acquisitions.

807
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,779
Um, you may or may not know that, but uh

808
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:57,779
we actually operate several

809
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,858
brands here in in Vegas and other places

810
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:00,910
such as the Horseshoe,

811
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,318
uh, the Link, the Flamingo, um,

812
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,459
and other big iconic brands like uh El

813
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:06,039
Dorado,

814
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,059
and then of course Caesars and Jara's.

815
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,368
Um,

816
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:11,868
we offer a full suite of mobile and

817
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:14,309
online gaming and sport betting, uh, experiences,

818
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,578
and it's, uh, all tied, uh, to

819
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:18,709
our industry leading Caesars reward, uh,

820
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,890
loyalty program.

821
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,588
Uh, we focus on building

822
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:24,630
value with, uh, with our guests in a unique

823
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,269
combination of these services,

824
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,709
and, uh, we're committed to our employees, suppliers

825
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,750
and communities and the environment through our

826
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,289
people, Planet, uh, play framework.

827
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:35,750
So just a couple of stats, uh, it.

828
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:39,130
Yes, we do have over 50,000

829
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,650
employees.

830
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,578
Um Again, I was kind of

831
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:44,739
explaining some of the different iconic brands

832
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:46,858
that that we do manage and and and do

833
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:49,180
and what Caesar's is is doing, especially

834
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,699
here in local Vegas.

835
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,559
Um, but let's dig into, to

836
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,439
my part of the business, uh, which is, you know,

837
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,559
online gambling. Um,

838
00:30:57,838 --> 00:30:59,920
you know, 2018, FASFA was, uh,

839
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,150
repealed, and, uh, it's been kind of like a rocket

840
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,189
ship, gold mine, uh, whatever you wanna,

841
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:04,858
wanna call it.

842
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,318
Um, it didn't, it didn't exist. Uh, now it's a

843
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:09,479
20 billion plus annual

844
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,868
industry. We've grown 10 times

845
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:14,189
since 2018 and almost

846
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:16,269
60%, more than half the

847
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:18,368
US is allowed to gamble now,

848
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:21,160
including Missouri, which just went live

849
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,949
on Monday.

850
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,410
But that's not why you're here. We're, we're

851
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,559
here about, uh, migration,

852
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,019
you know, VMware to, to outposts, why

853
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,059
we did it, what, what's here, right? Uh, so let's

854
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,118
get into some of the, the bad before we get into

855
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:36,219
some of the, the good of, of what we

856
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:36,799
were running.

857
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
So we had complexity, um,

858
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,779
you know, I don't know about all of you, but our dev and

859
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:42,920
production didn't exactly

860
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,078
match,

861
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
um, you know, it's very easy to just scale

862
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,078
and build apps on AWS,

863
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:50,739
um, but we have a very, very

864
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:52,900
interesting problem that we have to solve that not a lot

865
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,170
of. Industries have to solve,

866
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,618
uh, and that is uh the wire Act.

867
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,189
So in order for us to take a bet in the

868
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:02,279
US, the bet actually has to

869
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,779
take place in the state

870
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,269
you're like, well how do you do that? Well, uh, uh, it's

871
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:07,559
up to, you know,

872
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,779
the legal,

873
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,868
uh, rules of what that is,

874
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,539
but effectively the transaction has to occur

875
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,338
on prem.

876
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,219
so I can never move

877
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,019
my betting engine

878
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,098
off of

879
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,759
on-prem. It has to stay in the state.

880
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:24,068
And what's er really funny is sometimes

881
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,189
it's in the back of a casino, cos that's the only place that

882
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:27,809
I'm actually allowed to do it.

883
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,868
Um, and because of that, you know, I have

884
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,229
a VMware workload that's in there, and I'm

885
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:35,348
have my devs testing in, in AWS,

886
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,789
and then you get some weird things like your, the,

887
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,568
the, the container won't just even run

888
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:42,818
because one of the, you know, we're running EVC

889
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:45,098
on some of these things and, and the, the,

890
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:46,430
the proc options that

891
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,828
the, the CPU options that the app actually needs

892
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,939
to run. Isn't available

893
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,500
and uh you have to fix that, right?

894
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:56,078
It's working everywhere else and in this one state it it

895
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:57,118
the deployment fails.

896
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,500
So lots of, lots of complexity

897
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,150
uh around the data residency and

898
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,848
then not matching.

899
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,660
We also have the cost, right? Uh, so, so,

900
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,719
you know, here we have maybe

901
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,880
HP software, here we have Dell, here

902
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,519
you have this vendor XYZ.

903
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,509
Uh, and VMware is giving you that, that

904
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:16,588
abstraction layer, but you still have to, you still

905
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:18,588
have to upgrade the firmware on these. You still have to make

906
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:19,729
sure that things are all working

907
00:33:20,068 --> 00:33:22,150
and not to mention if you have some software that's

908
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,449
managing the, the VMware build

909
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,630
in its own, in itself kind of in its

910
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,709
own bubble, um, how to manage the pat.

911
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,223
Matching of all of those environments, you know, we're, we have

912
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:33,443
over 30 jurisdictions where we have these

913
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,765
environments at and, and to upgrade

914
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,525
all of those VMV centers,

915
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:40,824
um, another part is, is how do

916
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:42,894
you get your, your golden image out to

917
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:43,924
all these environments,

918
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,285
um, you know,

919
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:47,233
it, it, it's not, it's not easy.

920
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:49,644
User experience, um, you know,

921
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,535
if you go and you place a bet in Caesars Palace

922
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:53,394
or Link.

923
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,489
Do you know whether it's running on Outpost or VMware?

924
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:58,400
You don't care,

925
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,269
you just wanna make sure your bet goes.

926
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:02,750
That's a big thing that that we had to understand is

927
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,930
we have all this complexity, we're trying to manage

928
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,289
all of this. By the end of the day, what actual

929
00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:09,409
customer value are we adding

930
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:10,869
for all this headache?

931
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,000
But, but it's a good question, and, and

932
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,079
we had to ask ourselves that. Do we wanna go build it

933
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,119
ourselves and do bare metal?

934
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,199
Do we wanna continue with VMware, or do we

935
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,500
wanna run, uh, an outpost and, and

936
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,679
just kind of ob obfuscate all

937
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,918
that away so that we can focus on higher

938
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:27,699
customer value,

939
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,728
uh, items.

940
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,780
And the last piece is, is performance.

941
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,949
You know, yes,

942
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,438
you can make your VMware environment

943
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:36,599
performant, but I mean,

944
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,019
just show of hands, how many people have seen someone

945
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:41,159
that says, hey, I'm gonna make my database faster

946
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,039
by putting 60 CPUs on it.

947
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,438
Um, yeah, that's, that's, that's not gonna

948
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:47,438
work. Um, and, and

949
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:49,519
what really happens with Outposts is it

950
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,519
forces you to rethink your deployment

951
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,579
strategy and, and we'll get into that in, uh,

952
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,360
in a little bit more.

953
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:57,309
So what did our

954
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,050
VMware architecture effectively look like and

955
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,168
why is it gonna be easy for us to to

956
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,289
migrate things because uh I'm gonna explain how

957
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:05,929
fast we do these and you're gonna be like

958
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,289
you're you're lying, so let's let's get

959
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,329
that out of the way. I, I'm not lying, all the things I'm

960
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,059
gonna tell you are true.

961
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:13,969
What we were running was Capi, which is uh

962
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:16,010
the open source version of Kubernetes

963
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,909
on VMware.

964
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:19,269
Almost all of our workloads are.

965
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,139
Uh,

966
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:22,389
containerized running in Kubernetes,

967
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:24,840
and the only things outside of that were our

968
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,030
database VMs, uh, just because

969
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,590
we can't get, uh, the the recovery

970
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,590
time, uh, and the recovery point objective

971
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,860
that we need in Cube.

972
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,349
Uh, we're close. I want to get those things in there so

973
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:36,949
bad, but we're just not quite there,

974
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,668
um, and then we have the storage gateway so

975
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:40,889
that, uh, we can manage,

976
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:43,300
uh, backups and get them off site to meet our, uh,

977
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,228
regulatory

978
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:45,369
requirements.

979
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,989
So for us it was a pretty simple stack, but

980
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,168
we. Continue to drive

981
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,208
this way to make sure that the dev

982
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,378
experience is the same

983
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,969
even with the the hardware being different, right?

984
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,239
We wanted the devs to be able to create a container,

985
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,110
to create an app,

986
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,570
and deploy it whether it was in AWS or

987
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,719
within VMware and you know all the Kubernetti

988
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,429
stories are true, right?

989
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,929
As long as my team managed that

990
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,409
infrastructure, it was the same.

991
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,739
But again, I, I, when I'm talking about what the

992
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,789
difference is, is my team had to deal with

993
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,829
all of that difference. We had to manage

994
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,869
Cappy. We had to manage our upgrades. We had

995
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:18,949
to make sure that the golden image was there

996
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:19,510
and would boot.

997
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,789
We had to manage all the firewall rules to make sure all

998
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,289
the communication would work.

999
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:24,590
And you know,

1000
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,349
we love hammering our VCenter for all of our

1001
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:29,750
um, our CSI volumes that Kubernetes

1002
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,530
is constantly doing. So I don't know if you've

1003
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:33,989
tried that, but it's, uh, it's, it, it can

1004
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,389
take a while to move a.

1005
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:38,260
Move a cloud uh native

1006
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
disc is what they call it,

1007
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,699
from one VM to another when you're when you're doing your

1008
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,938
upgrades. So

1009
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:45,958
what lives on our outpost racks now?

1010
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:47,000
So

1011
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:48,280
what we've done is

1012
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,099
we've moved to where we have C

1013
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:52,840
nodes and M nodes um

1014
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,769
for, for the different applications.

1015
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:57,418
So here we have our C nodes for our database.

1016
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,199
So if you look at the previous slide,

1017
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,378
right, we've just moved the VMDBs

1018
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,878
over into C node

1019
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,320
VMs. We then

1020
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,438
have our EKS on outpost, so that

1021
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,559
now I'm not upgrading Cappy, I'm not

1022
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,559
testing Cappy, I'm not trying to make sure all those

1023
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,260
things are working,

1024
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,679
and I don't have this single VMware instance

1025
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,539
that's in my dev

1026
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:18,329
that I have one engineer that can iterate on slowly.

1027
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,599
Now we have AWS with EKS and I can,

1028
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,750
I can rapidly make sure that all of our

1029
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:25,159
Damon sets and helm charts and things

1030
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,179
are working. We do have a

1031
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,188
couple of extra

1032
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:31,329
resources that we do cause you know, now, now

1033
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:33,369
we're wanting to use Route 53, more cloud

1034
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:35,750
native services, but you have to think of things

1035
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,929
uh in a little bit of a different way. Outpost

1036
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,070
is anchored to a region.

1037
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:42,188
Well, what happens if that connection to

1038
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:43,389
the region goes down,

1039
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,869
right? It's a, it's a very serious thing that you

1040
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,949
have to think about. It's a different way to think

1041
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,949
about because you are dependent on the region,

1042
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:51,789
even though the, the instances are there,

1043
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:54,148
you're still dependent on it. So we wanted to put

1044
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,148
in as much resilience as we

1045
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,458
could that, you know, we can serve stale

1046
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,550
cash when, when things are because

1047
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,550
our IPs aren't really changing. You can see

1048
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,590
we're, we have a pretty static item, we just need to make sure

1049
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,829
ingress gets into the cluster and then

1050
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:07,398
everything works.

1051
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,869
So that's why we have this our Route 53.

1052
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,628
Um, managed

1053
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,010
EC2 instances still have the storage

1054
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,010
gateway, so you can see our, ours was,

1055
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,458
you know, you could say lift and shift, but the thing that made it

1056
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,668
lift and shift for us was

1057
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,530
effectively Kubernetes, right? We,

1058
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,289
the, the stories of, you know, we wanna be able

1059
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,539
to move clouds easily with our apps, uh,

1060
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,648
we were able to actually test that theory and,

1061
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,769
and go forward with it, um, you

1062
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,030
know, in this case it's private cloud to, to

1063
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:33,969
outpost, but.

1064
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,500
Uh, really worked.

1065
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,739
You're like, wait, I didn't see any S3, I love

1066
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:39,398
S3.

1067
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,019
You're right, um, S3 is going to add a

1068
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,269
ton of.

1069
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Nodes to your outpost rack, it's also gonna

1070
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,139
add to the cost,

1071
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,750
so you gotta really think, is that what I wanna do? And

1072
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,750
like I said, we have 34 +

1073
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,869
jurisdictions that we're doing in, so every single

1074
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:55,418
time I'm adding

1075
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,099
cost, I gotta multiply that by

1076
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,579
30, and you can see the number gets up there very,

1077
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,199
very quickly. So it's how can we be.

1078
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,478
Adaptive to what we need but also

1079
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:07,559
cost conscious for the CFO.

1080
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,958
So what we've also done is, is

1081
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:13,090
tried to, you know, the dependency of

1082
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,090
a single outpost is that it's

1083
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,208
tied to availability zone, right? So you have to think

1084
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,398
of an outpost rack

1085
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:20,840
as an availability zone. It is not a region,

1086
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:21,878
it is a zone.

1087
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:24,449
I don't have an extra SLA. I don't have an extra

1088
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,168
failover. Yes, if a, if a.

1089
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,260
Uh, if a

1090
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,869
server fails,

1091
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,679
I have redundancy built into that.

1092
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:34,219
If a network switch fails, I have redundancy

1093
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,250
into that, but if the whole rack goes down

1094
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,469
or my service link goes down, I'm tied

1095
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:40,550
to that availability zone, and some of you will

1096
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,708
probably have the question,

1097
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:44,228
were you impacted by the US East One region?

1098
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,648
Yes, we were,

1099
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,289
we were very, very

1100
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,590
fortunate in mitigating it because of our

1101
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,949
design of utilizing a shared BPC

1102
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:54,059
for most of our services to route

1103
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,429
over the logical gateway. If you looked at Frank's

1104
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,909
earlier slides, he had some.

1105
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,280
He had one little bullet that said, you know,

1106
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,590
networking via the logical gateway,

1107
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:05,128
and we've really pushed that to try and make our service

1108
00:40:05,128 --> 00:40:06,208
end points over that

1109
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,570
so that if our service link goes down that single

1110
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,469
point of failure,

1111
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,030
um, we can still route back out and

1112
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:14,260
take a bet, right, because that's our transaction, we

1113
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,250
wanna be able to take a bet.

1114
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:18,559
Um, we then put some managed nodes in the other availabilities

1115
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,760
nodes, uh, uh, availability zones

1116
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
again to make sure that, that, you know, any kind

1117
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,840
of services that are running in those, um,

1118
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,458
so if that availability goes down,

1119
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,750
we can still make sure that traffic is, is flowing

1120
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,110
and updating such as, uh,

1121
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:31,659
you know, Route 53, etc.

1122
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,349
And then what we do is we split our

1123
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,099
outpost.

1124
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:36,938
Um, it does open

1125
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,599
the option that if any availability zone

1126
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,269
fails, we would be impacted.

1127
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,559
But if an availability zone is impacted,

1128
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,679
not all of our sites are. So it's again a

1129
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,719
design decision. It could be different for your business

1130
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,034
model. This is what we decided, uh,

1131
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,244
you know, work with your account managers and your essays

1132
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,324
to really try to figure out what works for

1133
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:55,875
you, um, because, you know, this,

1134
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,204
it's not one size fits all. You have to figure out what works

1135
00:40:58,204 --> 00:40:59,003
for your business,

1136
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:01,554
what your resiliency is, and what you're, you're, you

1137
00:41:01,554 --> 00:41:03,523
know, willing to, to, to have.

1138
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,969
Slotting, does anybody know what slotting is?

1139
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah, I have, it's one hand, OK, so.

1140
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:11,878
VMware has made this

1141
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,219
so simple, right? Like if you think about

1142
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:16,219
before VMware, what did you have to do? You would go and you'd

1143
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:18,260
figure out how many servers I could fit

1144
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,019
in a rack,

1145
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,739
how much power I have, um, thank

1146
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,860
you for all your power guidance back in my early

1147
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,409
career, Brad,

1148
00:41:24,688 --> 00:41:25,978
and uh, you know,

1149
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,619
you, you could only fit so much in a rack, and

1150
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,699
then by that you can only fit so many apps in

1151
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,260
that rack.

1152
00:41:31,878 --> 00:41:33,898
You, you, you do go back to that a little

1153
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:36,159
bit with outpost, and you have to really rethink it

1154
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,559
because what I could do is I could overcommit my VMware

1155
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,599
resources, right? So if you want a VM you want a VM,

1156
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,360
yeah, sure,

1157
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:43,639
as long as I hit my 6 to 1 ratio and as long

1158
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,840
as my critical apps are, are right size

1159
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,019
enough, um, I'm OK.

1160
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,079
Well, that, that's great, but now I have

1161
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:53,079
all of these VMs sitting that have all of these

1162
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,219
massive resource requirements that probably

1163
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:55,978
aren't real.

1164
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:59,590
The other thing that you have to think about too is that,

1165
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,699
you know, for us we had Kubernetes, so think about

1166
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,869
the number of schedulers we have. We have

1167
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:04,849
the, the base

1168
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:07,510
host which has, you know, CPU

1169
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,449
you have the VMware scheduler,

1170
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:11,869
we then have the virtual machine which is also

1171
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,139
scheduling CPUs.

1172
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,539
I then have Kubernetes and then I have my

1173
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,599
container. Wow.

1174
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,329
Since I don't have the VMware orchestration

1175
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:23,679
layer now and I'm running right on the,

1176
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,168
the droplet of the server of uh the

1177
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:26,909
outpost,

1178
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:29,489
I'm getting a 1 to 1 CPU so I'm no longer

1179
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,610
having that CPU swap, the CPU wait

1180
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,590
time, that's, that's gone.

1181
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,050
The CPU wait, the CPU ready that you've been

1182
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,168
sitting and looking at your graphs forever

1183
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:39,369
and you're like, why is my VM slow? That, that's

1184
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:40,188
not, that doesn't exist,

1185
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,688
but you have to put.

1186
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,668
The work up front,

1187
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:45,070
spend

1188
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:45,869
time

1189
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:48,289
right sizing your stuff, otherwise you're gonna buy

1190
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,389
way too much hardware.

1191
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,000
And

1192
00:42:51,478 --> 00:42:53,750
you're gonna be looking at what do I do with this extra

1193
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,829
hardware, um,

1194
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,458
so we're seeing 4 times

1195
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:00,000
performance because we're no longer swapping

1196
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,760
with our database nodes, right? Our database nodes

1197
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,840
were again the bet has to take place on prem.

1198
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:07,840
Well, what does that mean? That means that I have to have a transaction.

1199
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,739
Transaction hits a database.

1200
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,679
If that's swapping in and out while it's trying to replicate

1201
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,019
and be highly available,

1202
00:43:14,478 --> 00:43:16,719
and then now I don't need any of that swapping.

1203
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:18,849
And then what what do we do is we took,

1204
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,829
we realized that we didn't need our nodes to be as big.

1205
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,469
So now in order to strip it across, I

1206
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,260
get these extra slots that now I have

1207
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,489
extra uh compute Kubernetes nodes that are

1208
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,750
very optimized for CPU and now I can

1209
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,719
put different database technologies

1210
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:35,969
that before I was super scared to put onto

1211
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:38,510
in Cube, and I'm ready to go. So the last

1212
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,128
thing, like I said, is we need to get our

1213
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,050
other database nodes off of these dedicated.

1214
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:45,978
Instant slots, I can move those into Kubernetes

1215
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:48,458
and I'm gonna actually be able to flow my

1216
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,139
environment,

1217
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:51,918
much like a DRS or an HA item,

1218
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,019
but using Kubernetes to manage that for me and

1219
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:56,019
not all the underlying VMware

1220
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:57,699
stuff I'm, I'm paying for, right.

1221
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,639
So What

1222
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,699
was our journey like?

1223
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,800
Um, we, we,

1224
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,780
my team moves and they move fast,

1225
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,320
so we, we've tried to figure out everything that we could. We

1226
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,398
designed it, we took the time up front to slot it, right

1227
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:13,070
size it.

1228
00:44:13,398 --> 00:44:15,679
We worked with the account team to get a

1229
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:17,699
test environment up to so we could make sure

1230
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:18,438
that it worked,

1231
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,989
and then we put the pedal to the metal. So

1232
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:23,398
in July we had 4 racks installed

1233
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:24,869
and we migrated 2 states.

1234
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,438
In August we got 1 more rack installed,

1235
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,699
and I we migrated 2 states.

1236
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:30,938
In September.

1237
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,019
We installed 5 more racks

1238
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,398
and we migrated a state every

1239
00:44:36,398 --> 00:44:37,239
single week.

1240
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:39,458
We got our downtime.

1241
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,398
That I couldn't serve customers down to 2

1242
00:44:42,398 --> 00:44:42,938
hours.

1243
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:47,969
We then figured out new ways to do our database

1244
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,010
migrations over the logical gateways so that we

1245
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,438
could replicate things so that when our cutover happened,

1246
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,110
it was almost instantaneously

1247
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:55,208
and then

1248
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:57,878
through. Um, if,

1249
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,539
if you're, uh, familiar with anti-infinity rules,

1250
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:03,360
you, you have to think about how some of the services

1251
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,179
work, right? So for us,

1252
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:08,148
we don't like a single point of failure, and,

1253
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,320
um, we had to identify, you know, what

1254
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,360
services we wanted to use, and so one

1255
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,750
of the key pieces is

1256
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,599
you do lose the hyperplane on outpost,

1257
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,840
right? So I can't use a network load

1258
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,090
balancer in the rack, right?

1259
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,478
I can use one in the region and forward it,

1260
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,179
or I'm given an ALB option.

1261
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,750
Depending on your slotting, ALB

1262
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,958
may work very well for you.

1263
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,398
For us it didn't, right? We, we had to have so much

1264
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:34,659
capacity for the upgrades and the managed service

1265
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:36,760
of the ALB because it's designed

1266
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,958
to run in region,

1267
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,070
not an outpost.

1268
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
So again, it's depending on your solution, but

1269
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,554
we, we. Decided that that wouldn't

1270
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,603
work for us because we have a single rack, we

1271
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:46,503
need to do it. So again,

1272
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,885
we're constantly what the, the point I'm trying

1273
00:45:48,885 --> 00:45:49,784
to make is, is that

1274
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,125
while we're migrating, we're learning and

1275
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,195
we're improving, and it's an important thing that

1276
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:56,405
you do as you do waves, right? We're doing states

1277
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,905
because it's the same app over and over again.

1278
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,769
But you know when you stop and look at most

1279
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:03,309
applications, whether it's a web tier, it's an app tier, it's a database,

1280
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:04,750
and it has dependencies,

1281
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:07,418
right? Once you get good and once you figure out what the dependencies

1282
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:09,429
are, you're just rinse and repeating, right?

1283
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,668
You get on that rotation and, and that, and that's what's

1284
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:12,728
important to, to really

1285
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:15,550
recognize. Hey, I'll, I'll keep going through the timeline.

1286
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:18,110
October we installed, uh, another 6 racks.

1287
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:21,090
November, uh, unfortunately,

1288
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,208
uh, December I was hoping that we would have 20,

1289
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:24,989
um,

1290
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:26,010
we, uh.

1291
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,938
We're, we're hoping to restart that, uh,

1292
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:31,228
backup, um, but we did improve our uh

1293
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:33,250
DR design which we're really excited about,

1294
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:34,168
uh, because

1295
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:35,728
effectively we're able to use

1296
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:38,610
our regional availability

1297
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,769
zone designs

1298
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,228
and just replicate it now to outpost, which

1299
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:44,429
again is, you know, if you're thinking

1300
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,510
that way, cloud native and you're thinking about multi

1301
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,289
availability or multi-regional,

1302
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,739
that, that is just gonna help you with your,

1303
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,949
your overall outpost design.

1304
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,059
So we go back to the challenges

1305
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:58,349
that we talked about and it's like, OK, so

1306
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,458
what was, what was it? We had experience and

1307
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,519
complexity. I now have a single

1308
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,039
AMI

1309
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,898
and I can share it with all the outposts because it's in the same,

1310
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:08,239
you know, it's in, it's in the account and I can, I can deploy

1311
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:08,780
it fast.

1312
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:12,909
I talked about the 1 to 1 CPU.

1313
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:15,708
Sometimes it's, you know, depending on how we configure

1314
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,039
the app, I've, we've gotten 3 times performance.

1315
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:20,418
Uh, I, I know I said 4 earlier, uh,

1316
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:22,550
we're trying to constantly tweak things and make things

1317
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,668
better, but again, because I don't have to have

1318
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:26,708
that 6 to 1 ratio, I have a

1319
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:28,750
1:1 ratio to really think

1320
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,300
about that.

1321
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,250
Does my database actually need 24 CPUs?

1322
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:34,369
If it was running on bare metal,

1323
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:36,059
how many CPUs would you give it?

1324
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:38,750
Probably not 24, I'd start with 12,

1325
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:39,679
see how that works.

1326
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,280
So really think about that and what it works

1327
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,478
and then think about the slotting because you

1328
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:45,139
know again,

1329
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,648
every slot

1330
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:50,000
is gonna consume that and again with

1331
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,860
the new gen twos you get a lot more

1332
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,340
scale, a lot more uh these are still the

1333
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,438
the the gen ones, but uh it's it's

1334
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:57,398
important to to think about.

1335
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,829
And then for us it was guaranteed pricing,

1336
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,728
so I, I don't know how many of you are interacting

1337
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:06,228
with with Broadcom, but we were very nervous

1338
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:07,849
when that conversation was starting.

1339
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,429
Um, and, uh, it didn't seem

1340
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,668
to matter the number of things we changed

1341
00:48:12,668 --> 00:48:14,708
in the equation. The number always ended up

1342
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,789
being the same at the end. Um, I don't know

1343
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:18,099
how that works, but, um,

1344
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,599
we, we, we wanted to make sure that our,

1345
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:23,059
our pricing was, was guaranteed, uh,

1346
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,148
so that we could commit to the business that this

1347
00:48:25,148 --> 00:48:27,389
is what our cost is going to be year over year

1348
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:29,478
and this is what it's going to be to add a new state

1349
00:48:29,728 --> 00:48:31,869
and um that was, that was really

1350
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:34,070
important and I think the last piece that's

1351
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:34,969
really important

1352
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,570
is it's not just.

1353
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:40,369
VMware, it's, it's not right. You have

1354
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,469
your storage vendors, right? Like how many of you

1355
00:48:42,688 --> 00:48:44,070
go in, you love the storage,

1356
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,489
you love all that, it gets bought by another company, all of

1357
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,570
a sudden the price goes through the roof, or they

1358
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,809
are decomming that now you're having to migrate

1359
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:52,889
it, right? How much effort, how much time are your

1360
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:53,750
team spending

1361
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:54,789
to move.

1362
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,398
Storage devices,

1363
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:00,070
and what value did that bring to your customers?

1364
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:01,128
0.

1365
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,668
So you spent all that engineering time,

1366
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:05,989
you spent all of that capital, you

1367
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:08,119
spent all that operational cost, all the

1368
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,320
planning to move it so that there was 0

1369
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,610
downtime, you celebrated, it was so great,

1370
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:14,179
and your customers saw

1371
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:15,438
that much value.

1372
00:49:16,878 --> 00:49:19,090
Right, like that, and that's the key piece, right?

1373
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,320
How, how do, how do I put that in terms that

1374
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,438
you, you know, your, your C-suite understands

1375
00:49:24,438 --> 00:49:26,639
is, is that, that, that's the, that's the selling piece,

1376
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,010
and that was what we, we really wanted to do.

1377
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:31,938
And the last piece is, uh, is hardware, right? Uh, you know, I mentioned,

1378
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:33,978
you know, you'll get into a hardware vendor.

1379
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,039
You fully know how to support it. You'll buy their

1380
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,648
management software to handle all the firmware

1381
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:40,329
upgrades,

1382
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,619
and then they get bought out or

1383
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,699
they no longer support that. And now you're

1384
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:46,978
going to their version too, and there's no upgrade

1385
00:49:46,978 --> 00:49:47,750
path and no,

1386
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,619
it, it, it's constant cost

1387
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:51,679
that again, you know,

1388
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:53,938
Frank was, uh, and Scott were talking about the

1389
00:49:53,938 --> 00:49:55,039
hidden costs that you just

1390
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,458
don't really think about unless you kind of take a step back

1391
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:58,079
and you're like,

1392
00:49:58,418 --> 00:49:58,989
hold on,

1393
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,519
what am I actually delivering to my customer?

1394
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,820
Is my customer the dev? Is my customer actual

1395
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,519
end user?

1396
00:50:04,773 --> 00:50:06,824
And uh that's that's what we really sat and

1397
00:50:06,824 --> 00:50:08,905
thought thought about before we went and

1398
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,313
did all you know we could have done bare metal Kubernetes.

1399
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:13,445
I have full, full faith in my team

1400
00:50:13,864 --> 00:50:16,125
we could have done it we could have done it very well

1401
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:17,844
and on paper it would have looked cheaper

1402
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:20,125
but then when I think about all the vendor and the

1403
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,184
swaps and all that.

1404
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:22,829
What value?

1405
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,228
Um, so, you know, I've, I've kind of hit

1406
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:29,250
on several of these, and I feel like I'm going a

1407
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,378
little fast, um, but, uh, you know,

1408
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,550
lessons learned.

1409
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:35,878
Plan your deployment slotting. I, I

1410
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,878
know I keep bringing this up, but slotting is so important.

1411
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:39,530
It's a whole new paradigm shift,

1412
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,059
and every single managed service that you want

1413
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:44,340
will also consume a slot, right? So if you,

1414
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,559
you, you know, it was a great slide that showed that you could

1415
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,599
go to EC-2s and then you could go to

1416
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,719
a managed RDS.

1417
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,188
Well, managed RDS is still gonna consume a slot.

1418
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,280
You don't get it for free.

1419
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:54,869
That's going to be used.

1420
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,378
And if you want it redundant, that's

1421
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,039
now two slots that you've taken up.

1422
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,820
You want an ALB that's going to take slots.

1423
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:03,938
They also have to do upgrades. Well, in order to

1424
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:05,978
do an upgrade, you no downtime. You

1425
00:51:05,978 --> 00:51:07,539
have to deploy that third one.

1426
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:09,489
Decomm the other one,

1427
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:12,010
right, so you have to have that room, that elastic

1428
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,119
capacity that that's not necessarily

1429
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:16,168
there, um, and then

1430
00:51:16,168 --> 00:51:18,530
the storage gateways, they, they all consume

1431
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,648
slots, and when we first went in there we didn't

1432
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:22,688
think about that, we just went and we're like, yeah, this is what

1433
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,809
we need. Fortunately we got the performance

1434
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:27,260
increase that gave us that additional capacity,

1435
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,809
but if you're not that lucky it could really put you into

1436
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:31,889
a bad position when you're trying to set up and you, you

1437
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,329
never want your first one to go bad, right?

1438
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,500
So please learn that lesson,

1439
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:38,039
Work with slotting, work with the teams to really

1440
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:40,199
test the things that you want and make sure that it'll

1441
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,500
fit. Backup

1442
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,590
power I think that's so

1443
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,309
simple, right?

1444
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:46,260
Um,

1445
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,269
one thing that hit us is, like I said, we, we

1446
00:51:49,269 --> 00:51:51,369
put things in the back sometimes of a casino,

1447
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,648
so we would

1448
00:51:53,188 --> 00:51:55,309
have our VMware rack there and if the power went

1449
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:57,349
out, which sometimes does because the

1450
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,168
casino doesn't necessarily have a,

1451
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:01,708
a, you know, production data center grade

1452
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,849
UPS that it just automatically flips on,

1453
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:04,739
um,

1454
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,889
we power it back on

1455
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:08,539
VMware would come on we.

1456
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:10,579
Right click yes,

1457
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:12,309
you're not a read only file system,

1458
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,978
everything is good, next, next, next,

1459
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:16,389
and then we're back up, right? And it would take, it would take, you

1460
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:17,429
know, 15 minutes.

1461
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,168
This is an entire cloud

1462
00:52:21,168 --> 00:52:23,389
that has to boot. It has to connect to the region.

1463
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:25,489
It has to provision. It has to make sure

1464
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:27,628
that it does all of its security checks, has to

1465
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:29,708
set up all the metadata services that we take for

1466
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,780
granted, you know, the metadata service that,

1467
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:34,148
you know, sends who it is and it's IP

1468
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:36,148
and everything, all of that has to, has to

1469
00:52:36,148 --> 00:52:37,530
power up and come online

1470
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:40,030
and, and that takes hours. It's

1471
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,708
not, it's not minutes,

1472
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,418
so. Make sure you

1473
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:45,199
have either

1474
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:48,159
separate redundant power or you

1475
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,659
purchase the UPS and you put it there so

1476
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:52,699
that it will keep the rack on. I, I

1477
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:53,438
just

1478
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:56,260
please learn that lesson that I've gone

1479
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,260
through and had to explain that you

1480
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:58,820
won't have to.

1481
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:02,070
Uh, I think the biggest thing that we did

1482
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:04,489
is my team identified some of the single point

1483
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:06,489
of failures of, uh, the, you know,

1484
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,030
the service link like I talked about.

1485
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,119
So what we did is we worked with the account team and we were

1486
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:11,679
like, hey,

1487
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,429
this is whole new for us.

1488
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:16,079
What things could fail, what we don't know.

1489
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:18,329
Let's put our brains together and think of

1490
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,570
everything that could fail. What about a server

1491
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,889
failing? What about the service link failing? What about

1492
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:24,320
Route 53 going down?

1493
00:53:24,898 --> 00:53:27,010
What what are all of these things that could do, and

1494
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,289
let's build runbooks and let's make sure our app

1495
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,510
could, can, can go. Um,

1496
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:34,050
and we did, and we, we tested them all, we had runbooks,

1497
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:34,809
it was all great.

1498
00:53:35,398 --> 00:53:37,550
One thing I will also tell you is if you're gonna test

1499
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,628
service link failure, test it for longer than 2

1500
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:42,090
hours. It's, uh, it's helpful,

1501
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:44,760
um, and then, you know, I've talked about the VMware

1502
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,789
HA DRS a lot, so I don't wanna spend too

1503
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:49,188
much time on it, and, and it kind of goes back to the slotting,

1504
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:50,329
but it, it's again,

1505
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,708
what do you really need to run, you know, it's, it's

1506
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,869
real simple. Like if you run it in region, just

1507
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,228
pick the version that you want to run

1508
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,744
on that and, and hammer. It right. And if

1509
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:01,744
you can't, you know, if you have a lower environment, you should

1510
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:03,563
be able to just shift it over there,

1511
00:54:04,215 --> 00:54:06,664
test it, see what you get on those M5

1512
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:08,664
an M5 and region is the same thing that's running

1513
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:10,603
an outpost, so you should get the same

1514
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:13,023
CPU memory performance that you're expecting,

1515
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:15,144
same with a C7 and M7. But

1516
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:16,563
you know, really test it.

1517
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:17,945
Take the time to do it.

1518
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,878
Uh, I think,

1519
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,418
uh, and that's, that's all I have, so, yeah,

1520
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:24,239
thanks, Travis,

1521
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:26,719
thank you. Thank you so much.

1522
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,030
Some closing thoughts before we go.

1523
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:33,418
Please come to visit us

1524
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:34,849
at the

1525
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,320
AWS village.

1526
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,389
There you have a kiosk talking

1527
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:41,418
about migration and modernization.

1528
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:44,228
You can see a real outpost wreck.

1529
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:47,300
And there is also a kiosk for the local

1530
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:47,898
zones.

1531
00:54:49,148 --> 00:54:50,590
Please don't forget to complete.

1532
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:52,860
The post-event session survey.

1533
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:56,010
And we will be taking questions.

1534
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:57,820
At the back of the session.

1535
00:54:59,079 --> 00:54:59,929
Thank you all for coming.

1536
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:01,648
Thank you, thank you.
