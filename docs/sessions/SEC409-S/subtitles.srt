1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,289
Uh, as David mentioned, my name's Justin Kagan.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,448
I am the VP of revenue integrity

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,488
operational compliance for a company called Arrivia.

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,849
It's really a fancy way of saying that anything

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,919
that deals with revenue, I stick my nose into

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,390
and kind of piss everybody else off.

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,448
Uh, I'm also a certified fraud examiner

8
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,370
through the ACFE.

9
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,589
And that's just again, another fiancecy way of saying

10
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,629
that I love fraud and I've been

11
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:22,870
trained in how to detect fraud.

12
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:25,609
Um, and I will start off by saying, yes,

13
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,010
that is my quote up there.

14
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:29,219
And so a little bit about me,

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,940
when I was younger, when kids wanted to be

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,679
police officers, firefighters,

17
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,060
doctors, whatever.

18
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,130
I wanted to be a criminal.

19
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,429
It, it was exciting, right? Like it was,

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,689
it seemed like it was fun. And the reason being,

21
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,689
and it goes with uh my little picture there,

22
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,408
so I fell in love with this movie called Hudson Hawk.

23
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,090
It's a movie with Bruce Willis in it,

24
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,329
very campy, cheesy movie,

25
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,740
but Bruce Willis plays an art thief in

26
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,490
the, the movie.

27
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,728
And he just gets released from jail and he gets suckered

28
00:00:58,728 --> 00:00:59,590
back into

29
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:01,918
Doing another heist,

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,129
uh, once he gets back out and it's just

31
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:06,400
a lot of campy zany fun

32
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:08,629
and as a child seeing that I was like that looks

33
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:10,209
really cool. I like art.

34
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,790
He's an art thief,

35
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,028
therefore I should,

36
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:15,088
this seems like it should be fun to do,

37
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,168
um.

38
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,609
But as I grew up,

39
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:20,069
you know, everybody told me

40
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:21,489
crime doesn't pay.

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,829
Which I feel like that might be a lie

42
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,870
now. Uh, it seems like, you know, the more

43
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,870
notorious you are, you get movies, you

44
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,870
get documentaries, you get to be on

45
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,209
Dancing with the Stars,

46
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:34,750
uh, all sorts of fun things that, you know, you

47
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,489
wouldn't normally

48
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,609
expect for criminals to be able to get,

49
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,689
um.

50
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,698
But that kind of led what led me through my journey though.

51
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,980
So as I continued to, to get older and everything, I

52
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,019
took forensic science, you know, eventually wanted to

53
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,599
be a forensic scientist and work with law enforcement.

54
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,588
That didn't pan out the way I wanted it to.

55
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,609
I moved into the, the private sector and

56
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,510
started with my company Arria. I originally started on the phones

57
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,909
and then moved into the revenue integrity department

58
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,489
from there.

59
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,689
And for me that was kind of my calling.

60
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,049
At that point, you know,

61
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,769
yeah, I wasn't a criminal,

62
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,110
but now I was moving into a realm where I could think like

63
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,909
a criminal, act like a criminal,

64
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,308
get paid to do it, and not get in trouble

65
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:14,000
for it.

66
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,050
So, no downside.

67
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,490
So a little bit about Olivia.

68
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,439
And so we're a white label travel agency. We've been

69
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,419
around for about

70
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,788
twenty-ish plus years.

71
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,399
I I originally started out in the timeshare space

72
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,429
where if you owned a timeshare, you'd be able to trade in your

73
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:32,300
timeshare week,

74
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,669
and we would give you a cruise to go on a, a

75
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,838
nice fantastic cruise, uh, vacation.

76
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,330
Since then, you know, it's expanded, we moved into

77
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,508
being a, a full-blown travel agency

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,550
offering air, car, car, hotel, resorts,

79
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:46,500
uh,

80
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,528
everything that you can imagine under the sun as far as like vacation goes.

81
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:52,689
And from there

82
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,058
Kind of a good example of it, we moved into the, the loyalty

83
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,330
space. And

84
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:00,538
one of our partners, Spirit, so

85
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,110
we actually just brought them on super excited about that.

86
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,288
And what we do for them is we allow them to use

87
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,788
your loyalty points,

88
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,210
right? That you get from, you know, spending using your

89
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,990
spirit card.

90
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,389
When you book travel, you come into our platform.

91
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,379
I forgot what I was gonna say. Sorry. Um, so

92
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,330
you come into our platform.

93
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,349
And react as a merchant of record

94
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,349
and since we have, you know, over 2100 employees

95
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:27,000
globally,

96
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,538
that opens us up to a lot of different

97
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:30,819
levels of risk, right?

98
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:32,270
This allows, you know,

99
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,110
one of our employees could potentially, you know, use your credit

100
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,909
card information.

101
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,389
They could use your loyalty points to book their own vacations.

102
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,990
Unfortunately, yes, it does happen, but that's

103
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,750
why I exist, right, to catch these guys.

104
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,229
And with that, we have to kind of understand the fraud

105
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,229
and to be able to catch these guys, we really need to understand like how

106
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,868
do they think?

107
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,409
How do they move? What do they do? What, how are they gonna act?

108
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:56,788
Long time ago

109
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,058
A bunch of fraud fighters came up with what's called the fraud

110
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,419
triangle, and they broke it down into three components

111
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,669
of why fraud exists, why fraud

112
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:05,330
happens.

113
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,389
First one is being in the opportunity.

114
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,020
So is the opportunity present there for somebody

115
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,258
to be able to commit fraud

116
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:14,919
and that could just be, you know, maybe nobody's watching.

117
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,920
Or it could be maybe

118
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,939
you accidentally

119
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,540
did something and realized that

120
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,019
nobody caught it and so therefore, you continue

121
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,819
to do it on so on and so forth.

122
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,778
So that's where the opportunity comes in.

123
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:28,379
Motive

124
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:30,649
Motive by far is the easiest one.

125
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:32,639
Most motives is driven by

126
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,939
some type of monetary gain.

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,588
Right. Either

128
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,209
in, in our case,

129
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,608
a free vacation because you don't have enough money

130
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:41,238
to be able to,

131
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:42,949
to pay for your own vacation.

132
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,329
Uh, maybe you're gonna sell something, which I'll talk

133
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,509
about here in a, a little bit.

134
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,730
But there's some, there's always some kind of drive to it

135
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,009
like nobody just, you know, suddenly wakes up and says, I'm

136
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,129
gonna commit fraud just because, right? There's

137
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,129
always something there to it.

138
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,238
Lastly is the rationalization of it.

139
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,559
And this is actually kind of the, the most

140
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,319
interesting part. Um.

141
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,639
I don't know

142
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,069
if too many people are aware of, um,

143
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,790
a guy used to be called Tipper X.

144
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,350
He did an insider trading, uh, fraud

145
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,858
scheme.

146
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,100
Uh, way back when,

147
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,608
but I got to listen to him talk. And one of the things that he said is,

148
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,019
He rationalized his fraud

149
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,079
by saying it was a victimless crime,

150
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,079
right? There was no victim in this.

151
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,449
And I really paid attention to that.

152
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,338
And as I've interviewed some of the people at our company

153
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,338
that we've identified the internal fraud with,

154
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,769
you know, I, I asked them, you know, why did you guys do it?

155
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,790
And a lot of times they say the same thing.

156
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,678
We felt like it was gonna be victimless,

157
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,600
right? The, the company has enough money to cover this,

158
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,338
you know, if we use a customer's benefits,

159
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:46,738
the company's gonna pay for that like it's gonna go

160
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,278
back to them. They're not out anything.

161
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,428
But there's to us there is no victim.

162
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,209
Other times we do hear the whole piece of

163
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,048
well it's owed to me,

164
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,629
you know, I, I work really hard. I

165
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,639
feel underappreciated at my company,

166
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,850
so

167
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,629
I'm rationalizing me doing this action

168
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:06,209
because

169
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,428
I feel like it's owed to me by the company.

170
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,850
So

171
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,338
Getting into the meat and potatoes of everything, like how do we

172
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,678
get connected with Terra Mind?

173
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,069
So we're actually doing an investigation.

174
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,358
That was actually completely separate for the reason why we actually

175
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:28,738
linked up with Terramine.

176
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,579
Uh, so we're going through an investigation where we noticed

177
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,579
that there had been some fraudulent hotel bookings made

178
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,338
on a bunch of members' accounts.

179
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,778
And as we're going through it,

180
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:40,399
we're looking through everything that we're going into our CRM

181
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,399
and looking at, you know, the actions that have taken place in the

182
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:42,980
CRM

183
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,500
we noticed that.

184
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,509
A couple of agents' names are on.

185
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,678
Changes within the accounts like they were changing the

186
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,720
names that were on the accounts or changing phone numbers or

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,959
changing email addresses.

188
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,769
They're changing a bunch of information to kind of hide

189
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:57,649
what they were doing.

190
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,199
So we brought those folks in and said, hey, listen,

191
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,329
like, So the members are

192
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,420
called in, they say they don't recognize the people that have made these

193
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,019
bookings.

194
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,709
They didn't use the points.

195
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,879
What's going on? Why is your name all over these accounts?

196
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:13,829
First thing they said was, well,

197
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,528
we shared our passwords with other people,

198
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:19,019
which I mean, if you're in IT or cybersecurity,

199
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,350
that's a huge no no, right? Like you don't

200
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,209
share your credentials with anybody.

201
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,670
And so we obviously, we told them they're like,

202
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,709
hey, like what are you doing? Like you can't share your

203
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,119
credentials. Like that's just,

204
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,250
why would you do that? Now look what's happened.

205
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:33,548
Even though you shared your credentials and you're saying it's

206
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,750
not you, you're still responsible because it's under your

207
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,879
name. As they heard

208
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,629
that, well,

209
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,199
they do like, you know, most thieves do, you know, no

210
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,399
honor amongst thieves. They started throwing everybody under

211
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,019
the bus.

212
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,699
It was this person. It was that person.

213
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,079
This person did it over here. Yes, I might have done

214
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,338
this one, but they're the ones that told me how to do this.

215
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,509
It was just left and right.

216
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,028
But they did throw out one name that seemed to be really

217
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,928
interesting, and so we started digging into that person.

218
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,470
And as we're looking into it.

219
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,329
We noticed that this individual had a high number

220
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,569
of views on accounts.

221
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:07,459
All right, so we're going through, you know, some of our

222
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,509
information from the, the data warehouse and everything to, to

223
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:10,509
pull this up and we're like,

224
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,910
Man, why does she have almost

225
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,108
10 times, 20 times most other

226
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,889
agents for views on accounts?

227
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,709
Like this doesn't make sense.

228
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:21,858
And

229
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,059
keep in mind,

230
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,379
she got thrown into the mix because of this hotel

231
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,059
booking piece.

232
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,139
As we're looking at it, we're also noticing there's

233
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,720
no hotel bookings. There's no

234
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,038
any travel booked on these accounts.

235
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,369
What is going on? Like, why?

236
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,658
And as we continue to go through it and continue to dig

237
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:42,388
through it, We

238
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,928
started assuming why

239
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:45,508
this was going on.

240
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:47,668
But we couldn't really prove it.

241
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,979
And what we assumed was going on

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,359
was that this person was building lead lists,

243
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,960
and they were going to then sell these lead lists

244
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,779
to another party.

245
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,889
I will say this was in our, our Mexico

246
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,009
office. And

247
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:06,109
one thing that Mexico is known for is

248
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,389
cartels.

249
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,349
And what we've learned is

250
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,359
What the cartels were actually doing down in Mexico

251
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,340
is they would approach

252
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,759
some of the timeshares down there, call centers down

253
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,440
there. They would approach employees

254
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,158
and offering them cash to build

255
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:24,200
lead lists for them.

256
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,168
And typically every lead, like lead

257
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,489
that they had, they would give, you know, maybe 50 cents,

258
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,649
right? Maybe $1 for like every lead that

259
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,690
they got. But

260
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,769
then they would call these leads, the cartel folks would call

261
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:36,288
these leads.

262
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,548
And this is actually um

263
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,210
Found this out through the FBI that

264
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,460
This is actually one of the top ways that cartels

265
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,000
make money currently,

266
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,119
is by doing this scam where

267
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,500
they call out to you and say, hey,

268
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,739
If you want to get out of your timeshare, we're gonna buy it for you.

269
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,729
We'll pay you $100,000 150,000

270
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,908
dollars to sell your timeshare to us.

271
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,168
You're free of it. You don't have to worry about it

272
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,210
anymore. And

273
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,548
you get to make some money.

274
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:07,830
That sounds like a good deal, right?

275
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,489
I mean, a lot of these people probably purchased their timeshares around

276
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,928
like $50,000 maybe $60,000

277
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,509
right? So they're coming out way ahead.

278
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,279
So they're like, yeah, you know,

279
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,940
I do, I want to do it. I want to do that.

280
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,538
And then what they say is, well,

281
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,840
There is a fee for this. Think of it like a closing

282
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,710
cost fee, like when you're buying a house, right?

283
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,399
So there's a fee for this. Usually they start about like $5000.

284
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:31,700
And

285
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,820
So you say, OK, that's fine, right?

286
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,788
You know, I'm fine with paying that. You're gonna give me 100,000.

287
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:39,070
You know, sometimes they'd even sweeten it up and say, you know, we'll

288
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,408
give you that 5000 back.

289
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:43,168
You know, so instead of getting 100,000, you're gonna get 105,000

290
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,308
back. So yeah, you're like,

291
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,450
all right, cool. I'll, I'll give you that $5000.

292
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,599
A couple of weeks goes down the road,

293
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,950
you hear back from him again, hey, there were some issues, you

294
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,928
know, with the government.

295
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,168
There are some additional fees to this.

296
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:57,940
We need more money.

297
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,219
And they keep doing this cycle

298
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,450
until that person finally says,

299
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:04,950
all right, I have no more money or I'm

300
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,519
now realizing that this is a scam.

301
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,418
Usually it's done over wire, so it's not as very easy to

302
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,298
be like, hey, I'm just gonna charge this back.

303
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,239
Like once that money's gone, it's gone,

304
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,918
right? So

305
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,729
That timeshare owner now very upset,

306
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,269
understandably, right? I mean, they just got bilked out of

307
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,529
thousands of dollars. They got nothing

308
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,619
for it. So they're

309
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,320
very upset

310
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,869
So what does the cartel cartel do then?

311
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:30,629
They circle back to that person.

312
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,538
And they say, hey,

313
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,359
we found your information. There was a, a scam

314
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,580
call center that was raided.

315
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,639
Your information was in there.

316
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:41,190
We're gonna help you get it back.

317
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,538
And he used to be like, hey, yeah, I want my money back.

318
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:48,178
Like, whatever you gotta do. And they're pretty sophisticated

319
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:48,779
with this.

320
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:49,879
They create

321
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,418
fake IDs like fake lawyer IDs and

322
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,340
everything. They have fake government documents.

323
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,288
They have fake telephone numbers that if you

324
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,399
call up, like they'll answer, you know, this is illegal,

325
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,710
so and so, blah, blah, blah.

326
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,239
But they go through all that with you and like you get really excited.

327
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,440
OK, I'm gonna get my money back. I'm, I'm gonna get some kind

328
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,979
of justice.

329
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,229
And then they hit you with a

330
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,558
Well, there's a, there's a government fee for this.

331
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,279
So now you got to pay us more money.

332
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,668
So they're just going through these people and just cycling

333
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,739
back and, and going through and going through and going through and just

334
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,210
like getting more and more money, right?

335
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,210
And so that's what our fear was with this

336
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,320
person. Going through all of

337
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,109
these accounts.

338
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:33,168
But we had no way to really truly prove it, right?

339
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,460
We just had conjecture. Like all, all we could think

340
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,168
of was like,

341
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,690
yeah, we assume that you're doing it and you know what

342
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,849
they say about assuming, right?

343
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,538
So all we could do is assume.

344
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,000
Now in Mexico,

345
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,379
they have very different labor laws.

346
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,678
You can't just terminate somebody without cause.

347
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,080
Like, even though we felt we had cause, but if we couldn't prove

348
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,519
it, that's technically without cause.

349
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:56,099
And if we were to term them,

350
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,820
we either have to pay out a very heavy severance

351
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:01,479
or they could potentially turn around and sue us,

352
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:03,658
and then we would end up paying out a lot of money.

353
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,889
So the last thing that we wanna do is pay a fraudster

354
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,349
money to get them out of our system, right?

355
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:10,408
Um.

356
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,129
And so we're just like, OK, we can't do that, and we're just

357
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,469
like this says, you know, hitting a wall. No, we were banging our

358
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:18,469
heads against the wall trying to figure out like how

359
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:19,570
do we do this, right?

360
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,219
Cause there was a lot of accounts that this person

361
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,129
was going through.

362
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,428
We're really trying to figure it out. So we reached out to our cybersecurity

363
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:27,788
department and our IT department,

364
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,308
which, by the way, if I have any cybersecurity folks

365
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:31,989
in here or IT folks.

366
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,918
If you guys have a CFE at your company or

367
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:35,950
internal auditors,

368
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,259
I highly encourage you guys to actually get with them

369
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,918
and meet with them because that synergy

370
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,000
between both groups can actually do like a

371
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,418
whole lot of good damage within the company to actually

372
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:47,080
prevent insider threat.

373
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,690
But we reached out to them and we do work with them quite,

374
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,759
quite closely.

375
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,619
And we're asking them, you know, can you guys pull us down all the

376
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,619
team's messages? We need, you know,

377
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,519
this person's

378
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,940
Outlook inbox. We need you to pull

379
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,099
their OneDrive.

380
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:03,969
Which that part was gonna be a nightmare. I don't know if anybody's

381
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,219
ever had to sift through hundreds of Excel

382
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:07,038
documents

383
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,619
to look through data and find hidden data

384
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,719
and all that stuff. It's terrible

385
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,158
and it takes forever.

386
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:14,538
Um

387
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,979
And so we weren't really looking forward to that, but we

388
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:18,719
needed the information.

389
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:21,519
Downside was,

390
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,149
this was going to take time.

391
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,928
Right, like this wasn't gonna be a quick thing. It was

392
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:28,418
probably gonna take at least 2 weeks to get the data.

393
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,250
Probably another week to go

394
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,288
through it all and sift through it all and get, find the evidence

395
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,389
that we actually need

396
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,009
and then go and interview the person

397
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,960
again to show them all the, the information.

398
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,340
By that time, this lead list could be gone,

399
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:44,288
right? And we're talking this is a large lead list, not

400
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,428
something we'd want to get out.

401
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,619
So we're just like, all right, like how do, how can we speed this up?

402
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,678
How can we speed this up?

403
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,229
And this is where we got introduced to terramine.

404
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:55,450
We had one of our guys who worked in our workforce management

405
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,509
department. And he

406
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,859
came to us and we'd reached out to him on during this

407
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,649
investigation for much for some other stuff.

408
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:03,779
And he came to us and said, hey, like,

409
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,428
I heard you guys are a little bit stuck.

410
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,369
We're piloting this program.

411
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,849
It's called TerraMind.

412
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,840
And it's a soft, it's a

413
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,330
computer monitoring software.

414
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,269
Like, would you guys be interested in taking a look at it?

415
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,989
Like, yes, yes, we would.

416
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:21,619
And so

417
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,048
they brought us into the loop on this, but they gave us one

418
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,869
caveat.

419
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:25,908
They said,

420
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,340
We only have this on 20 people.

421
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:32,139
So we have 2100 employees.

422
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,509
They're only doing this on 20 people, and we need to

423
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,489
find one person.

424
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,288
Our odds were very, very low.

425
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,229
But

426
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,149
We struck gold.

427
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:47,190
That one person who had been on there, that one person

428
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,168
was part of the pilot.

429
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,440
So once we got access to the tool, that was the first thing we looked

430
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,340
for, like, is this person here? We're like, yes,

431
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,460
we have it.

432
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:56,298
And then we started digging into the tool.

433
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,558
And I'm not kidding when I say, like,

434
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,529
this was literally like having God mode in a video game.

435
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,619
We could see everything that this person was

436
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:05,580
doing on their computer.

437
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,298
We're looking at different times where

438
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,769
She probably had her child on there and it was like they

439
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:13,058
were playing Roblox,

440
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,729
watching Disney movies, things like that. We're

441
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,808
like, and we can see all this like

442
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,889
we're playing as a like as it's

443
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:20,969
our own screen, right?

444
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,788
On top of that, we have all the other data in there.

445
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,210
So we can identify

446
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,788
every single application, every

447
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:28,629
single website,

448
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,269
how long they were on the website for.

449
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,379
And we started piecing all those together and we started looking at

450
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:35,918
when they were accessing the CRM.

451
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,779
You know, a lot of the access was after hours,

452
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:41,200
which was, again, you know, one of our first clues that

453
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,619
something nefarious was going on.

454
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,219
And we started going in there, and we're able to actually sit

455
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:48,000
there and watch this employee.

456
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,099
Go into the account.

457
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,649
Sit there for a few seconds.

458
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,940
Copy the, the PII information,

459
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,418
go into Excel and paste it into Excel.

460
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:02,719
And we watched them do this multiple

461
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,259
times.

462
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,578
We actually got to see this employee also get a little

463
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,519
bit trickier too,

464
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,939
which would have made my life so much more difficult if

465
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,559
I had to go through all these Excel files.

466
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,568
She would not only copy and paste it into there,

467
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,989
she would change the font to white.

468
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:21,410
So that way it looked like nothing was in any of the cells.

469
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,630
And then she would hide the tab.

470
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,880
The likelihood of us finding that right

471
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,049
away, very slim.

472
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,640
Like we would obviously notice that the Excel file has a

473
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,180
large like file size,

474
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,299
so there's gotta be some kind of data there.

475
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,900
But to dig through that.

476
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,680
I actually find that off of the OneDrive.

477
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,459
would have taken forever.

478
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,078
You know, I'm very confident in my skills. I, I do a pretty

479
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,250
good job. But that would have taken me forever

480
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,489
if I didn't have this, right?

481
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:53,309
So this also helped us with our, our IT

482
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,750
department, right? Cause now we knew what Excel

483
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,630
file it was.

484
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:59,529
So now we can say, hey, we need these files. Don't

485
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:00,680
give me the whole hard drive.

486
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:02,900
Just give me these files.

487
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:05,608
So what would it take in, you know,

488
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:08,309
3 to 4 weeks to fully investigate

489
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,949
and handle with the, the employee?

490
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:12,789
Now it took us about 2 days to do.

491
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:15,529
Thankfully,

492
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,598
With this, we're actually able to stop

493
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,009
the file from even being sent out.

494
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,568
We're actually able to go back and see when she first

495
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,568
started. So the time that we

496
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:26,309
got rid of her.

497
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,189
And we're able to identify that the file never

498
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,229
got sent out. So we're actually able to

499
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:32,750
protect the data.

500
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,949
Which was for us, that's a game changer, right?

501
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,430
From a, a fraud perspective, being able to see

502
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,289
this information

503
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,729
is major.

504
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,410
Like David said, you know,

505
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,989
right at the beginning, you know, 83% of companies

506
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,049
are going to

507
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,630
experience some type of internal threat.

508
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,900
The majority of that when you're talking about fraud,

509
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,729
either doesn't get caught.

510
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,209
Or

511
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,539
gets caught months down the road,

512
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,269
usually by accident.

513
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,390
Right? It's usually because

514
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,949
your consumer called in.

515
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,059
And said he was upset because something, you know, happened

516
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:07,719
on their account,

517
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,259
or somebody else, you know, came across it

518
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:10,920
by accident.

519
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,189
So now we're moving into a completely different realm,

520
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:16,858
being able to actually see these screens.

521
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,250
Now we're getting into a realm where we can actually go in

522
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,160
and be more proactive about

523
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
preventing fraud, preventing,

524
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,328
protecting our data,

525
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,660
and keeping our systems more secure.

526
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:35,140
So what we did is once we saw this

527
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,338
information, And we realized how

528
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:38,469
powerful it was

529
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:40,420
and I look at everything that we could see. Like I said,

530
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,779
you can see applications, you can see the websites, we

531
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,519
can see IP information,

532
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,500
uh, really cool, my favorite functionality

533
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,000
OCR so we can actually

534
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:51,420
put things into a search and we can see if it popped

535
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,539
up on their screen at all.

536
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:53,479
So that

537
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,279
takes some of our investigations down

538
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:56,739
drastically.

539
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,059
Also helps with link analysis. We can stick like

540
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,519
a, a member ID into there

541
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:02,979
and we see all the different employees that maybe

542
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:05,180
have accessed that account. Maybe they didn't actually go into

543
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,279
the account. But it appeared

544
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,338
somewhere on the screen, either through an Excel file.

545
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:11,430
Um,

546
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,019
they accessed the front portion of the

547
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,529
account without actually going into it.

548
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,838
They were talking about it within a team's message.

549
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,618
So now we can see that and we can start grouping together like

550
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:22,709
anybody that may have access to the account. So if fraud

551
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,269
did occur,

552
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,858
now we can see everybody that may potentially

553
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:26,559
be involved.

554
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,309
So with that we, we took that on we said,

555
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,689
you know what, they're, they're piloting this and they've been,

556
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,750
you know, I think probably like 6 or 7

557
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,750
months already in the works of, of doing this we're

558
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,000
like, nope, we need this now.

559
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,449
So we took it over

560
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,368
and within about another 6 months we scaled it up to

561
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,828
1500 employees.

562
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:48,039
Now, why 1500 when we have 2100?

563
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:50,239
One of the key reasons being

564
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,049
Different laws and different geos

565
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:54,390
like Portugal,

566
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:57,430
you can't monitor somebody's computer 24/7.

567
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:00,549
So we have to continuously rotate them, them

568
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,709
in and out. So there's no sense in buying licenses

569
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:03,239
to

570
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,469
Have there for somebody that we're not monitoring, right?

571
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:10,809
But we continue to build that out.

572
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,979
Now, for us, yeah, again.

573
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,299
World's greatest tool, right?

574
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,318
Like I said, we can see everything.

575
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,400
But that does come with challenges.

576
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,118
Right, not everybody's gonna want to adopt that.

577
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,699
Now for our department we reported up

578
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,880
in through the sales organization which

579
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,279
was a very weird

580
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,318
organizational structure for for us tore through sales

581
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,519
but that's the way that we reported so

582
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,140
that wasn't that big of a push on that side but going into

583
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,039
the corporate world.

584
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,140
And on the corporate side of everything.

585
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,299
Became a little bit harder,

586
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,969
right? Because not everybody wanted

587
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:52,009
to be monitored, you know, everybody had that sense of,

588
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:54,009
OK, Big Brother is going to be watching us.

589
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,019
You know, now we're gonna get micromanaged,

590
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:58,479
yada yada yada.

591
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,019
So we really had to work to overcome that.

592
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,818
And some of the other concerns were, you know,

593
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:05,400
if I'm in marketing.

594
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,818
And so if I'm in the SLT for marketing,

595
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,779
I don't want

596
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,380
somebody from development looking at my people.

597
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,479
Or if I have 2 managers, I don't want

598
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,229
1 manager

599
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,000
being able to see the other manager's department, then they start bickering

600
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,289
back and forth at each other because the other person's

601
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,049
employees aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing.

602
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,930
So we had to go in and to

603
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:28,420
Set it up in such a way that

604
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:31,000
Everybody could only see their people,

605
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:33,598
right? So we had to alleviate that

606
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:35,650
concern. The

607
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,608
other concerns that started coming up were.

608
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,559
HIPAA and PCI compliance issues,

609
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,150
right? Cause we're now we're, we're monitoring the computer.

610
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,108
How many of you, you know, do like your

611
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:48,489
healthcare and stuff like that on your work computer?

612
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,779
I know I do because it's the easiest and it's tied to my,

613
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:52,469
my work email, right?

614
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,489
So we had to worry about that. So we'll block out

615
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:57,519
email. PCI, you know,

616
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,199
will block out payment screens.

617
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,368
And so we had to do a, a lot to really

618
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:04,189
kind of build that trust with everybody that

619
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,529
we're not gonna be looking at sensitive information.

620
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,309
We're not gonna be using that, that information in any

621
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:10,729
sort of shape or form.

622
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:14,608
We also created a, a governance

623
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,670
committee. To also kind

624
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,910
of help manage this.

625
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:20,189
So when we do investigations.

626
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,098
We'll have to go to this government governance committee.

627
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:25,750
And say, hey,

628
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,568
we need to move this person to what we call special

629
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:30,689
projects. And what that does

630
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:32,969
is now again, like I said, we, we're blocking

631
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:35,239
out payment screens, we're blocking out

632
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,289
email, we're moving in the special projects and

633
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,640
that kind of opens it up for us during our

634
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,559
investigation so we can see what's going on in those,

635
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:42,608
those realms.

636
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:45,189
Number one, that helps us not bug IT

637
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,250
to go pull down Outlook and Teams messages

638
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,068
and all that stuff.

639
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,118
But it also gives us just a full scope within

640
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:52,439
one system to be able to do it.

641
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,920
But we have to go through this governance committee, which

642
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,160
again helps kind of build that trust with

643
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,229
everybody. We also

644
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,348
communicate out to the company, you know, and I'm

645
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:03,239
sure a lot of your companies do this as well.

646
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,130
We'll let you know that your

647
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,170
computer is being monitored.

648
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,608
Now, we don't necessarily tell you exactly the full scope of how

649
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:11,529
it's being monitored, but it's being monitored.

650
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,750
So with all that, that kinda helped alleviate

651
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,868
some of the grumblings. I mean they're still there and they're

652
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,269
always gonna be there again because nobody wants to be monitored

653
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:21,108
and stuff like that.

654
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,828
But once we started really digging through it and going through it and

655
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:25,989
explaining it to people and then what the full capabilities

656
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:28,068
were, people really started to uh

657
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,088
to adopt that.

658
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,729
And some of those other pieces were, you know, positive

659
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:33,489
use cases.

660
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,880
Again, for me, yeah, I use it for fraud.

661
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,209
90% of my use of this tool is going to

662
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,250
be for some kind of negative reason because somebody's

663
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,868
doing something they shouldn't be doing

664
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:44,529
and now I need to go after them for, you

665
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:45,828
know, whatever it is that they're doing.

666
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:48,449
But as we went through this, we did start noticing

667
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,618
a lot of positive use cases for this.

668
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:54,838
One of those use cases being like for productivity.

669
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,299
One of the real strong ones that we

670
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,618
still continue to, to use today and, and

671
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:01,539
go through is

672
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,479
helping with our service levels.

673
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,219
We started noticing when we went in there that agents

674
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:07,598
would be key pressing,

675
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:10,400
right? It's, it's a fake kind of being active

676
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,000
and.

677
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,469
Whatever, keeping their computers awake.

678
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:16,318
And we started noticing this like quite a bit. Now

679
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:18,338
we did have some people doing it for nefarious reasons

680
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,739
because they were trying to avoid work

681
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,269
and you know we, we handled that. But the other

682
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,519
thing that we noticed is we had a lot of

683
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,779
employees that were just pressing on keys.

684
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:30,068
Because they didn't have enough calls. They didn't have enough

685
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,088
work. And

686
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:34,289
you know they'd be 2030, 40

687
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:35,789
minutes in between calls.

688
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,430
But then we look at some of the other departments

689
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,088
and they were just back to back calls,

690
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:43,559
you know, sometimes 10 minute wait times, 20

691
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,469
minute wait times.

692
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,640
And so what we started doing

693
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,608
The apartments that had, you know, the lower call volumes,

694
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,108
like in their mind, they're like, OK, we're overstaffed.

695
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:54,430
So we're gonna start reducing heads.

696
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:57,630
And we were looking, I was like, well, no, like, don't do

697
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,199
that. Let's reskill these individuals

698
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,848
to go into like these heavier call volume

699
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:03,709
areas.

700
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,920
And so that was like one of the big, you know, use cases

701
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,239
right there because not only did

702
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,068
that give employees the ability to

703
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,618
number one, not be bored,

704
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:15,059
give them the ability to sell more which

705
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,170
improved their commissions, right?

706
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,759
Which from my side that reduces the risk of

707
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,959
those employees committing fraud because now they're making more

708
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,229
money. Helped our service

709
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:24,799
levels.

710
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,709
With the, as far as the the calls went, which

711
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,469
put us in a better position with our brand partners.

712
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,439
So we were using it, you know, to kind of

713
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:34,828
go through some of that.

714
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,739
The other things that we would use it for is like we look at

715
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,479
some of our top producers

716
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,880
and we have one in in particular and

717
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,180
this guy is like an absolute beast when it

718
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,279
comes to sales like he's been like the top guy

719
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,939
for I don't even know how many years running

720
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:50,259
like nobody's been able to to outsell this guy

721
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,400
like he's always been the top.

722
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:53,949
But nobody really understood how he did it.

723
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,529
So we actually started watching him and we took the,

724
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,549
his video screen through Terramine,

725
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,000
and we matched that up to his calls.

726
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:04,598
Now this guy was very methodical.

727
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,338
He always said the exact same thing, exact same

728
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,039
jokes.

729
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,098
All the way through his calls, every single call, the exact

730
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,578
same, and it worked.

731
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
But we also when we start looking at the screen in

732
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,410
TerraMind,

733
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,078
we started noticing his patterns within

734
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:21,500
as he's actually moving through our applications

735
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,180
we would notice that

736
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,838
he would always go into the application

737
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:28,098
before he actually needed to get into it.

738
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,559
He already knew what he was gonna say so he can move very

739
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,358
quickly through it.

740
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,539
And we started looking at, you know, some of the lower performers,

741
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:36,219
and what we noticed is

742
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:39,078
a lot of them as they were going through their calls.

743
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:41,750
They'd be trying to pull up the application.

744
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:44,400
As they needed it instead of beforehand.

745
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,920
So and as we know with technology,

746
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,299
sometimes it's not the quickest thing in the world, especially

747
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:50,180
when it's web-based.

748
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,170
So we have these lower performers trying to pull something

749
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,469
up and while it's loading,

750
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,098
They don't know how to fill that silence.

751
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,420
Right, so they're just a lots of ums and

752
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,348
ah or just dead silence,

753
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:05,019
which I mean, in a, in a sales world

754
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,078
that's gonna kill

755
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,680
your sales call,

756
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,219
right? Like you don't want silence in there. You wanna be able

757
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:11,719
to continuously interacting.

758
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,858
So we identified that and we started building SOPs

759
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,858
on how to navigate through calls

760
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:17,789
and how to

761
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,039
Be more productive in your sales calls.

762
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:25,459
Flipping kind of back to the fraud side,

763
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,799
some of the positive use cases that we've been using for

764
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,420
this, we've also used it to

765
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,219
prove people innocent.

766
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,160
We actually had one case where

767
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:36,789
Uh one of our members called in.

768
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:39,279
They had just purchased a membership through us, a travel

769
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,459
membership. Shortly

770
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,358
after that purchase,

771
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,660
his credit card, credit card got used at a

772
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,779
Target. So he

773
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,900
called in saying, I've never used this credit

774
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,160
card except for with you guys.

775
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,779
Now it's been used at Target.

776
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,279
Your employee took my credit card information.

777
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:59,368
So we're actually able to go through.

778
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,108
And what we did is, again, we pulled up the phone

779
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,118
calls. We

780
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:04,959
pulled up Terrain.

781
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,750
Matched the screen up to the call.

782
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:10,529
First thing that we did is we looked at when the payment

783
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:11,250
information was taken.

784
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:13,209
So on the call, we can hear,

785
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,390
or I shouldn't say we can hear cause we, we do block that out for PCI

786
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,500
as well. But we know exactly when he's

787
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,750
giving the credit card information. We know how long it usually

788
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,269
takes somebody to give a credit card.

789
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,000
Matched it up to the screen.

790
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,250
And when as we walked to the screen, we could see him.

791
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:31,219
Entering into the payment field again it's blacked out

792
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,539
on there, but we can see how long that he's in there for,

793
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,910
right? He was in there just long enough to

794
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,910
enter in the credit card information and then

795
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,189
he exited out of it.

796
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,640
Now with our systems it automatically red

797
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,289
redacts the credit card information,

798
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,189
so there's no way for that employee to ever go back in

799
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:48,229
there and resee that credit card information.

800
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:49,969
So right there we knew.

801
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:53,150
The likelihood of him having written it down was very

802
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,189
slim to none. If he would have written it down, what we would

803
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:55,959
have seen is

804
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,269
We have heard in the call

805
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:01,039
where I blanked out for the credit card information.

806
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:04,279
But during that time, we would have seen, you know,

807
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,479
his screen not necessarily blanked out.

808
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,430
And then him going in and finally entering the credit

809
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,430
card information and going on from there. Like it wouldn't have

810
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,670
been a simultaneous thing if he was writing it down.

811
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
No, that's not to say that, you know, maybe he didn't, you

812
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,189
know, record it somehow or something like

813
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,358
that on his phone or something like a voice

814
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:22,140
recorder or whatever.

815
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,739
Very possible, but

816
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,719
unlikely.

817
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,039
So we're able to use that information.

818
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,348
The other piece that we actually use and we compared this to some

819
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,739
of our other information, we use the IP

820
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:34,588
address information.

821
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,150
So Termline gives us that information, tells us where somebody's

822
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,828
located at.

823
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,400
And we're able to look at it and say, OK.

824
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:44,279
Based on Termine's information plus our own internal

825
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,289
information. This

826
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:48,118
individual is located in this area.

827
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,180
Now the store that it was used at was 4

828
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,000
hours away.

829
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:57,039
Now, why you would drive 4 hours to go use a stolen

830
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:57,989
credit card, I don't know.

831
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,130
You might, right?

832
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,598
But not likely.

833
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,719
From there, what we also did is we said, OK,

834
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,818
we know that this is where he's located at.

835
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,170
The day that the card was used,

836
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,689
we went into her mind and looked down that specific day,

837
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,509
and that employee was working that day.

838
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:16,989
Called up Target. We got all the information.

839
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,479
Target confirmed that the card had been swiped.

840
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,868
They gave us a time stamp of when it was done.

841
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,059
And it was 2 hours before the employee shift.

842
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,838
No way that employee is swiping that card in,

843
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,160
and that target and then making it all the way back and on

844
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,189
time for a shift.

845
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:34,519
So we're actually able to take that information,

846
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,979
use the screen recordings from Terramine,

847
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:37,979
and

848
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,098
talk to the cardholder and say, hey,

849
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,890
our employee did not take your credit card

850
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,598
information. Again

851
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:47,588
Without the use of being able to see that, it would have been very

852
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,709
tough for us to be able to handle that situation.

853
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:53,338
Because then we're like one of those situations you kind of have to side

854
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:55,509
with that member, right? Like you don't really wanna

855
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,400
upset your member too much, so

856
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:00,299
potentially could have had to have like at least the very

857
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,699
least suspended this employee until we finished our

858
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,699
investigation by using this tool we were

859
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,799
actually able to resolve it same day.

860
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,259
I think once we did, I think we did it probably

861
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:09,959
about 2 hours

862
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:13,489
from the time that the member called to resolving

863
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:15,088
and then getting back on the phone with the member.

864
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:17,449
But like I said,

865
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:20,019
lots of positive use cases for this. I

866
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,318
honestly, I'd probably go on for days with all the different use

867
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,239
positive use cases that we can do from this.

868
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:28,549
But some of the other fun things that we've come across,

869
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,189
uh, from my side of it

870
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,789
is

871
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,529
just random weird things that I don't

872
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,209
even know why some of the employees would do this,

873
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:37,930
like fraudulent sick leave.

874
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,118
Like, we caught one person that

875
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:41,858
was

876
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,410
calling out sick,

877
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,549
but they were going into their computer, they were

878
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:46,969
purchasing their hotel

879
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,219
booking

880
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,559
on their computer so we could see them purchasing it for the

881
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,078
days that they called out sick.

882
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,439
So they're really just going on vacation.

883
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:57,608
But they didn't want to go through the proper steps of

884
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,130
requesting the time off and making sure that it was actually approved

885
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,289
and doing all that. They just said, you know what, I'm

886
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,309
going on vacation

887
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:05,269
and I'm just gonna do it.

888
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,469
So that was a, that was a fun one to do.

889
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,930
Uh, fake system issues.

890
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:13,380
So this is where from an IT perspective,

891
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,838
uh, Terramine gets really interesting as well, kind

892
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:17,900
of going back to some of those positive use cases,

893
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,239
uh, with the fake system issues.

894
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:22,449
Agents will call up and say, hey,

895
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:25,029
our telephones, my telephone system, it

896
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:27,549
crashed, and that's why, you know, I keep getting disconnected

897
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,680
from members and you know I'm having all these problems.

898
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,410
And we'll go in and we'll look at it and be like.

899
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,640
No, you hit the disconnect button

900
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
repeatedly on every single one of these customers, like you

901
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,598
had zero issues.

902
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:41,118
But on the flip side of that, we do, like I said, going

903
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,289
back to the positive use case,

904
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:43,828
we do allow our IT,

905
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:45,759
um,

906
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,660
employees to actually use this system as well to

907
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,598
help troubleshoot

908
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:52,380
some of these issues, right, if, if it's a legitimate

909
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,779
issue. Being in the IT world,

910
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,779
having to reproduce an issue.

911
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:01,118
It is difficult sometimes, right? Especially

912
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:02,380
when you're dealing with, you know,

913
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,439
either sales agents or people who aren't very tech savvy.

914
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,838
It gets kind of difficult because you're like, OK, I need

915
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,860
to know how to reproduce this. What were you doing

916
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,958
before, during, and after when this

917
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,688
issue occurred,

918
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,119
right? A lot of times they're like, I have no idea what I

919
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,800
was doing, but I just know that it crashed.

920
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,208
And sometimes it's, you know, a day or two later when they're

921
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,059
just like, oh yeah, by the way, I had this issue,

922
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,300
right? So as an IT person, you're like.

923
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,179
I have no way to reproduce this, and when I try

924
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,179
to do the steps that you told me, it's working

925
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:29,860
fine for me.

926
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:33,300
So with this tool, what they can actually go in

927
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,429
and do is now look at that individual and they can

928
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,849
say, oh,

929
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,929
here's what happened. Here's where everything was going on.

930
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,550
Here's the error message that popped up for you.

931
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:44,269
And better yet,

932
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,800
Terramine gives you the time stamp of

933
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,159
when it occurred. So now you can actually take that time stamp

934
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,500
and go back into your system logs

935
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,878
to get a better understanding on the back end of why this

936
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:56,099
error actually occurred to actually resolve it.

937
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,599
You know, with that, that's another way that you can also

938
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,878
build trust with the employees, right? Cause there's nothing

939
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:03,139
worse than when employees are reporting issues.

940
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,800
And

941
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:07,300
IT looks at it and says I can't reproduce this. I don't,

942
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:08,719
doesn't look like there's an issue,

943
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,418
and they keep reporting it and they keep getting no help.

944
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,559
So with this

945
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,418
now the IT folks are actually able to get in there and

946
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,458
fix these issues and which makes the employees

947
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:21,840
happy. The

948
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,110
Last one, manipulating time tracking.

949
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,800
So we had an individual

950
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,119
that was going through and

951
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,429
She would leave work early,

952
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,039
you know, sometimes 23 hours early,

953
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,820
go pick up her daughter from school or whatever

954
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,000
she needed to do, or go run her errands, get

955
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,958
back to her house.

956
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,878
When it was time for her to be off work,

957
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,239
she would then

958
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,898
clock out, you know,

959
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:48,300
via either her cell phone or some other

960
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,059
personal device, which we don't track those,

961
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,860
uh, so we have no idea to be able to say

962
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
for sure exactly what device she was using, but we know

963
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,320
it wasn't her work computer to clock out.

964
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,110
And then she'd also come in late,

965
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:02,708
but somehow she'd always be clocked in on time.

966
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,010
But then not show up for, you know, 1 hour or 2 hours

967
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,050
into the office.

968
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,228
So we started looking into it and what we started noticing

969
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:10,789
is.

970
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:13,789
She was just manipulating her time.

971
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:17,119
She would leave work early, sometimes she'd even

972
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,280
forget. And then she would reach out to her supervisor

973
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,438
and have her supervisor actually change her

974
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:22,369
time card for her.

975
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,739
So that way she would get paid for her full hours.

976
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,889
So again, without the use of, you know,

977
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:31,530
this type of tool like we would never would have really truly

978
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,789
caught that. It would have looked weird to us.

979
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,728
I mean go back and we could look at cameras and things like that

980
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,860
to start piecing it together,

981
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,550
but. Again, that would have

982
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,599
taken so much more time. This, this way we're able

983
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,760
to look at it very quickly.

984
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:46,668
Knock it out, have the discussion, correct the

985
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:48,688
behavior, and we be able to move

986
00:36:48,688 --> 00:36:49,489
forward from there.

987
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,010
All right. And then lastly here.

988
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,849
You know, some of the, the, the key takeaways for

989
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:59,418
us. Um,

990
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,800
#1, behavioral analytics

991
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,289
are absolutely 100%

992
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:04,898
essential.

993
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,360
Understanding what your employees are doing,

994
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,800
how they're doing it, and why they're doing it

995
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,938
is just an absolute

996
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,599
essential need that every company should have.

997
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,369
Employee trust

998
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:20,429
This,

999
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:22,909
in my opinion, is probably the biggest one, right, from

1000
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,309
a risk perspective.

1001
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,599
The more trust that your employees have in your

1002
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,760
company, the less likely they are to do something

1003
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,699
that they shouldn't do.

1004
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:35,699
It's Gonna help them,

1005
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,039
you know. Number one, be better,

1006
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,398
be more productive.

1007
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:42,188
Like I said, mitigate that risk.

1008
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,909
So building trust is key

1009
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:45,489
to

1010
00:37:45,978 --> 00:37:48,050
and just in general, not even, you know, looking at it from a,

1011
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,188
a perspective of like software monitoring or anything like that, just

1012
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:52,269
in general building that trust with the employees is gonna be

1013
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,320
key. Then lastly,

1014
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,099
I guess this has been my favorite one since I do fraud and

1015
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:59,369
I love fraud is a risk mitigation, right?

1016
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,699
Having real-time data to actually

1017
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:02,719
be able to

1018
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,679
mitigate the risk,

1019
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,619
right? Being able to move from a reactive

1020
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,639
stance to a proactive stance.

1021
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,478
Like that is a game changer.

1022
00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:14,219
Like I said, most of the time, fraud doesn't get

1023
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:15,719
reported until months down the road.

1024
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,090
If it even gets caught at all,

1025
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,530
now we're in a point now where we can say

1026
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,110
we can identify we've learned some of these behaviors, we

1027
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,269
learned some of these patterns now we can build

1028
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,128
out some of these

1029
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,570
alerts and everything that we need to

1030
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,188
to now move into a more proactive stance.

1031
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,309
Now can we stop it, you know, prior to

1032
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:35,829
like minority Report? No,

1033
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:38,389
but we can get close, right? We can actually finally

1034
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,699
catch this and, and be able to stop it

1035
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,389
before any major harm is done.

1036
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:46,898
And on that note,

1037
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:48,570
any questions?
