  "abstract": "A routine productivity audit at Arrivia exposed a sophisticated insider stealing customer data during night shifts, building databases for potential sale. Traditional security measures could detect suspicious access patterns, but couldn't prove intent or methodology. The breakthrough came through Teramind’s behavioral analytics and comprehensive investigation features, which revealed the employee's sophisticated cover-up techniques. See how Teramind’s AI-powered technology transformed Arrivia's security posture and operations based on accurate workforce engagement data. Learn implementation strategies for insider threat detection and building trust through transparent monitoring policies. This presentation is brought to you by Teramind, an AWS Partner.",
