1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,180
- Good afternoon, or good
evening I should say.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,390
Thank you for coming to IND 322,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,710
Redefining operations

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,400
with Caterpillar's Geospatial
Intelligence Solutions.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,680
I'm Steve Blackwell and I
lead our product engineering

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,100
and services team at AWS,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,340
which covers the solution
areas of product engineering

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,930
and smart products and services

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,270
for automotive and manufacturing.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,390
And today it's a pleasure
having started my career

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,880
as an engineer at Caterpillar,
to be co-presenting

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,340
with Ash, Alan and Sriram,

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,810
who are gonna come up on stage later on

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,473
talking about their geospatial
intelligence solution.

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,200
So what do we have for today?

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,520
So I'm gonna start off

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,710
and I just want to give a
brief kind of background

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,140
and overview of how we
talk about smart products

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,060
and services at AWS

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,210
and how we help manufacturers
build their smart products

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,940
and services, you know, solutions on AWS

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,350
for their connected products

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,400
and kind of the capabilities around that.

24
00:00:58,298 --> 00:00:59,610
At that point, I'm then gonna hand over

25
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,250
to the Caterpillar team
who are gonna go through

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,550
a little bit of an overview
of, Caterpillar Inc themselves.

27
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,020
And then go into a
little bit of a deep dive

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,330
around the Cat Helios,

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,130
Caterpillar's digital data platform,

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,180
talk about their construction
customer's problems

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,050
and how they take advantage
of the capabilities

32
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,213
that Cat Digital have been developing.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,780
Then they're gonna go in
to talk about Cat grade.

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,430
And then finally we'll finish off talking

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,127
about VisionLink.

36
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:31,830
Okay, so with that, let's start

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,650
and talk about smart
products and services.

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,173
So when we work with manufacturers,

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,050
smart products and services cover

40
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,150
a broad kind of area

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,550
and we break this down into three pillars.

42
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,580
Consumer, commercial and industrial.

43
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,810
You know, consumer is anything

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,060
from a robot vacuum cleaner in your home

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,590
to a smart plug.

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,250
Commercial, anything from
a printer in an office

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,280
through to a HVAC system
in an office building.

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,780
And then finally industrial,

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,180
everything from a Caterpillar mining truck

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,403
right through to a
robot on the shop floor.

51
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,485
But across these three areas,

52
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,990
we really see a common pattern

53
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,597
of what manufacturers are wanting
to do with their products.

54
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:16,170
The first one is be able
to have it connected.

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,970
And once that connectivity is there,

56
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,240
it then allows the
manufacturer to then start

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,030
providing additional
capabilities on top of that.

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,620
The first one's around kind of,

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,040
when you see this as a journey,
around data and analytics.

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,810
So once that products connected,

61
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,950
they can actually understand

62
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,840
how that product is actually operating

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
and being used out in the field.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,090
From there we see manufacturers then go,

65
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,010
now they understand how
that product's being used,

66
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,590
they've got a little bit
of kind of data analytics

67
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,620
around use cases like
condition-based monitoring.

68
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,260
They can then start applying AI

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,200
and ML on top of that data set

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,180
to start providing insights.

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,210
You know, a prime example around a product

72
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,280
is around predictive
maintenance for example,

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,780
or condition-based monitoring.

74
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,770
But it's not just around the data.

75
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,510
We also say manufacturers looking to see

76
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,390
now that product is actually connected,

77
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,520
it allows them to really focus
on the customer experience

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,690
'cause it allows them to understand

79
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,120
how their customers
are using their product

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
and they can actually start linking,

81
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,750
the telemetry data, the event data,

82
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,800
the usage data of that product
to their customer's insights,

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,290
either through their
service management portal

84
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,490
or through their sales team

85
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,510
or their field service teams

86
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,070
that's actually out with the customer.

87
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,140
So they can actually
start developing features

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,380
and capabilities and start
improving customer's experience

89
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,673
of using their products.

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,380
We're also seeing that
products are evolving as well

91
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,250
and they're now starting

92
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,560
to come a lot more software defined.

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,540
Okay, so it's not just around the hardware

94
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,990
and the IoT or connectivity
platform around that,

95
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,880
but really how they can actually start

96
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,950
to provide more features

97
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,260
and capabilities as software

98
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,300
on those actual products themselves.

99
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,040
So that's really enabling manufacturers

100
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,890
to be able to add new capabilities

101
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,680
to those products once they're
actually out in the field,

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,830
based on customer feedback

103
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,540
or being able to kind of uplift

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,390
and up level that product of
how it's actually being used

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,550
as part of new service packs for example.

106
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,560
And then finally we're
seeing manufacturers see,

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,710
okay, now I've got my product connected,

108
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,680
now I'm offering all these
different kind of capabilities

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,060
around predictive maintenance

110
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,060
or Customer 360, you know,

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,010
can I actually change my business model?

112
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,320
Can I go from, you know, selling a product

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,650
and offering services,
maintenance support packages

114
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,380
to a product as a service

115
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,300
and generating new kind of revenue streams

116
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,923
or creating new business models.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
So that's kind of like the capability,

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
but we very much see
this as kind of a journey

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,150
that manufacturers go through.

120
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,320
You know, a lot of manufacturers

121
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,330
talk about product as a service

122
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,800
but have really gotta start

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,080
at the level one that we describe,

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,990
that connectivity,
understanding those KPIs,

125
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,490
being able to do provisioning,

126
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,290
you know, device management,

127
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,430
device lifecycle, in
some cases in consumer

128
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,500
or commercial, a product may go

129
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,910
through multiple different owners

130
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,710
or be in multiple different sites

131
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,300
or buildings for example.

132
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,340
So therefore that whole
lifecycle management's

133
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,490
gotta be built into it.

134
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,160
We talked about analytics
and AI and services,

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,950
but this is really where
we also see manufacturers

136
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,530
expand beyond their IoT platform

137
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,150
or their connected platform

138
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,430
and start to integrate
it into the aftermarket

139
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,960
parts and servicing.

140
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,513
Okay, so for example, if you know

141
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:40,230
there's a lot of spare parts,

142
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,830
management as part of
their actual product,

143
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,230
how can you use the
product's telemetry data

144
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,700
to feed into the service team's management

145
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,320
of spare parts,

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,990
so unfortunately when
there is a service event,

147
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,720
either proactive or reactive,

148
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,810
and that maintenance
engineer goes out to site,

149
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,390
they actually have the parts
available in their van,

150
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,483
in their truck, to be able
to do the work on that.

151
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,990
And then finally, you know, as I said,

152
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,690
product as a service and
this is really where,

153
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,400
these new business models are coming in.

154
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,070
You know, manufacturers
have been able to offer

155
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,840
SLAs around it

156
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,920
and potentially,

157
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,350
offer capabilities like zero downtime,

158
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,993
outcome-driven engagements.

159
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,780
And as you see as they
go through that journey

160
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,250
of one, two, and three,

161
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,160
we see increased value being added,

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,250
to the customer of using those products.

163
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,520
And this is all really
enabled by what we describe

164
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
as telemetry driven X.

165
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,320
And that X could be, you
know, parts management,

166
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,930
service management as an example,

167
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,420
but really taking the
telemetry from the product

168
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,620
and actually being able to use it

169
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,530
across the extended value chain

170
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,413
of a manufacturer's business.

171
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,010
Okay.

172
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,510
So what does this look like

173
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,880
from a conceptual
architecture point of view,

174
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,650
from a smart products point of view?

175
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,140
Obviously Caterpillar guys
are gonna come up here

176
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,390
and talk specifically
around their architecture

177
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,740
and go into details around

178
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,170
how they've actually architected it.

179
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,690
But this is really our
conceptual architecture

180
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,840
of how we see manufacturers build out

181
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,350
their smart products
and services platform.

182
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,240
So on the left hand
side, obviously we have

183
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,710
the connective product

184
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,220
and that's gonna need
a secure data ingestion

185
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,210
of the data from the
product into the AWS cloud.

186
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,575
In most cases this is done via IoT

187
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:40,800
streaming the telemetry,
the events in some cases,

188
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
depending on where the product is.

189
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,240
If it's like out in a
potential remote location

190
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,380
where connectivity may be not as reliable

191
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,480
as you would have in a city,

192
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,460
there may be bulk uploads of that data

193
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,920
and that may happen
directly via an S3 bucket

194
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,580
or maybe using kind of APIs based on

195
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,980
the products, determining
what its condition is.

196
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,520
Then within the actual AWS cloud,

197
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,210
obviously that data's
gonna come into a data lake

198
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,530
and on top of that data lake,

199
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,340
which is generally built on Amazon S3,

200
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,510
we start to build those
microservices types capabilities.

201
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,390
You know, fleet management
is like one key capability

202
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,360
we see manufacturers build
as part of smart products.

203
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,233
Having remote control and
remote management is a key one.

204
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,530
Obviously telemetry and event management

205
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,930
is generally where most
manufacturers start.

206
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,370
It's kind of their main use case

207
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,770
to actually drive and
build out this platform.

208
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,480
And then on top of that
they've got analytics

209
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,490
and AI insights.

210
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,693
And then finally,

211
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,300
agents kind of come into this,

212
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,060
especially when you start
to talk about maintenance

213
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,930
and so forth,

214
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,920
identifying an event or
anomaly from the product,

215
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,760
you know, you're gonna bring that

216
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,220
into the telemetry management part.

217
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,660
Obviously the analytics

218
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,760
and AI insights is gonna determine,

219
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,720
is that potentially a part
failure or a service event?

220
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,550
And then obviously those
agents are really gonna come in

221
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
to actually orchestrate

222
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,940
creating the service management ticket

223
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,710
for potentially an engineer

224
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,910
or a customer support center

225
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,380
to actually contact the customer

226
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,570
to tell them that actually,
"We'd like to come out

227
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,140
and we'd like to service your
appliance or your vehicle

228
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,840
or your truck or whatever
that product might be."

229
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,190
And then on the right hand side

230
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,780
there's gonna be multiple personas

231
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,680
that are gonna be interacting
with this product platform.

232
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,810
Obviously there's a mobile application,

233
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,010
which the service engineers

234
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,080
or the end users they're gonna be using.

235
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
There's probably gonna be
some business intelligence

236
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,030
capability built on top of it

237
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,866
to be able to understand how
the products are performing,

238
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,787
triple usage of those products

239
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,350
from a features
capabilities point of view.

240
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,190
And there's obviously gonna be

241
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,490
enterprise application
integration, the CRM system,

242
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,593
the MRO system for example.

243
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,590
Okay, so I just wanna touch on one thing.

244
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,830
You know, obviously I talked about agents

245
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,120
as part of that platform,

246
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,707
but really starting to
see manufacturers look at,

247
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:08,280
"Okay, now I've got my
product's connected,

248
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,750
how can I actually bring AI
in to enhance that product

249
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,627
and increase the customer's
experience of that."

250
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,210
And we see a couple of areas

251
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,130
where we're really starting to see AI

252
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,200
really help in products.

253
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,716
First one is around the
product development.

254
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:28,650
Using AI in a machine-based simulation,

255
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,150
helping those physics-based simulations

256
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,470
or designing the product,

257
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,430
either the hardware, you find
an element analysis or CFD

258
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,020
or in the software development,

259
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,030
where helping the developers test,

260
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,703
validate and integrate
their actual software.

261
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,390
Obviously we see assistance
coming into products

262
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,820
and really helping differentiate

263
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,010
and innovate on that actual product

264
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,540
and how it's being used

265
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,860
and starting to provide more of

266
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,860
a personalized experience,
dynamic UI based on

267
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,883
how potentially that person is using

268
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,653
that actual product itself.

269
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,460
And that's a brief overview

270
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,740
of like how we see smart
products and services,

271
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,820
the types of use cases

272
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,920
and how potentially AI is gonna start

273
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,160
to be used more and more in
smart products and services.

274
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,193
And with that I'll hand over to Ash.

275
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,323
- Thanks Steve.

276
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,600
Good evening.

277
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,500
My name is Ash Shah.

278
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,580
I have responsibilities for
sort of technology strategy

279
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,860
and emerging technology,

280
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,020
engineering technology in our space.

281
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,640
Primarily my team is responsible

282
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,920
for determining the
what we need to deliver

283
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,410
to meet customer needs.

284
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,100
So before we get into
the geospatial solution

285
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,970
that you're all here to hear about,

286
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,803
I want to give a little bit

287
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,260
of a background about Caterpillar,

288
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,860
if I can get this slide to work.

289
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,363
Thank you.

290
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,260
So most of you have
probably seen CAT equipment

291
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,940
as you've been driving on the highway

292
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,090
or have gone past job sites.

293
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,410
What you may not realize

294
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,130
is that Caterpillar
has a global footprint.

295
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,010
We are a multinational company,

296
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,840
we are a global leader in the equipment

297
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,380
that is being built that is necessary

298
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,060
for building the infrastructure

299
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,950
that sort of powers our world.

300
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,750
Our workforce, over 112,000 strong,

301
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,410
exists over in 24 different countries

302
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,620
in 140 different locations.

303
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,530
Combine that with our
extensive dealer network

304
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,300
of 152 dealers operating in 190 countries.

305
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,920
That allows us to bring together

306
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,590
a broad range of
expertise in construction,

307
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,910
mining, engines,
turbines, and locomotives.

308
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,250
We also have millions of machines

309
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,030
operating around the world
on almost every continent.

310
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,753
Of those machines,

311
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:03,000
1.5 million of those are connected.

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,430
So from excavators to generators,

313
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,540
they are all streaming
data to our back office

314
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,670
and we then process that.

315
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,460
So how does Caterpillar,

316
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,323
a company with this kind of breadth,

317
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,670
harness that data,
analyzes it, process it?

318
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,020
Well that is sort of the beginning

319
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,960
of our Cat Helios Data Platform journey

320
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,150
and for that I'm gonna
hand it over to Alan

321
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,680
to go into more details on that.

322
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,513
- Thanks Ash.

323
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:31,770
(indistinct) again.

324
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,380
Alright, I'm Alan Doty as
they introduced me earlier.

325
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,379
I'm the director of
architecture for CAT Digital.

326
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,610
Digital's obviously a big buzzword.

327
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,827
What we mean at digital at
Caterpillar is our customer

328
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:45,153
and dealer solutions that enable
them to be very successful.

329
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,700
We're gonna talk about why we built Helios

330
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,040
and we'll talk a little
bit about what we built,

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,830
how we built it and then also
'cause talk about the scale

332
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,720
and then I'll hand it
off back to these guys

333
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,750
to talk about one of the
solutions built on top of it.

334
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,860
Why we built it.

335
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,450
By about in 2018 or so,
we had just a potpourri

336
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,250
of technologies that were deployed

337
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,960
across all our digital solutions.

338
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,040
We had Teradata, we had
Cognos, we had Hadoop,

339
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,020
we had Azure, we had everything,
everywhere all at once.

340
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,050
And we heard back from
our customers of dealers,

341
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,030
they were confused 'cause
all these different solutions

342
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,107
gave a different answer
to what my fleet was,

343
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:27,840
"What's my customer data?"

344
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,817
We didn't really have
very good control of it.

345
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:34,817
And we had another failed
experiment with outside company

346
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,188
that we usually try to go to

347
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:38,790
to solve some of our problems.

348
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,507
So our EO got involved and said,

349
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:41,880
"Okay, we're gonna bring in

350
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,430
somebody that's gonna
help solve this for us

351
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,750
and actually bring in digital talent."

352
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,770
And so I brought in our SVP Ogi Redzick

353
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,810
and he brought in a huge ton of talent

354
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,480
and we set off to build
this Helios platform, right?

355
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,980
We wanted to be confident data,

356
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,350
we wanted all of our
digital solutions to use it,

357
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,760
we wanted to be secure,

358
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,057
we wanted to get all the market
faster on those solutions.

359
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:05,970
And we also want to improve
our customer experience

360
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,673
most overall, so that way
we can make things easier.

361
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,910
So a little bit of how
we built this, right?

362
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,760
So kind of from a logical
architecture perspective

363
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,890
we're looking at on the left hand side

364
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,320
with point A there we
got all the data we need

365
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,530
to bring in from the different sources,

366
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,500
enterprise sources like what
we built, what we manufactured.

367
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,490
Those things are kind of easy.

368
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,290
But once you got to our
dealer and customer,

369
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,020
that became very complex

370
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,960
because we had a 160 different dealers

371
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,540
are their own businesses,
they use their own systems.

372
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,280
So bringing in their service information

373
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,810
of what they actually did to equipment

374
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,210
was very complex and
try to get through that.

375
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,170
And then as Ash said,

376
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,990
we got 1.5 million connected
assets out out there.

377
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,700
So we had to bring all those assets in

378
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,740
and some of those assets devices

379
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,870
are probably made when I was...

380
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,273
When I graduated college
was a long time ago.

381
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,250
So we brought those in

382
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,460
and then what we had to do was
then bring in all that data

383
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,500
and bring a single point of truth, right?

384
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,880
What is an asset, right?

385
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,100
What is a customer, what is a dealer?

386
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,140
And since all those different pieces

387
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,640
of information came
from different sources,

388
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,566
we had to bring those in.

389
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,300
And then we had to bring in services.

390
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,410
So we didn't wanna just
bring in a data platform

391
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,880
and make a data lake.

392
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,590
We actually wanted to build APIs

393
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,240
and services on top of those

394
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
so that way applications can use them

395
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,140
and not replicate the data.

396
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,870
Next we wanted to make sure
that we had data analytics.

397
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,750
We knew the power of the
data wasn't just doing...

398
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,890
Making the data available

399
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,717
but actually putting
insights on top of it.

400
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:34,260
And we built a large data
analytics, pipelines,

401
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,180
execution and training environment

402
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,790
that we can actually
run and build on scale.

403
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,500
That was always our problem before,

404
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,680
all the vendors couldn't
scale our problem size.

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,690
Now we wanna make sure
it's secure to design

406
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,580
and of course we wanna get faster market

407
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,110
and then we want to be able to make sure

408
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,403
we control our costs.

409
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,350
So what did we provide from
a functional perspective?

410
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,450
Like we talked about
from a data perspective,

411
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,460
data was the first thing
we had to get controls of.

412
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,140
We had to get control of

413
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,710
the single truth of customer,
dealer, service, parts,

414
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,543
all those different types.

415
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:07,830
We have over 325 data objects

416
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,990
that we've created and we mastered.

417
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,720
And those services are then
the drive data on top of those.

418
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,780
So we made sure that those drive services

419
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,723
that we could then build
those APIs, events,

420
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,020
notifications, those sort of things.

421
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,700
We built over 340 of those.

422
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,370
So that way I had one single source API

423
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,840
that would give me what my fleet list is

424
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,250
across all my commerce apps,

425
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,190
my customer app, equipment
apps and all those.

426
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,120
Then analytics, we deployed
over 23,000 models,

427
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,990
high frequency inference
models on-demand, real-time

428
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,430
and some obviously you have
your ML ops training as well.

429
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,600
And then onboarding,

430
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,120
we heard it from our customers,
our dealers the most.

431
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,550
Onboarding a customer is very hard.

432
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,850
It's not like the auto industry

433
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,113
where we've got a VIN number

434
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,040
and you have to go to the state

435
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,240
and get your license, right?

436
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,073
We don't know that.

437
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,000
Someone could just say
that I own this tractor.

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,350
So we have to do that a lot more.

439
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,520
It's very hard for us to do.

440
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,950
So we had to do a lot of
investment to get in there,

441
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,653
but we've got 1.7 million
customers on the platform.

442
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,400
So by the numbers we
talk about scale, right?

443
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,250
So obviously we wanna make
sure we're highly available

444
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,010
and that's one of the
reasons why we chose AWS,

445
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,980
over some of the other
cloud providers that we had.

446
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,570
And then we have 296 million
pipelines running per month,

447
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,700
1.4 million API calls

448
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,550
and 50 billion data
records per month as well.

449
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,097
And just an example,
this is all built on AWS

450
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:33,720
for the most part, right?

451
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,030
And just from an example perspective,

452
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,787
680 S3 buckets, 2.1k
(indistinct) there, 5.7 ECS,

453
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,600
Dynamo and Gateway.

454
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,220
Some of course there's
tons of other services

455
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,053
I didn't list on those.

456
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:46,530
Those are just the main scale.

457
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,930
And just to show you that it
wasn't just a single database

458
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,100
that we spun up, right?

459
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,800
It's a very complex environment
that you had to move.

460
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,560
'cause our previous people that tried

461
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,527
to solve this before, they're like,

462
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:00,060
"Oh we'll just spin up
one elastic cache cluster

463
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,970
and one elastic search
will be good to go."

464
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,530
And we're like, "No, that's not gonna work

465
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,630
for the domain size of data that we have."

466
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,070
So we had 15 petabytes of storage,

467
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,940
265 million lines of
code and 3000 pipelines

468
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,670
and one of the happiest things we have

469
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,960
is 125 applications onboarded.

470
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,830
So that's both from a
data BI per perspective,

471
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,900
as well as digital solutions perspective

472
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,150
that are web applications,
things like that.

473
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,830
And that's why I'll
turn it over back to Ash

474
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,540
and Sriram to cover one of the solutions

475
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,980
that they built on top of the platform.

476
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,813
Thanks.

477
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,823
- Thank you.

478
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,700
Alright, so we have
Helios as our foundation.

479
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,450
Now we wanna start thinking about

480
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,500
how do we help our customers solve some

481
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,970
of their toughest challenges.

482
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm not gonna read everything
on the slide for you,

483
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,996
but our customers have
a ton of inefficiencies

484
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,710
both in the construction

485
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,480
and in the mining space.

486
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,000
As you can see from the data on the slide,

487
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,950
there is a ton of opportunity

488
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,103
where we can remove
inefficiencies, remove waste.

489
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,230
We want to use the Helios
platform to get the data,

490
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,990
get the analytics to say how do we

491
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,380
take what we have and
help our customers solve

492
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,183
some of these problems.

493
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,050
So before we get into sort
of the geospatial solution,

494
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,600
let's just talk a little
bit about this, right?

495
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,530
Construction customers are
wasting 10% of their materials,

496
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,857
you know, a third of work is redone

497
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:32,970
and then eventually what that all leads to

498
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,200
is that nearly three quarters
of projects are late.

499
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,900
Any one of you that's
maybe maybe built a house

500
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,720
or gone through that, have
probably felt that pain.

501
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,310
You've seen the inefficiencies

502
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,080
that exist in the construction space.

503
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,110
Now think about that on
a much broader scale.

504
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,330
Some of our big infrastructure
projects, how many

505
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,530
of you have driven down the highway

506
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,140
and you've just seen barrels forever

507
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,750
and you're like, "How long
does it take to update a road?"

508
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,030
And it feels like it's way
longer than it should be, right?

509
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,000
Some of this is a result
of these inefficiencies

510
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,063
where there's just
inefficiencies in the process.

511
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,600
So what we wanted to
do is build a solution

512
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,303
that can try and at least
attack some of these issues.

513
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,960
One of our solutions is Cat Grade.

514
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,670
Cat Grade is Caterpillar's
integrated machine control system

515
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,860
available in a host of different machines,

516
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,310
such as dozers, excavators,
motor graders and pavers.

517
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,526
Think of it like a smart
assistant for heavy equipment.

518
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:32,550
It helps the operator do cut, fill

519
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,770
and sort of pass with precision.

520
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,940
So it's...

521
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,620
you guys who have modern cars

522
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,050
have like lane assist or auto braking.

523
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,960
You know, it helps the operator
use the equipment better.

524
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,350
This is sort of the same
thing with Cat Grade.

525
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,900
Cat Grade uses GPS sensors

526
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,420
and onboard computers
to continuously track

527
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,240
the position of the blade or the bucket.

528
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,110
It provides near real time
location of the digital design

529
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,180
loaded into the system so you know

530
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,720
how you are operating based
on what you need to do.

531
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,050
So you know if you need to slope it by 3%,

532
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,690
the machine can measure the ground terrain

533
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,940
and be able to tell you
whether you're above or below

534
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,553
and then adjust the blade as it needs to.

535
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,993
So in the cab the operator
gets this sort of feedback,

536
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,270
it allows them to make adjustments

537
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,370
and in fact it'll do
some of that for them.

538
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,810
And then every time the machine

539
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,580
goes over a piece of terrain,

540
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,770
that data is collected

541
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,217
and then sent to the back office

542
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,823
where it can be processed.

543
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,360
Now I explain that a lot.

544
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,270
This video will sort of give
you a quick two minute overview

545
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,650
of Cat Grade in action.

546
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,422
Hopefully this will make
it a little bit clearer.

547
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,005
(upbeat music)

548
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,550
- We're here at Carolina
Cat's demo facility

549
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,190
and today we're gonna talk about the D5

550
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,400
with Cat 3D grade and
VisionLink Productivity,

551
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,870
- We're gonna show you the features

552
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,614
of these technology systems

553
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,950
and how they can help
you do your work faster

554
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,210
and more efficiently.

555
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,670
We have a full 3D plan of this site

556
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,920
and we're using the
machine to get the site

557
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,100
to finish grade in the least
amount of time possible.

558
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,750
- Typically we take a USB

559
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,150
and load that 3D design onto the display,

560
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,770
but with VisionLink Productivity

561
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,130
we can actually remotely
load the design in the cloud

562
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,470
and then download it to our machine.

563
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,110
- We can help reduce the
number of trips to the job site

564
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,260
by remotely managing
designs as the plan changes

565
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,110
and ensure the operators on
the latest and greatest plan.

566
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,760
With VisionLink productivity,

567
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,880
we can remotely access
the machine 3D system

568
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,670
to help the operator with
the most efficient settings

569
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,930
onboard the machine

570
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,423
and ensure that it is on
the correct current design.

571
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,006
(upbeat music)

572
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,910
- With Cat 3D grade

573
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,260
and VisionLink Productivity,

574
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,440
the site manager is able
to manage multiple sites

575
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,930
in a much more proficient manner.

576
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,850
Now that Aaron has the file loaded,

577
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,730
he's actually watching the
display in the light bars

578
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,530
that's giving him cuts and fills

579
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,360
and also horizontal alignment,

580
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,670
no matter where he goes on this project.

581
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,730
We added another feature
called 3D steer assist.

582
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,260
Aaron will select the line

583
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,960
and then the machine will
actually move left or right

584
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,810
so that blade tip stays on the focus line

585
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,425
and gives him not only elevation

586
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,743
but steering guidance to that line.

587
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,220
The benefits of CAT 3D grade,

588
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,510
it allows them to use automatics

589
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,650
once they get close to grade

590
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,230
to be more efficient, more productive

591
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,890
With Cat Factory 3D grade
with VisionLink Productivity,

592
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,440
it will allow you to maximize the return

593
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,030
on your machine investment

594
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,710
and get your projects done quicker

595
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,011
in order to make more money.

596
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:44,594
(upbeat music)

597
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,730
- All right, hopefully that made, oops,

598
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,740
hopefully that made a
little bit more sense

599
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,573
about what Cat Grade is.

600
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,310
So a lot of that focus was the in machine,

601
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,230
what we call onboard systems, right?

602
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,438
Helping the operator
actually use the equipment.

603
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,270
As was alluded to, and
you may have seen that

604
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,103
in the video,

605
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,240
there was talking about
VisionLink Productivity,

606
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,460
it's now under the VisionLink umbrella,

607
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,140
but what VisionLink will do is

608
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,780
it's the back office web component

609
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,700
that combines with the onboard data

610
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,490
that we're collecting to
really make this solution

611
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,250
viable for our customers
and allows the back office

612
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,330
to help the operator

613
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,160
and make sure that they're working

614
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,320
on the right information.

615
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,610
One of the problems that we have

616
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,930
that we've seen with customers

617
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,290
is that they work on old designs.

618
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,370
Someone made an update,

619
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,830
that update didn't get
to the correct operator,

620
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,630
he or she is now working

621
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,070
and doing the wrong thing.

622
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,590
This system with Visual
Link in the background

623
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,690
allows us to ensure that all the machines

624
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,570
have the latest designs
and are able to do it.

625
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,910
What Cat Grade gives us is the ability

626
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,730
to correctly measure our
metrics, our volumes,

627
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,490
make sure that the right
amount of dirt has been moved.

628
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,670
We can make sure that our
surfaces are properly constructed,

629
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,820
speeding up the job process,
cutting down on waste

630
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,233
and cutting down on cost.

631
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,100
Having the machines at
the optimal blade settings

632
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,720
and just doing the right amount of work

633
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,610
improves our machine performance

634
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,000
and so that the the
ground is optimized for

635
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and the machine is doing
the best job that it can.

636
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,380
And then because of all of that,

637
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,670
because where is less waste,

638
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,530
there is less damage to the environment.

639
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,000
You know, we have an environmental impact

640
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,250
where the construction work
has the minimal footprint

641
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,623
that it can for sustainability.

642
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,550
Now what we've now getting to the heart

643
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,320
of our geospatial solution is we have

644
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,810
all of this data that's
coming off the machine

645
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,240
that now needs to be
processed by our back office.

646
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,580
The solution that we
built on top of Helios

647
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,470
and that is our geospatial solution.

648
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,400
And I'll hand it over to Sriram,

649
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,780
who is our solution architect,

650
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,430
to provide the technical details.

651
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,020
- Thank you, Ash.

652
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
Caterpillar is a stronger company,

653
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,950
the stronger our digital solutions kit.

654
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,303
This was Ogi, our chief
digital officer in a podcast,

655
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,710
I'm Sriram, solution
architect with Caterpillar

656
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,853
for the last 10 years.

657
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,820
We look at how Caterpillar,

658
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,670
being a huge manufacturing company,

659
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,080
have been building good digital solutions

660
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,463
for our customers to use.

661
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,853
Let me ask you this,

662
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,540
what is the single important factor

663
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,783
that is needed for a business to succeed?

664
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,083
- [Audience Member] Cost efficiency.

665
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,153
- Right?

666
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,320
Anything else?

667
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,737
(indistinct)

668
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,860
Those are right answers, right?

669
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,983
So, but it's not the revenue,

670
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,890
it's not the market share.

671
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:08,700
(indistinct)

672
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,030
Yes, but it's not quality as well.

673
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,140
Not even innovation, right?

674
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,083
But it's the customer satisfaction, right?

675
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:18,975
It that's the most important thing.

676
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,080
At Caterpillar, customer is at the heart

677
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,703
of everything that we build.

678
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,000
So we look at how VisionLink,
that is powered by Helios,

679
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,793
is helping our customers
succeed every day.

680
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,460
Let's do something interesting.

681
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,320
Can I ask all of you to
close your eyes for a moment?

682
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,893
Think of you being in a busy airport,

683
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,933
flights taking off, landing,
moving in every direction.

684
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,080
There is something that
is controlling everything

685
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,023
and keeping everything safe
and coordinated, right?

686
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,630
What is that one thing?

687
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,493
Any guesses?

688
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:14,910
(indistinct)

689
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
I think someone said that...

690
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,003
Yeah, airport control tower, right?

691
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,003
That's the one thing

692
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:24,720
that is actually keeping everything safe

693
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,313
and coordinated in an airport.

694
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,201
Similarly, in a job site,
be it a construction site

695
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,490
or a mining site,

696
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,530
it's VisionLink that is keeping everything

697
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,060
safe and coordinated,

698
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,290
making sure all our machines

699
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,140
are actually working smooth and same.

700
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,210
VisionLink is Caterpillar's
cloud-based solution

701
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,890
that provides real-time visibility

702
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,640
to what is happening in a job site.

703
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,810
You can track fuel levels,

704
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,583
utilization of every machine.

705
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,813
You can schedule maintenance
from the application,

706
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,210
so on and so forth.

707
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,550
You can actually track where my asset is,

708
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,740
what is it actually doing right now.

709
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,970
All those things are
possible with VisionLink.

710
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:15,720
With VisionLink it's all
about making the most

711
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,553
out of the data

712
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:20,553
that you are getting
back to the back office.

713
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,267
We look at...

714
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:29,790
We understood what does VisionLink, right?

715
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,810
So we look at top three use cases

716
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,690
that our customers are
using in conjunction

717
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,183
with the Incap solution
that Ash was talking.

718
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,840
That we have in our digital solution

719
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,390
that are helping our customers.

720
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,750
We are sitting in this
beautiful auditorium, right?

721
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:56,750
The surface that we
are sitting on is flat,

722
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,980
but if you look at a job site, a mining

723
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,450
or a construction site,

724
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,883
you are going to have
elevation changes in them.

725
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,280
So what we are doing
is our Incap solutions

726
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,370
actually pick up the
elevation as the machine

727
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,410
is moving on the job site

728
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,560
and that data is transferred
to the back office

729
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,360
and we can have a elevation profile

730
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,920
that can be shown in the application,

731
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,990
so that customers can understand

732
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,850
what is the elevation profile

733
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,200
of the job site that the
machine is working on.

734
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,430
That's one thing.

735
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,670
And our machines actually move the dirt.

736
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,530
They move the dirt from crest to trough

737
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,250
and then move the dirt from
troughs to crest as well.

738
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,920
We call it as cut and fill

739
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,360
and the back of a solution

740
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,880
can calculate the cut and fill volumes.

741
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,620
These two are critical
parameters in our application

742
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:51,660
where you are able to
understand the lay of the land,

743
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,480
you know how the surface is in a job site

744
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,570
and you are able to
calculate the amount of dirt

745
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,183
that is getting moved
over by our machines.

746
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,913
This is the interesting stuff.

747
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,070
So as you can see, our machines

748
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,610
are sending the data to Helios,

749
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,640
which is actually an upstream
system for our service

750
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,430
that is completely facading everything

751
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,530
that is happening left of us.

752
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,930
So it is just an upstream system,

753
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,550
it's a black box to us

754
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,870
and we are getting the data
from Helios piped into us

755
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,360
and once we get it, we are actually

756
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,130
using a step function.

757
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,340
To parse the data we have
proprietary data formats

758
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,020
that are coming in from the field

759
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,900
and we are parsing the
data using step functions

760
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,640
because we have multiple steps

761
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,490
of parsing that needs to happen.

762
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,584
Once we do that, we store it in Postgres

763
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:58,800
with a PostGIS extension.

764
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,833
We use that for storing our surface data.

765
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,650
Apart from storing the data,

766
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,000
we use SNS-SQS Fanout pattern as well

767
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,270
to do parallel processing
apart from storing the data.

768
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,150
So we use it for calculating the volumes.

769
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,930
We also do elevation tiles
that we are calculating

770
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,270
and then pushing it to an S3.

771
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,820
While we do that and it
is being obviously served

772
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,420
from CloudFront to the end user,

773
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,000
we are actually invalidating the tiles

774
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,520
as we get surface of the data

775
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,610
from the machines, for example, right?

776
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,460
So you have a one foot by one foot data

777
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,990
that is coming into the back office

778
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,370
and while we calculate if
the elevation has changed,

779
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,320
we would need to invalidate the tile

780
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,340
and make sure that we are
showing the right tile

781
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,233
at the right location.

782
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,890
So the bottom portion is
pretty straightforward.

783
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,030
You have the user talking from the...

784
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,950
Through the APA through
ELB and the Fargate task.

785
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,140
Apart from it, from the browser,

786
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,430
he's able to actually download

787
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,920
the tiles from the CloudFront.

788
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,370
Pretty straightforward stuff.

789
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,170
Now that we know the lay of the land,

790
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,530
we knew that the surface
has elevation changes

791
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,830
and you are able to see
the elevation profile.

792
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,920
The to be state surface,

793
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,550
so for example, typically
you'll have a surface

794
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,010
that is having crests and troughs,

795
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,020
and then there will be a surveyor

796
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,490
who will be surveying

797
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,310
and then finding out how
the two to be state surface

798
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,143
needs to be.

799
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,580
Let's say for example you're
constructing an airport,

800
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,880
you'll need a flat surface
at a specific elevation.

801
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,720
That data is actually
created by the surveyor

802
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,000
and then it is created as a design file

803
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,400
and that will be sent to the back office,

804
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,200
from the back office to the machine.

805
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,400
Before that happens through Helios,

806
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,960
again from the application,

807
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,700
so you can upload the design file

808
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,510
and then you'll be able to
send the file to the machine.

809
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,813
Our machines that are actually
working in the job site.

810
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,380
Before we send this into the job site,

811
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,900
we are able to see the
preview of the file.

812
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,240
So what happens is that, let's say this,

813
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,970
as you would've probably guessed,

814
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,360
I can be a site manager working in Vegas

815
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,100
and probably working remotely.

816
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,480
And then there is a operator

817
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,083
who's actually operating the
machine in let's say Peoria.

818
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,990
While he does that, the file
transfer happens remotely.

819
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,750
And what we had seen is that
these files, as I was saying,

820
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,250
the surveyors use design
tools to actually create them

821
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,840
and we do not have a way

822
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,490
for anyone to have those
softwares to visualize them.

823
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,360
What we have brought in is
a visualization capability

824
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,510
where you can look at a
design file in 3D format

825
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,990
before it is actually
sent to the machines.

826
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,410
So this is a really critical
feature for example, right?

827
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,220
So we had

828
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,480
probably 12 months this feature has been

829
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,240
in the production

830
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,760
and prior to that we had
a lot of customer feedback

831
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,630
where operators were actually
getting wrong design files

832
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,790
because the ecosystem is broken

833
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,590
and we had to actually fill in

834
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,510
and then make sure we are sending the...

835
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,730
Allowing the users to
send the right design file

836
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,780
to the machines.

837
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,280
This one does that.

838
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,570
You'll be able to rotate it

839
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:38,370
into 3D and then you'll be able to see,

840
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,010
make sure that you have
the right design file

841
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,260
that is actually being sent across.

842
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,030
So this is on the application

843
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,290
and then this one is actually

844
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,880
on the Incap solution that we have.

845
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,360
So you can make sure that
this is the right design file

846
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,120
and then it is actually
sent to the machine

847
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,670
and as I said, sending to the machine

848
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,070
is happening through Helios.

849
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,260
We use Helios to send it

850
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,890
and there were issues that
we worked with AWS team

851
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,480
to have a work around,

852
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,870
circumventing the problems
that IoT Core has.

853
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,720
So these files are huge files

854
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,930
and IoT Core cannot
support these big files.

855
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,800
So we were working around
doing some circumventing

856
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,360
for handling those situations

857
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,130
and then we were able to make sure

858
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,043
these files are actually
transferred to the machines.

859
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,360
This is again a microservice that we have

860
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,360
for processing the 3D preview feature.

861
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,653
So...

862
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,940
Sorry.

863
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,113
So the user uploads a design file

864
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,840
into S3 bucket using a pre-assigned URL

865
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,010
and then it kicks off a SNS-SQS pattern

866
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,432
into a parallel parsing,

867
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:59,820
where one is we are doing heavy lifting,

868
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,580
processing the design file completely

869
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,820
and then storing the data
into the PostGIS database.

870
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,430
Second one is more of
a lightweight solution

871
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,550
where we are having
the preview generation,

872
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,020
so preview of the file

873
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,780
and the actual processing
are separated out

874
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,670
and one is gonna be heavy lifting.

875
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,640
And then the other one is actually

876
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,340
a lightweight implementation that we have

877
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,410
and it is also served from the CloudFront.

878
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,760
So we generate the file

879
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,140
and it is served from the CloudFront

880
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,950
and then the user is, from the UI,

881
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,720
it is actually pulled onto the CloudFront.

882
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,300
And we do have, as you have seen,

883
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,761
it is having just in time Fargate tasks

884
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:43,053
that are actually getting
created for processing the files.

885
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,550
Now that we saw that what
is the lay of the land

886
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,490
and then I have the to be state design

887
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,550
and the operator has got
it and he has worked on it.

888
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,693
Once he does that,

889
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,740
what is the proof of
completion of the work?

890
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,660
So in certain geographies,

891
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,720
like Europe and Japan,

892
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,080
you do have mandates from
the government agencies

893
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,263
for some submission of
proof of completion of work,

894
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:16,560
so that they are getting paid for.

895
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,560
So our customers who are the contractors

896
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,350
would be actually needing this

897
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:26,250
for generating revenue for their company.

898
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,350
So after they complete the work,

899
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,890
you'll be able to generate
an export of the surface

900
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,530
and it is sent to the agencies.

901
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,465
So we do have multiple plethora of

902
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:42,210
format of files that we can
generate from the surfaces

903
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,400
and we will be able to
actually allow the users

904
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,100
to download them so
that it can be submitted

905
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,323
as a proof of completion of work.

906
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,660
So this is, as I said,

907
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,470
the surface export completion is probably

908
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,700
going to take a lot of time

909
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,400
because we are gonna
have huge amount of data

910
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,380
that we need to parse from the...

911
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,150
Take from the PostGIS database

912
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,740
and then parse it

913
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,540
and then create the format of file

914
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,370
that the user is requesting.

915
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,390
So that being the case,

916
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,940
this is a synchronous process
that we are kicking off.

917
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,520
The user creates an APA request

918
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,060
and then it kicks off
an asynchronous process

919
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,870
and we generate the file
using a Fargate task again

920
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,540
and then it is actually
stored in a S3 bucket

921
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,850
and we use a Lambda to
actually trigger a email.

922
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,610
So because it is an
asynchronous process though,

923
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,330
the user gives an email and
then creates an APA request

924
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,490
and you are creating the file.

925
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,323
Behind the scenes,

926
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:45,090
it could take anywhere
between five to 10 minutes

927
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,550
based on the surface that he's selecting.

928
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,430
So for example, a 10 square miles

929
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,410
of quarry are a mining data

930
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,080
that you wanna process
from a surface standpoint

931
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,670
based on how long the
surface has been stored for,

932
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,590
will be able to actually generate the file

933
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,630
and then store it in S3

934
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,320
and the Lambda would be
sending a presigned URL

935
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,000
as part of the email.

936
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,040
So that's kind of how the users

937
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
get the email from which

938
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,233
they can actually download the file.

939
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,290
I will, and obviously we are looking at...

940
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,140
We are actually using the bounce

941
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,470
and complaint delivery
tracking capabilities of SES.

942
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,820
We were not having those

943
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,820
and we were actually struggling to capture

944
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,440
how many are actually downloading

945
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,460
and those kind of things.

946
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,800
But now that we have
these capabilities in SES,

947
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,953
we were able to actually take
care of those kind of things.

948
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,650
I will add hand over to Steve

949
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,660
for concluding the session.

950
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,493
Thank you.

951
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,153
- Okay.

952
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,020
So hopefully that was some
good insights into how

953
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,150
Caterpillar and the the Cat Digital team

954
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,220
are building capabilities on top of AWS

955
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,183
for their customers around their products.

956
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,210
And I really appreciate them coming here,

957
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,528
sharing their architectures,

958
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:14,730
their best practices

959
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,430
and how they've gone through this.

960
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,913
And this is just one example of a customer

961
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,190
that is doing this on AWS.

962
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,860
Other examples are Unox,

963
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:30,860
who are an Italian manufacturer
of kitchen equipment.

964
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,410
We have Heisenberg, a German manufacturer

965
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,930
that do printing presses.

966
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,130
HP, with their industrial print
presses also have done this.

967
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,320
So we have multiple
examples of how customers

968
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,910
are about building their
connected product platforms on AWS

969
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,430
and not just providing insights

970
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,460
in how those products
have being used for that,

971
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,400
but actually building
services on top of that,

972
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,500
as you saw with Helios and VisionLink

973
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,050
of how they can actually
provide better experiences

974
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,023
and better usage of those
products to those customers.

975
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,700
Okay, with that I wanna say thank you.

976
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,863
I really do appreciate
you staying with us.
