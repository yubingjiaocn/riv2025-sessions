1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,640
- Good day, good people.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,530
Wow, it's amazing to be here.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,050
It's such a great venue
with you all in person.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,970
Thanks for joining us.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,970
Quick show of hands, how many
of you are building AI agents?

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,150
Almost everyone, right?

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,983
Sure.

8
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,873
How many of you have deployed
agents in production?

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,320
Wow, okay, perfect.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,400
Most of you guys.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,963
All right, how many of you
are developing MCP tools?

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,020
Lot of them, great.

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,380
And then how many of you
have more than 10 MCP tools?

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,223
More than 10.

15
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:38,130
Few, 25%, Okay.

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,040
More than 50 MCP tools,

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,330
just two folks.

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,100
All right, excellent.

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,210
Thank you.

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,090
So you are gonna be
learning in this session

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,050
how to scale from those first few tools

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,050
to thousands of tools
across hundreds of agents

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,890
securely at enterprise grade
without operational headache.

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,568
My name is Dhawal Patel,
I'm the global lead

25
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:09,330
for solutions architecture
team in generative ai.

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,360
And let's dive in into this topic.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,193
So

28
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,733
across industry verticals,

29
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,920
across multiple companies
and industry verticals

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,780
like healthcare,

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,490
finance,

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,500
security operations,

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,680
observability and many more,

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,523
companies are transforming their customer

35
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:35,040
experience using agentic ai.

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,070
And we are really honored to
have one of our customers,

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,160
Sumo Logic, who's gonna share our journey,

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
their journey in agentic AI in security

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,660
operations space in this session.

40
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,450
So I'm really looking forward
to their story as well.

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,430
But here's the thing,

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,170
your AI agents needs real data.

43
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,120
Your data, the data could be
sitting in knowledge basis,

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,600
private data stores, enterprise APIs,

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,480
or even the data could be sitting on prem.

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,030
The magic happens right there,

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,360
agent to tool, data integration layer.

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,880
This is really critical for you to scale.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,430
In order to scale and be able to succeed

50
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,310
in your agentic AI
success, in your journey.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,143
So let's dive in.

52
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,260
Why?

53
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,640
So

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,420
let's imagine that you are developing

55
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,920
a customer support agent for retail,

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,440
and the users are basically able

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
to shop, they're able to get the support,

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,440
check the order status, and
then you develop this great POC

59
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:45,900
and works great with few
of your user queries.

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,830
You are excited about it, your
stakeholders are impressed

61
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,760
and now they ask you to deploy
it in production at scale.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,451
That's when the reality hits.

63
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:59,649
Now you think about scaling
from those first few users

64
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:02,520
to thousands of users.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,370
You need to also manage
the infrastructure scaling.

66
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,250
But hey, before that you
need to make sure that

67
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,280
your AI agents can talk to real data,

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,113
your data,

69
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,850
and can integrate with
your enterprise APIs.

70
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,670
So that you can accurately
respond, your agents,

71
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,000
to respond to the user
queries with right accuracy

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,470
and without hallucinations.

73
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,490
How do you do that?

74
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,323
So

75
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:27,210
what you do then
essentially is well you say

76
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,210
let me integrate with some of
my existing enterprise APIs

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,190
that could help my customer support agent

78
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,356
like product catalog and then pricing

79
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:41,040
and then customer details.

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,031
And then you slowly and steadily,

81
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,240
you try to integrate these tools

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,290
with your AI agent and
then why just only APIs?

83
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,460
Then you think about like,

84
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,720
let me also integrate my MCP
tools or MCP servers as well,

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,940
or maybe talk to other AI agents as well,

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,070
as agents, as tool pattern.

87
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,510
So now you try to decouple
the agents and tools to scale.

88
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,680
And so now you have
this great architecture

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,490
where you have a clear distinction
between agents and tools.

90
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,080
Now

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,010
you might have

92
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,970
20,

93
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,990
30,

94
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,823
50

95
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,870
tools to manage.

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,730
Still manageable, right?

97
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,620
Well let's see how.

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,100
So now you have your other
team members onboarding,

99
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,120
developing different other
agents like pricing agent,

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,960
shopping agent or essentially
maybe that you try

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,350
to decompose that large
customer support agent

102
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,710
into manageable specialized agents.

103
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,270
Or maybe you have different use case

104
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,520
or maybe you're developing
new product features

105
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
and now you have these
N-number of agents to manage

106
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,470
with M-number of tools to manage

107
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,100
with that M cross N

108
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,740
exponential growing complexity to manage.

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,920
And that's exactly why
you need to scale this.

110
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,920
And you have the protocols
like model context protocol,

111
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,760
which you are all aware of
and which really takes care

112
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,670
of inter-operability

113
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,870
and making sure that

114
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,000
you have this unified communication

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,281
between the agents and the tools.

116
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:24,570
However, this is clearly not enough

117
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,202
because you still have
this sprawling architecture

118
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,310
where you still have these agents

119
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,800
talking to these number of tools

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
and you need to handle the governance,

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,080
you need to handle the
fine-grain access control,

122
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,300
you need to handle the security

123
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,860
and you need that single
communication unified point.

124
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,750
Where you can govern all these things

125
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,360
and scale at enterprise level, right?

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,360
And then think about it, when
your customer base grows,

127
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,490
you're gonna have a lot
of users, maybe thousands,

128
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,770
maybe hundreds of thousands of users.

129
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,900
And then you are gonna have
these different personas

130
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,190
of these users accessing these agents

131
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,790
and then bring this
multi-tenancy into the play

132
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,730
where you're developing
these agents as service.

133
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,040
And now you have to
manage these tenants like

134
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,690
hundreds of tenants.

135
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,420
So you have these different
permutation combinations

136
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,150
of fine-grain access control
of who gets to access

137
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,490
which tools, is really a lot

138
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,950
of heavy lifting for you to manage.

139
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,530
In this diagram, what I'm
showing is a pricing agent is

140
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,590
same, but being accessed
by two different users.

141
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,120
You want one of those users

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
or some of those users to have access

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,710
to promotional discounts while
you don't want other users

144
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,740
to have access to those
promotional discounts.

145
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,850
How do you do that?

146
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,100
How do you do that
dynamically as well, right?

147
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,810
You need to scale that as well.

148
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,379
So here's the thing,

149
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,860
you start with business use case.

150
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,470
You start with the user queries,

151
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,320
you define your agent goals,

152
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,150
you decompose your agent goals
into manageable agentic tasks

153
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,780
and then walk backwards
and identify existing

154
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,250
enterprise APIs or data that you can use

155
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,420
to satisfy the agentic tasks.

156
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,720
And then as you continue
working backwards,

157
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,540
you identify those data custodians

158
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,410
and the existing microservices
that can satisfy those task

159
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,450
and then map it out, work backwards,

160
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,250
in identifying the right MCP
targeted tools for our agents.

161
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,390
And then what you end up
with is lots of MCP servers,

162
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,030
maybe hundreds of MCP servers now.

163
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,590
And then you have these on the other end,

164
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,486
like lots of agents,
maybe hundreds of agents

165
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:50,035
accessing this thousands of MCP servers.

166
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,590
It's clearly a lot of
heavy lifting, again.

167
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,020
You're gonna have to
manage the infrastructures,

168
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,380
scaling, containerization
of these MCP servers.

169
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,860
A lot of heavy lift for you, right?

170
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,240
What do we do, what's the answer?

171
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,650
Well before we go into the
solution, here's the thing.

172
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,320
You need to scale maybe
at hundreds of agents

173
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,860
with thousands of tools,
with hundreds of MCP servers

174
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,910
to manage, with these different
types of API types to manage

175
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,830
and MCPify them.

176
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,180
And then these...

177
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,430
Add this multi-tenancy into the mix.

178
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,740
Probably you're gonna end up
having hundreds of thousands

179
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,970
of tenants,

180
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,400
with hundreds of thousands
of permutation combinations

181
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,282
of tools policies to manage, dynamically.

182
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,486
How do we scale?

183
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:35,260
What you really need is

184
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,710
a single,

185
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,270
unified,

186
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,340
communication point

187
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,430
for all of your
agent-to-tool interactions.

188
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,420
And when I say tool, I just
don't mean only the APIs

189
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,830
or data stores,

190
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,440
I also mean other agents as well.

191
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,473
Acting as the tool as
well, for the other agents.

192
00:08:56,473 --> 00:09:01,473
And what you really need to
have is a very fast, quick way

193
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,313
of MCPfying your existing APIs.

194
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,320
You need to have purpose
build features like tools,

195
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,100
semantic tools discovery,
fine grain access control,

196
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,290
integration with authorization,

197
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,550
maybe also integrating with
your existing IDP solutions

198
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,290
for authorization,

199
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,330
integration with observability,

200
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,060
and don't forget the evaluations.

201
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,220
This is what you need in order to scale.

202
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,770
And that's exactly how we built

203
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,413
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore gateway.

204
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,700
So Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway

205
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,930
offers the single unified
communication point.

206
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,820
It's a purpose built AI
gateway for all of your

207
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,130
agent-to-tool interactions
with one click MCPification

208
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,650
of your existing enterprise APIs.

209
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,980
You can also MCPify your
AWS Lambda functions.

210
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,040
You can also integrate
your existing MCP servers

211
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,400
and unify that in that unified endpoint.

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,140
It does all of that heavy lifting
of MCP protocols handshake

213
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,020
for you so that you're not
in the business of managing,

214
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,220
upgrading your containers

215
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,500
and servers to new protocol versions.

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,530
And then think about the
fine grain access control.

217
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,010
Think about all the problems
that I shared before, right?

218
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,850
You need to scale as an
M-cross-N complexity increases.

219
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,480
It's completely serverless, pay as you go.

220
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,480
And you can also connect
from your private VPC

221
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,360
and have a secure communication
with your MCP gateway

222
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,983
with your AgentCore gateway.

223
00:10:39,163 --> 00:10:42,480
Alright, so I'm gonna hand it over to Nick

224
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,170
to further dive deep into
AgentCore Gateway features.

225
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,003
Thank you.

226
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,780
- Hello, can everyone hear me okay?

227
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,703
Okay, fantastic.

228
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,640
So my name is Nick Aldridge,

229
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,290
I'm one of the principal engineers

230
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,660
in the agentic AI org at AWS.

231
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,270
I've been at Amazon for about seven years,

232
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,640
worked on a bunch of AI
products like Amazon Lex,

233
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,630
Amazon Bedrock.

234
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,000
I've led the team that
built knowledge bases

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,686
and now I helped create AgentCore.

236
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,870
I also happen to be one of
the core maintainers of MCP

237
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,233
and I serve on the steering
committee of A-to-A.

238
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:21,690
So what I want to do is
dive a little bit deeper

239
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,270
into some of the things
that Dhawal mentioned

240
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,935
and talk a bit about how this
works from a technical lens.

241
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:29,760
So what you see on the screen

242
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,410
is a high level architecture
diagram of the gateway, right?

243
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,420
And you can see that gateway is acting

244
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,420
as this intermediary like
Dhawal mentioned, right?

245
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,620
Where on the left hand
side you see your agent,

246
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,210
which is in theory interacting
with other agents and tools

247
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,890
and resources, right?

248
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,812
And the gateway is really acting

249
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,420
as an intermediary like I said.

250
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,070
And also as a translator,

251
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,540
it's providing a standard
interface for all of those tools,

252
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,020
APIs and agents to talk to.

253
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,980
And the cool thing is those
tools, APIs and agents

254
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,780
can live on any cloud, right?

255
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,688
They might be on GCP,
they might be on AWS,

256
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:14,880
they could be running on EKS

257
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,860
or they could be running on EC2.

258
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,560
Gateway is fronting all of those things.

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,710
So on the left hand
side you can see Gateway

260
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,491
is providing a few operations,

261
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:27,450
list tools, search tools, invotool.

262
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,760
These are standard MCP operations.

263
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,410
It's also providing a standard

264
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,240
authorization interface, right?

265
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,260
So you can decide whether
you want to use OAuth or IAM,

266
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,850
but Gateway will perform that
standard authorization check,

267
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,510
it will talk to your identity
provider if necessary

268
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,010
and then it will perform routing.

269
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,286
So it will figure out, hey,
is the API I need to talk to

270
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,680
running on this server or that server,

271
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,290
and it will make the appropriate call

272
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,060
with the appropriate credential.

273
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,759
So it will also perform
a credential exchange

274
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,650
and all of those calls

275
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,740
will have standard logging and auditing.

276
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,420
So as a business

277
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,280
who wants to solve some specific
business problems, right?

278
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,260
I can use Gateway to not worry
about the integration points.

279
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,810
I can use Gateway just
to give my developers

280
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,690
who are building agents
that standard interface

281
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,120
so that they can just
focus on the agent building

282
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,273
and Gateway can manage
the integration points.

283
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,095
Now there are different ways

284
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:34,140
that you can provide these tools, APIs

285
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,511
and agents to the Gateway.

286
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,250
One way you can provide them

287
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,350
is by hooking up a Lambda function.

288
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,690
So you can hook up any
arbitrary Lambda function

289
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,840
and Gateway will be able to
expose that Lambda function

290
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,650
as an MCP tool, or group of MCP tools,

291
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,070
and Gateway will be able to
do the translation necessary

292
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,890
to authorize to that Lambda function

293
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,471
by assuming this IAM role.

294
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,470
All the while you're
getting, sort of, that log

295
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,320
and auditability that I talked about.

296
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,310
Something similar works for APIs.

297
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,370
Now when I talk to customers
about open API specs,

298
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,580
they often think about these
as existing APIs that are sort

299
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,770
of production grade, right?

300
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,150
This is not necessarily a spec
for a production grade API.

301
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,950
This could be a spec that
defines the input to your server

302
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,530
that's running on EKS
with Kubernetes, right?

303
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,060
It could be an API spec for
something that's running on GCP.

304
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,450
It could even be a spec
for another company's API,

305
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,220
which you don't own.

306
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,788
And all of those API specs can
be hooked up to the gateway.

307
00:14:42,788 --> 00:14:47,788
You can choose from different
credential types like API key,

308
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,290
OAuth token,

309
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,720
and then Gateway will
again provide that sort of

310
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,833
standard interface to
those APIs for your agent.

311
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,735
The third way you can provide APIs

312
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,550
and tools is a Smithy model.

313
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,500
Smithy specification.

314
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,450
This may not be a
familiar term to you all,

315
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,890
but this is how we define APIs at AWS.

316
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,340
We use this specification called Smithy.

317
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,728
And so the amazing thing
about this integration is

318
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:19,860
there are 400 plus AWS services

319
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,400
that offer these Smithy
specifications on GitHub.

320
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,464
So you can actually take
those specifications,

321
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:27,718
plug them into Gateway

322
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,990
and get an interface to any of the APIs

323
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,610
that those services use.

324
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,550
So suddenly your agents can
do things like download files

325
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,910
from S3 buckets, they can
execute jobs on transcribe

326
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,530
and do all sorts of other things.

327
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,870
So this is an incredibly
powerful integration

328
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,150
and one that a lot of teams in AWS

329
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,593
are also very excited about.

330
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,910
Now we had those integrations

331
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,040
and we were excited
about those integrations

332
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,270
and customers told us,

333
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,260
Hey, that's all well and good
but I have some MCP servers

334
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,760
in my organization today,
plus I have MCP servers

335
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,030
outside my organization
that I want to connect with.

336
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,830
And ideally I want your fancy
gateway thing to compose all

337
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,990
of them in a single interface.

338
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,240
And so in response to that problem,

339
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,600
we launched MCP server as a target.

340
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,180
And what MCP server as a target does

341
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,480
is it lets you attach any MCP server,

342
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,450
as many as you want to a gateway.

343
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,510
And we will fill all of their tools

344
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,620
in the list of tools alongside
the API spec ones, et cetera.

345
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,120
When a customer invokes a tool,

346
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,150
we'll invoke the corresponding
tool on the MCP server

347
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,250
and we even support
search over those tools

348
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,293
and we'll talk about how that works.

349
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,830
Now, when you are
listing tools, we do this

350
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,830
by caching the tool
schema of all of the tools

351
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,600
that your APIs and MCP servers expose.

352
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
So Gateway first caches
all of those tools.

353
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,830
Your agent can ask,

354
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,660
Hey, give me the list and will respond

355
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,336
to the list even without making
additional downstream calls.

356
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:11,190
The agent can then decide
it wants to invoke a tool

357
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,000
and Gateway will
facilitate that invocation

358
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,153
while also doing the
appropriate credential exchange.

359
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,700
And as I mentioned,
gateway will offer search.

360
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,000
So it will rely on this
cached copy of tools

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,630
to create an internal index
which it's actually able

362
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,630
to search in real time in
response to an agent query.

363
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,720
And what this unlocks is that,
rather than giving an agent

364
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,610
a list of a few hundred tools,

365
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,830
let's say, you can actually give it

366
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,953
just the appropriate list of
the 10 most relevant tools.

367
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,410
Now there are two ways
that Gateway actually

368
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,830
does this synchronization of your toolset

369
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,542
and the entire fact that we
cache tool sets is something

370
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,370
that is based on feedback
from customers as well.

371
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,210
Customers told us,

372
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,710
Hey, I don't want the tools

373
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,410
to be dynamically changing under the hood.

374
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,270
I want those tools to be static.

375
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,280
I want to control which tools are exposed,

376
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,890
when they're exposed, what
the interfaces are, right?

377
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,920
I want to evaluate those
interfaces on my agent

378
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,170
and make sure I'm getting
the appropriate accuracy.

379
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,640
So we cache those tools.

380
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,280
One way we do that is
implicit synchronization.

381
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,963
So whenever you change a target,

382
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,523
whenever you update a target,
we cache the tool set.

383
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,360
The other way that we let you do this

384
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,730
is something called
explicit synchronization,

385
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,230
where you can explicitly invoke this API

386
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,900
and we will look at all
of the tools available

387
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,720
on your MCP server and cache them

388
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,570
so that they can be used in
search and listing et cetera.

389
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,360
Now to dive a little
deeper on search, right?

390
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,930
As I mentioned, a lot of
customers are building MCP servers

391
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,763
with a lot of tools.

392
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,660
At the beginning a bunch
of you raised your hand

393
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,690
that you had, you know, dozens
of tools in your MCP servers

394
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,580
and that will likely increase, right?

395
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,740
As you continue to scale
up your applications,

396
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,660
you'll have more and more tools.

397
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,780
And what we found from
customers is when they had more

398
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,950
and more tools, it was
bloating their context window.

399
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,330
So they had these agents which
suddenly had like 300 tools

400
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,880
and we're spending hundreds
of thousands of tokens

401
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,790
of context on just loading up the tools,

402
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,030
which was not only high
latency and very expensive

403
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,890
but also impacting accuracy, right?

404
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,380
The agents were not able
to orchestrate effectively

405
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,845
over so many tools.

406
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:39,480
And so we introduced
this thing called search

407
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,240
and I think we may have
even been first to market

408
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,890
with this feature where we
allow you to call a search tool,

409
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,430
and get back the 10 most relevant tools.

410
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,450
Obviously this drastically
reduces latency and cost

411
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,610
and improves accuracy.

412
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,760
It also is pretty
remarkable that we are able

413
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,340
to do this across so many targets, right?

414
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,830
We are managing all that heavy lifting

415
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,810
of pulling in all the tools from all

416
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,650
of the different targets

417
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,840
so that you can search them together.

418
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,750
Otherwise, if you hook up
many servers to your agent,

419
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,910
it will have to sort of
do search across them,

420
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,713
which is complicated.

421
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,430
The other thing that
customers told us is, hey,

422
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,040
if I'm gonna have a unified
layer that's gonna integrate

423
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,480
with all my agents and tools

424
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,590
and resources, then I am
absolutely going to need this

425
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,481
to connect to my VPC.

426
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:34,680
And so we quickly launched
private link integration

427
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,140
so that you can actually communicate

428
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,950
with this gateway over the
secure AWS network backbone

429
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,540
so that traffic is never going out

430
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,243
to the public internet to
go talk to this gateway.

431
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,860
As important as secure
inbound connectivity is,

432
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,220
secure outbound connectivity
is just as important, right?

433
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,340
I want to be able to
access APIs that may live

434
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,290
inside of EPC.

435
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,140
And so with our Lambda integration,

436
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,310
you can actually call any API in any VPC

437
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,230
and have that call, again,

438
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,080
go over the secure AWS network backbone

439
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,630
so you can have this entire
life cycle of requests

440
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,030
that never actually go
over the public internet.

441
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,663
Now

442
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,250
the reason I think Gateway is

443
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,900
so amazing is I really think
that the protocols are going

444
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,720
to become like TCP/UDP.

445
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,210
In other words, our
developers are not going

446
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,270
to be diving deep into protocols like MCP

447
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,536
in the future, right?

448
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:39,946
And I think that

449
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:41,910
I will want my stack

450
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,064
to be continuously cross-cloud,
cross-framework, et cetera.

451
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:49,680
And I will want a infrastructure product,

452
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,080
a basic product that can solve

453
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,000
all of that integration stuff.

454
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,410
And so in this picture you can see

455
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,180
just how powerful gateway is.

456
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,435
We've hooked up AWS services, right?

457
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:04,350
A private MCP server
which is running in A VPC,

458
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,470
A private agent, which
is running in A VPC,

459
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,690
another AgentCore gateway

460
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,780
that another team in our
organization has built.

461
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,640
Public MCP servers, which we
may have discovered online.

462
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,790
and then APIs, some of
which may be running

463
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,300
on AgentCore runtime or maybe
running on EC2, et cetera.

464
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,830
And we're able to expose all of that

465
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,513
in this single interface.

466
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,350
Diving a little bit deeper, right?

467
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,960
On how we do this authorization thing

468
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
because this is part of the magic.

469
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,640
We offer two types of
ingress authorization,

470
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,570
like I mentioned.

471
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,840
One is Oauth, and the awesome thing

472
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,480
about the OAuth integration is
it uses your proprietary IDP,

473
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,510
your proprietary identity
provider to do authorization.

474
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,180
So when a caller tries
to access a gateway,

475
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,230
gateway will say,

476
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,380
Hey, you need to go talk
to authorization server X,

477
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,910
which you all own.

478
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,100
And then the client can go talk

479
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,690
to that authorization server,

480
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,490
get an access token,

481
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,560
and then make calls through the gateway,

482
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,360
which the gateway will authorize

483
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,290
against your identity provider.

484
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,360
So you sort of have this complete loop,

485
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,510
which can be using your
proprietary identity provider,

486
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,563
instead of IAM.

487
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,520
The other approach for those of you

488
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,210
that are deep in the IAM
ecosystem is to use IAM.

489
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,810
So gateway supports IAM
and you can call with IAM.

490
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,400
And we really did this in response

491
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,330
to customers who were saying,

492
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,740
Hey, like I love IAM today.

493
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,820
I use, IAM for a bunch

494
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,931
of my machine to machine communication.

495
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,450
And so we said that's fine,

496
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,445
we know MCP doesn't support IAM today.

497
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:44,070
We added IAM support to the gateway

498
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,860
and we actually launched a secure proxy

499
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,900
that you can run on the client side

500
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,670
to make your MCP client,
IAM or Sigv4 compatible.

501
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,397
And you can discover
that on GitHub as well.

502
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:59,214
The other thing that customers
started telling us was,

503
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:02,390
Hey, I want to expose gateway

504
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,080
in front of my real end users,

505
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,570
and those end users may not be off.

506
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,880
I might want to make this thing public.

507
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,920
And so we actually ended up launching

508
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,070
a mode of gateway that does not have off.

509
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,440
In fact many of you may have seen

510
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,070
that AWS launched an MCP
server for our documentation.

511
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,470
It uses no off gateways

512
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,783
to make that public
documentation available.

513
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,960
We'll also see later how
you can integrate this

514
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
with a custom lambda authorizer

515
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,083
to run your custom off only.

516
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,620
on the egress side, right?

517
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,740
I mentioned that we do
secure credential exchange.

518
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,280
So on the egress side, what
gateway's essentially doing

519
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,280
is picking the correct
token to call the downstream

520
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,460
by calling our AgentCore identity service.

521
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,493
And that service is responsible for

522
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,140
securely storing your credentials,

523
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,960
whether those are API keys,
OAuth tokens, et cetera.

524
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,720
And also caching the actual access tokens.

525
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,510
So that when you make
those downstream calls,

526
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,010
you don't have the off-fatigue

527
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,277
of continuously offing your users again

528
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:13,833
and again for accessing
the same downstream API.

529
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,740
Now that was all sort of well and good,

530
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,310
but when we talked to most
of our customers, they said,

531
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,540
Hey, we have fine grain access
control logic we wanna run.

532
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,850
we have multi-tenant scenarios

533
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,460
that require us to
implement some custom logic.

534
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,320
We want to prefill some parameters

535
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,780
and not prefill other parameters, right?

536
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,660
And so in response to
this overwhelming demand,

537
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,350
we launched, last week,
something called interceptors.

538
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,760
And interceptors are groundbreaking
because they allow you

539
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,780
or your central teams to
run some standard logic

540
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,100
in between the agent invocation
and the tool invocation.

541
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,230
So that allows you to do things like

542
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,790
fine grain access control.

543
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,630
It allows you to do things
like filtering of parameters

544
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,640
or schema translation or things like this.

545
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,740
So it's an incredibly powerful feature

546
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,860
and it's powered by Lambda, today.

547
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,350
So this is kind of the
architecture diagram

548
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,090
of how this looks.

549
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,414
Essentially a request comes in

550
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:22,110
and we first pass it through this lambda,

551
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,700
which gets the MCP request

552
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,130
and outputs another MCP request,

553
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,200
which can be totally mutated

554
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,670
or the Lambda can even say,

555
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,190
Hey, this caller is not
authorized to access this tool,

556
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,720
sorry.

557
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,340
If the request is authorized,

558
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,580
we'll actually invoke the target, process,

559
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,465
get back the result and send the result

560
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,150
through the lambda as well.

561
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,980
And you can choose
whether to do this or not.

562
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,410
But then on the results side,
you can also do filtering

563
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,810
or inject additional
parameters or things like that.

564
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,300
So it's an incredibly powerful feature

565
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,130
and this is what it would look like

566
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,860
if you just did it for
fine grain access control,

567
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,693
right?

568
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:59,430
So in this case, I'm
gonna run that lambda,

569
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,920
I will look at the
caller OAuth information,

570
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,940
which we provide.

571
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,770
I'll look at the tool name and I'll say,

572
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,620
okay, this caller is in finance group

573
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,690
and they're trying to
access a non-finance tool.

574
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,860
Denied, right?

575
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,110
Or this caller is allowed
to access this tool.

576
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,860
Okay fine, and I'll let it through.

577
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,851
They can also kind of do this

578
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:22,980
in conjunction with list tools.

579
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,810
So when they use this feature

580
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,860
in conjunction with list tools,

581
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,020
they can decide independently

582
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,840
whether they want to run the
Lambda on list tools or not.

583
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,970
In this case, what we're
showing is they're not

584
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,140
running the Lambda on list tools.

585
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,660
So the list of tools is sort of public

586
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,530
and the lambda is running
only on invocation.

587
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,360
Essentially only preventing you

588
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,790
from incorrectly invoking a tool

589
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,340
which you don't have access to.

590
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,200
But alternatively you could

591
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,930
run this lambda on list tools as well.

592
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,530
So you could actually
filter out tools proactively

593
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,410
that the caller will not have access to

594
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,620
or you could proactively remove
parameters which you don't

595
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,600
want the agent to fill.

596
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,170
So it gives you just a totally
newfound control over the

597
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,420
interface you are providing to the agent.

598
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,490
And you can make it totally custom.

599
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,230
This also works for search,

600
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,090
so you can also filter that search list,

601
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,070
so that it's only the tools

602
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,620
which the caller has access to.

603
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,790
And many customers are
interested in using this

604
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,670
for things like token propagation,

605
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,880
they wanna actually inject
their own downstream token

606
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,910
and take over some of that
secure credential exchange.

607
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,470
You can do that too, right?

608
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,780
Your Lambda can add this thing in pink,

609
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,931
this authorization
header with a new token,

610
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:43,530
so that they can do
federated calls downstream.

611
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,380
So this is, I think, really a game changer

612
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,330
and really helping
customers to actually take

613
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,373
this thing live in production.

614
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,280
And the last thing I wanna quickly mention

615
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,070
is we are continuously
hearing from customers

616
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,480
that setting up your tool set to expose it

617
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,030
to an agent is actually
pretty hard, right?

618
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,550
Nobody wants to expose their APIs as is.

619
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,830
Everybody wants to write
some code on top of them

620
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,230
and then you have to, you
know, edit your descriptions

621
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,270
and figure out the right
format and all the stuff.

622
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,270
So we actually built a custom
agent which helps you do that.

623
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,790
This custom agent, which you
can find on GitHub, walks you

624
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,230
through the process of getting
a schema which is useful

625
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,740
to an agent, which is valid, right?

626
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,410
From whatever internal
schema you may be using

627
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,750
and which can actually
be integrated in Gateway.

628
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,323
So this really, really simplifies
the onboarding process.

629
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,960
And so I know that was
a lot of information

630
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,290
and with that I want
to turn it over to Kui

631
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,140
to talk a little bit about how Sumo Logic

632
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,820
has deployed this in production,

633
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,820
how they're solving some
of these problems for real.

634
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,653
Thanks.

635
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,830
- Thank you Nick.

636
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,690
Great presentation to
kick off the use case

637
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,390
of AgentCore Gateway as well as dive into

638
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,900
the nuts and bolts of how
AgentCore Gateway works.

639
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,560
We like AgentCore and for
the next 15 minutes or so,

640
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,260
I'm gonna take you guys
through our journey

641
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,427
to agentic AI using
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

642
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,340
So how many, can I take
a quick show hands,

643
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,773
how many people heard or
used Sumo Logic before?

644
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,541
Okay, how many of you have
solved the reliability

645
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:36,541
and observability issues
with your workload,

646
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,337
show of hands?

647
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,960
And how many of you have worked

648
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,201
with the security investigation?

649
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:46,353
Things like a triage or
investigation for vulnerabilities?

650
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,840
Okay, cool, that's a good...

651
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,460
Good ratios here.

652
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,650
I like all the agentic AI builders,

653
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,820
this is our experience.

654
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,713
Like to share how we did that.

655
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,113
And actually before I show the demos,

656
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:05,160
I want to give a little
highlight about Sumo Logic.

657
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,160
We are leading cloud scale
intelligent operation platforms,

658
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,520
and we are born in AWS
cloud, 10 years ago,

659
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,260
and right now we're running
on 10 AWS regions worldwide.

660
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,960
And just give you a sense of our scales.

661
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,649
We ingest, net new telemetry data,

662
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,110
multi-petabytes of data
ingestion every day,

663
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,470
and multi-exabyte of data scan every day.

664
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,890
That gave you a sense of the
scale Sumo logic can handle.

665
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,880
We have a hundred...

666
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,773
We have a thousands of
enterprise grade customers

667
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:43,650
and the demo I'm gonna show
you is how our agent works.

668
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,930
I'm gonna show you two
part of the experience.

669
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,070
The first part is there are
several autonomous investigation

670
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,170
agents working simultaneously

671
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,235
and secondly I want to show you

672
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:58,950
beyond autobox, beyond going
to Sumo Logic consoles,

673
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,320
how to leverage your everyday apps,

674
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,760
how the agent works seamlessly
with your day-to-day apps.

675
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,950
And thanks for AgentCore Gateway.

676
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,713
Alright, let's, let's show the demos.

677
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,750
Can everyone hear the voice?

678
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,583
Good?

679
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,416
Okay, thank you.

680
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,730
- [AI] Sumo Logic Dojo AI running on

681
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,380
Amazon Bedrock agent code.

682
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,260
Here we have the Sumo
Logic clouding console

683
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,960
where a number of insight has five alerts.

684
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,570
Before performing any
manual investigation,

685
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,830
the SOC analyst agent has
automatically triaged each insight

686
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:42,360
with a verdict assigned as
benign, suspicious, or malicious.

687
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,110
Jumping into an insight,
AI investigation details

688
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,970
are immediately surfaced.

689
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,989
Provide concise context to
help understand this event.

690
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:54,810
All helps to the SOC analyst agent.

691
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,610
Along with the AI verdicts,

692
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,785
the agent recommends
adjusted severity level

693
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:04,470
using evidence backed reasoning
from inside data signals

694
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,910
and enrichments by synthesizing
the related signals,

695
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,246
a concise narrative style
summary is generated.

696
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:15,994
Allow analysts to quickly
understand what happened,

697
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,440
who was involved, and why it matters.

698
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,920
Specific detail, key
findings are also presented

699
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,290
providing analysts an immediate
sense of threat impact

700
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,700
with deeper analysis required.

701
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,290
The SOC analyst agent support
hypothesis based investigation

702
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,620
using your log data
and the help of mobile.

703
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,751
Launching directly from insight.

704
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:44,160
We can begin to use natural
language to investigate further.

705
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,040
Notice that the context of our incidents

706
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,312
is already inherited.

707
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,050
To dive a little deeper, we will go ahead

708
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,053
and ask Mobile to run
a quick investigation.

709
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,220
Leveraging our security
data, the agent will begin

710
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,430
to automatically execute his own analysis

711
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,380
by running several search queries

712
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,527
and summarizing its findings.

713
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:10,680
With the help of SOC analyst
agent running our AgentCore,

714
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,900
we can bring agentic AI reasoning

715
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,680
directly into your security
operation workflows

716
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,670
and it enable analysts
to effectively capture

717
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,993
the information they need.

718
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,220
Here we have another cloud SIM insight

719
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,650
that has notified us in Slack.

720
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,902
Before requesting more
details about this event,

721
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:35,790
we will take a look at what
Sumo Logic tools are available

722
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,440
for our MCP server.

723
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,230
Prompting it directly
from our Slack thread.

724
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,080
In the background, our Slack
application is leveraging

725
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,890
an orchestrator agent
hosted on AgentCore runtime,

726
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,440
which then communicate
with AgentCore gateway

727
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,630
via standard MCP protocol.

728
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,820
The AgentCore gateway is fully managed

729
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,740
and is security integrated with

730
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,730
Sumo Logic platform
APIs and Dojo AI agents.

731
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,860
Several actions are ready to use,

732
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,920
like capturing more
details related to insights

733
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,040
and running queries
directly in Sumo logic.

734
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,860
As multi-tool calls are
supported, we will go ahead

735
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,560
and ask mobile to provide
any triage details

736
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,660
that this SOC agent generated

737
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,830
and update the status of
this insight to in-progress,

738
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,470
we quickly see our triage
details summarized,

739
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,040
in response that our
change has been reflected.

740
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,680
To capture more details,
we will request a list

741
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,533
of related entities tied to this event.

742
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,720
Here we can see any user
account, IP, device information

743
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,049
and other entities
associated with this insight.

744
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:44,010
We can even run search
directly into our raw logs

745
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,120
in Sumo logic,

746
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,050
and see if other users may have
experienced similar activity

747
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,343
in the last three days.

748
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,990
Upon retrieve of the results
from our log search, we see

749
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,620
that other users has
in fact been impacted.

750
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,770
To wrap this up, we'll add
a comments to the insight

751
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,953
stating that other users
appear to be affected.

752
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,858
Hopefully this gave you a clear picture of

753
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:11,580
how you can leverage
Dojo AI either directly

754
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,070
in Sumo Logic console or from within

755
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,990
your favorite apps and tools.

756
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,083
All thanks to the help of
Amazon Bedrock Agent Corp.

757
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,690
Thank you.

758
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,340
Pretty interesting demo, isn't it?

759
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,173
Yeah.

760
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:28,620
So for the next couple slides

761
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,050
I'm gonna show you how we build this.

762
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,190
Let me start with a Sumo Logic platform.

763
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,350
From the left hand side, you can see

764
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,510
we ingest our customer's data,

765
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,260
telemetry data for the main
part, regardless where they sit.

766
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,450
Could be in Amazon Cloud, Google Cloud,

767
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,998
whatever clouds you are living in.

768
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:50,099
seamlessly ingest this
at a super high scale

769
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,720
into our platform.

770
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,000
And then we have a single pane of glass

771
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,090
to operate and monitor
and analyze your data

772
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,650
for your applications.

773
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,570
And then in the middle, as you can see,

774
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,630
we have a rich set of analytics tool sets.

775
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,881
So we automatically convert
the raw telemetry data

776
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:10,260
into meaningful insights
and recommendation.

777
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,060
So the team can make a decision.

778
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,860
And then on the right hand side,

779
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,280
we have hundreds of autobox
integration for actions.

780
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,330
For example, reporting, ticketing

781
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,480
and remediation

782
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,000
or containment.

783
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,171
So, and last but not least,

784
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:31,170
the top tier which I
highlight is the Dojo AI.

785
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,530
Is the multi-AI agent
systems that we're building

786
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,930
and are launching this year.

787
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,080
So what is Sumo Logic Dojo AI?

788
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,930
Dojo is a Japanese world to
demonstrate a collections

789
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,700
of intelligence...

790
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:53,161
... Intelligent personas are
leaving and working together

791
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,440
and learning their skill as they go.

792
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,270
So I think that's a perfect
fit to our agentic AI visions.

793
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,167
So we are..

794
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:04,920
... Dojo AI in a nutshell,
is a multi-AI agent systems

795
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,470
for proactively doing the security

796
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,863
and incident analysis and response.

797
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:13,440
So there's the four important principles

798
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,120
when we build Dojo ai.

799
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,040
First we treat a Dojo AI
agent as the digital teammates

800
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,040
for the existing security operation teams.

801
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,860
They can work seamlessly with the humans

802
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,990
and other agent using natural language.

803
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,260
Multi-turn, conversational
natural language interface.

804
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,680
And very, very important why
we decide to use agentic AI

805
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,303
versus just the vanilla generative AI.

806
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:39,960
Because we want each of our agent

807
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,030
to be fully contextually aware.

808
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,423
they can seamlessly share the
context, update the context

809
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,690
between the agents as
well as automatically

810
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,360
make decisions about
which tool should I use.

811
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,800
And the agent also being smart
to discover tools as we go.

812
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,020
And the tool also being able to access

813
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,950
very important domain
knowledge in our use cases.

814
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,050
So can dynamic access domain knowledge,

815
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,000
and grounded with domain knowledge.

816
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,913
Last but not least, our
agent are secure by design.

817
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,720
So let me show you the architecture about

818
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,000
how this whole things look like.

819
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,490
Let me start with the
Sumo Logic platform tier.

820
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,290
There are three pillars of resources

821
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,140
exposing as MCP based resource.

822
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,560
The first one is what do
we call the platform APIs.

823
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,044
We have hundreds of open APIs, public API,

824
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:35,227
expose our functionality
of the core data platforms

825
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:38,520
and then in the middle
this is the new family

826
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,260
of Sumo Logic platforms,

827
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,470
we call it dojo AI foundries.

828
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,270
And as you can see, at this reinvent

829
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,120
we announced three agents (inaudible).

830
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,887
They are our query agent,

831
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,290
and seamlessly translate
the natural language

832
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,140
into highly scalable DSL.

833
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,210
We call the Sumo Logic query language.

834
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,791
And this is where we are
able to run natural language,

835
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:04,290
ask questions from Slack
or from our console

836
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,710
and then directly compile
into natural language queries,

837
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,240
run and bring the result back,

838
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,628
and summarize in natural language too.

839
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:15,840
Summarization agent is
another one where (inaudible).

840
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,830
And then the interesting part
about the more autonomous

841
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,730
and SOC analyst agent is where
you see in our triage agent

842
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,100
as well as our investigation agent,

843
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,530
you can fire up a pretty
high level question

844
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,410
to say run a quick investigation for me

845
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,312
or run a deep investigation

846
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,610
and then the agent behind the thing,

847
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,590
leveraging the reasoning models,

848
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,963
able to create a plan, investigation plan

849
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:42,605
and then generate actionable steps.

850
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:46,380
Each step can automatically
run by our platform

851
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,880
and bring the result back.

852
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,160
So human is also in the loop about this

853
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,230
which make these things very interesting.

854
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,264
The third pillar is our MCP servers.

855
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:57,270
So why we need MCP server?

856
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,670
We see there's more and more

857
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,420
new context during the investigation.

858
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,860
We want to be able to expose them

859
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,710
as a resource to the other tiers.

860
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,400
And so this is pretty much
our Sumo Logic platform tier.

861
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,560
And then let's look at our client tier.

862
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,780
The client tier is quite
interesting, as well,

863
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,720
in our default personas we have developers

864
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,610
or the so-called SREs,

865
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,080
they're looking at the code

866
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,820
and then they want to be able

867
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,280
to without leaving their own IDs,

868
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,387
whether it would be a VS code
or cursors or the cloud code.

869
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:34,119
So they want to be able to
directly our platform APIs

870
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:38,970
or using our AI agent
remotely through MCP protocol,

871
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,290
which is pretty interesting.

872
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,962
The other part of the
personas is our so-called,

873
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:46,080
the IT analysts, security analysts.

874
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,680
And they want to stay within
their favorite Slack tool,

875
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,653
for example, they want to be able also

876
00:41:51,653 --> 00:41:52,590
to do it in the same thing.

877
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,070
How can I reach the
powerful Sumo Logic platform

878
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:59,402
to build the integration use cases.

879
00:41:59,402 --> 00:42:02,783
And each of those are
customers, type of customers.

880
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:07,140
They're also building
their own custom AI agent.

881
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,810
And last but not least,

882
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:14,100
look at our Sumo Logic platform
tiers, or the partner tiers.

883
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,090
More and more partners are
also building their own MCP

884
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,824
servers that became publicly
addressed, security managed.

885
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:25,076
But then we can enable
end-to-end integration

886
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,600
using the using these things.

887
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,800
So we're missing something here.

888
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,760
How to make this super
complex multi-tier cross

889
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,950
org kind of things working together.

890
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,760
How to enable the agent-to-agent
collaboration using MCP.

891
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,250
And the answer is AgentCore gateway.

892
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,650
And so there is two,

893
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,750
at least, there's two integration patterns

894
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,730
enabled by this architecture.

895
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,340
The first one we saw is
coming from the client side.

896
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,680
The client shall be able to reach out

897
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,430
to AgentCore gateway using
the standard MCP protocol

898
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,600
to leverage either our
API or our Dojo AI agents

899
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,905
or reach out to our MCP servers.

900
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:06,420
The other way, also quite interesting,

901
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,990
our agent using the same patterns
shall be able to reach out

902
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,823
to our...

903
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:13,620
... Reach ecosystem of
partner tier, leveraging,

904
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,430
for example, Amazon has
launched nearly a hundred

905
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,170
of MCP servers

906
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,390
and there are some multi-hundreds

907
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,040
of very rich kind of tool sets.

908
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,110
And similar for our threat intel partners,

909
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,140
similar for our action
automation partners.

910
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,615
So we can, our Dojo AI
agent can now leverage

911
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:39,615
their rich ecosystem to build
a very rich integration.

912
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,410
So next I'm gonna take you
to one level step down.

913
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:47,520
I want to show you three patterns

914
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,590
to how to make these things happen.

915
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,690
The first thing, let's
start with the client tier.

916
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:56,160
As I said, we have a
Slack app and guess what?

917
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,410
Slack is not super friendly

918
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,180
with AI native things, like a cursor

919
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,870
or VS code so that we build
our client side AI agent just

920
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,700
to emulate how our client,

921
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,870
how our customers are building
their own custom AI agent.

922
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,080
And this AI agent has to be
hosted on AgentCore runtime,

923
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,530
which is a great way to
simplify a lot of things.

924
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,751
So why we need this agent with the tools,

925
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:23,133
the whole topic for today
is about using reach

926
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:24,870
data for two chains.

927
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,733
So there's three important capabilities.

928
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:32,310
We use a line graph to build
this orchestration agent.

929
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,597
The first one is called the planner node

930
00:44:34,597 --> 00:44:36,630
and then we have execution node.

931
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,330
We also have a summarization node.

932
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,030
So now let start to jump in

933
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,030
my first patterns is what are
we call the API as a tool.

934
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,090
So typically there's the two type of APIs.

935
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,780
One is the API exposed
through open API protocols

936
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,020
and AgentCore gateway happens
to natively support this

937
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,684
using open API target

938
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:03,000
and you have another type
of perhaps a more older

939
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,610
or legacy AI

940
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,660
endpoint

941
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,720
for example using avril or using GraphQL,

942
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,371
those kind of things, we
can use a lambda translator

943
00:45:13,371 --> 00:45:14,400
in between.

944
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,020
So we can translate the protocols

945
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,960
and then wire it up with AgentCore gateway

946
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,790
using the lambda target.

947
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,190
So that's the first pattern.

948
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,920
Expose API as a tool.

949
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,990
The second pattern I want to mention,

950
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,360
expose AI agent as tools.

951
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,610
This is where you see a number of

952
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,500
AI native agentic

953
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,030
AI agents.

954
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,930
They can also, simply
using a lambda target,

955
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,621
you can expose the functionality

956
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:44,670
through the lambda target
under AgentCore gateway

957
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,000
and then expose them to
the client tier agent.

958
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,530
the client tier agent will be able

959
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,980
to discover the new AI
native functionalities

960
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,621
through this patterns.

961
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:58,230
And the third patterns, also
I want to be interesting,

962
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,920
we see a growing demands
of MCP servers either

963
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,350
as a third party or as a first party.

964
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:07,050
So in that case thank you
for AgentCore gateway.

965
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,690
They just have to have did a fantastic job

966
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,210
to do this piece of heavy lifting for us

967
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,800
so we don't have to reinvent the view.

968
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,320
So they have a native MCP target support

969
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,360
as Nick and Dhawal (inaudible)

970
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,680
and even better they have

971
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,840
a better fine grain access control.

972
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,580
So in the case you want to provide

973
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,995
more custom access control policies.

974
00:46:25,995 --> 00:46:29,880
Now the fine grain access
control is your friend.

975
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,607
So those are the three powerful patterns

976
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:35,040
I want to offer with this audience.

977
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,970
And to wrap up, I want to highlight.

978
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,920
We already adopt several
important AgentCore gateway

979
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,950
features and and patterns on the left.

980
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,070
And we are in the process
of actually working

981
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,680
with this wonderful service teams

982
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,170
from AWS Bedrock AgentCore teams,

983
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,290
to evaluate and testing all
the fine grain access control.

984
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,030
We also working super closely

985
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,520
on the end-to-end OS integrations

986
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,637
and we are also exploring,

987
00:47:04,637 --> 00:47:06,900
looking for the next year,

988
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,140
we are also exploring the
next more advanced features,

989
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,810
how to leverage AgentCore memory features

990
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,540
because I mentioned it's very
important to share memories,

991
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,540
share context across agents,
or DOJO agent families.

992
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,000
And also how to enable
more advanced collaboration

993
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,310
using the A-to-A protocols.

994
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,700
So there's a lot of
exciting things coming up.

995
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,270
Just to wrap up my talk here,

996
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,329
we found AgentCore is a great way for us

997
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:37,986
as agentic application builders,

998
00:47:37,986 --> 00:47:41,550
we can now focus on our
core value proposition.

999
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:44,580
We want to build agentic
SecOps intelligence

1000
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,290
for our customers.

1001
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,440
And just to summarize the business impact

1002
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,670
by shipping the AgentCore,
shipping the Dojo AI

1003
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,540
via AgentCore, we are able to see about

1004
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,620
50% of faster analysis time

1005
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,820
up to 75 reduction into so-called MTTR,

1006
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,590
mean time to resolution.

1007
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,560
And for that we see
millions of dollars saving

1008
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,480
from the incidents to happen.

1009
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,570
So with that, if you want
to see a lot more demos,

1010
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,450
we have a live demo booth in the expos.

1011
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,710
Feel free to explore.

1012
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,050
Our demo team will show you live demos

1013
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,198
and you can try to ask all
kinds of tricky questions.

1014
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,432
Our agent will be able
to give you surprise.

1015
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:32,490
Okay, with that, thank
you for the opportunity.

1016
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,797
Turning to Dhawal.

1017
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,473
- Alright, thank you Kui.

1018
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,000
So let's go through the key takeovers.

1019
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,250
Some of the best practices I wanna share

1020
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,520
as you scale your MCP tools and agents.

1021
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,180
Always start with your user queries.

1022
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,523
Start with the agentic goals,

1023
00:48:57,523 --> 00:49:01,260
decompose your agentic
goals into agentic tasks

1024
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,509
and then start working
backwards from identifying

1025
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:08,580
the right set of enterprise
APIs, data stores

1026
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,980
and then start MCPifying them.

1027
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,980
Do not convert all of your
enterprise APIs into MCP tools.

1028
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,900
The agents are autonomous,
non-deterministic

1029
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,950
and you wanna make sure these
agents are invoking the right

1030
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:30,810
tools based on your user
queries and agentic goals.

1031
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:35,402
When you create a new MCP
tool, make sure you select,

1032
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:37,620
you create such type of tool to may be

1033
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,850
consolidate multiple APIs
into a targeted MCP tool

1034
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,793
that is aligned to your agentic tasks.

1035
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,700
Alright, now there are lots of questions

1036
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,490
about the how do you
improve the performance

1037
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,610
of the MCP tools and overall agents?

1038
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,120
Well the number one
thing that we must take

1039
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,990
into consideration is how
effective your MCP tools

1040
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:05,580
are in driving the accuracy
and reducing the hallucinations

1041
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,190
and overall driving the business value

1042
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,660
and the agentic goals.

1043
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,322
And for that it is extremely important

1044
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:15,152
to have a continuous feedback loop.

1045
00:50:15,152 --> 00:50:19,560
How well your agents are
invoking your MCP tools,

1046
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,460
how many times these agents
are invoking your MCP tools.

1047
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,204
What is the impact of these
MCP tools on the accuracy?

1048
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:29,947
That feedback loop must be closed.

1049
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:32,550
And the way how you do it

1050
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,970
is to have those matrix of

1051
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,575
the MCP tools

1052
00:50:38,575 --> 00:50:41,670
streamed into the AgentCore observability.

1053
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,640
And you have that end to
end AgentCore observability

1054
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,940
with the traceability
and a full fledged matrix

1055
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,580
of understanding how well your agents

1056
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,990
are invoking these tools.

1057
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,160
Extremely important.

1058
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,473
Now talking about the performance.

1059
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,960
The performance of the AI agents

1060
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,230
are dependent on various
different factors,

1061
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:05,730
but one of the major
factors is the LLM context.

1062
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,550
One of the major complaints
from our customers is,

1063
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,950
oh well my agents are latent,

1064
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,680
they're not responding on time.

1065
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,820
And then the first question I ask is,

1066
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,850
how many MCP tools does your agent has?

1067
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:22,850
And then how much of the
context size that each MCP tool

1068
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,920
bring in and accumulate as
an overall LLM context size,

1069
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,930
what's your MCP tool
description look like?

1070
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,270
And when I see that, it's like pages

1071
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,880
and pages of the MCP tool description.

1072
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,233
So be very cautious how you
describe your MCP tools.

1073
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,530
Prompt engineer these MCP tools

1074
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,740
because you know what
the MCP tool descriptions

1075
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,190
are extremely important in
driving the accuracy for sure.

1076
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,700
But then it could also
introduce different types

1077
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,520
of attack vectors, like command injection,

1078
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,730
or tool poisoning, or command control,

1079
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,290
or even different types

1080
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,480
of prompt injection attacks can happen.

1081
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,750
So make sure that you
are very deliberate about

1082
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:10,080
what you put there as part
of the tools description.

1083
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,410
And then you can reduce
the LLM context size

1084
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,980
by making sure that you have
that effective right size tool

1085
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,360
description for all of your tools.

1086
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,177
And this is not just it, there are lots

1087
00:52:20,177 --> 00:52:23,640
of other factors
contributing to the overall

1088
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,630
agentic performance.

1089
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,430
Obviously, I'm just trying to just

1090
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,430
go through only the tool
specific recommendations.

1091
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,220
Now there are other things that

1092
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,467
you also should consider while scaling

1093
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:37,680
with your MCP tools.

1094
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,400
Security is job zero,

1095
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,473
and when it comes to the
security of agentic AI

1096
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:46,680
it's extremely important
'cause they're autonomous

1097
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,440
and, again I'm mentioning
it, their non-deterministic.

1098
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,700
There are different ways

1099
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,520
of handling the security for agents,

1100
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,210
the delegation model, as
well as impersonation model.

1101
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,030
The impersonation model
is a very well known model

1102
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,670
where you trust an upstream service

1103
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:06,030
and then you call the downstream services

1104
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,776
by sharing the credentials.

1105
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:10,289
In a typical microservices world.

1106
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:13,710
Well that's not gonna
work out for agentic AI

1107
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,784
because these agents are autonomous

1108
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:19,470
and non-deterministic again.

1109
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,290
So you need to have this
fine grain access control

1110
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,680
with delegation model, where your agents

1111
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,890
are acting on behalf of
the end user's persona.

1112
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,370
They're assuming the role
dynamically from the end users

1113
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,070
and then they're acting
on behalf of the user

1114
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,400
without exchanging the
end users credentials

1115
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,490
or JWT tokens to the downstream systems.

1116
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:44,370
So make sure you have this act on behalf

1117
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,460
or the delegation model in place.

1118
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,861
Now in terms of the fine
grain access control,

1119
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:53,610
use gateway interceptors
that Nick introduced

1120
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,890
to have the fine grain access control

1121
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,280
of who is able to call
which tool dynamically.

1122
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,773
And then customers tell me that,

1123
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:05,850
hey, I have these growing
number of agents and tools.

1124
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,720
How do I scale?

1125
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,280
And the first thing I ask,

1126
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,975
do you have a single source of truth

1127
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:14,180
of your enterprise
approved tools and agents

1128
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,070
in a single place, as a
single source of truth?

1129
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,680
And that's where the agents registry

1130
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,749
and tools registry comes into the play.

1131
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:25,710
Whenever your developer
pushes a new MCP tool

1132
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,860
or a new agent, have the development

1133
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,580
and deployment pipeline
to your MCP registry

1134
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,410
or agent registry that does
this tools checking statically

1135
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,590
or dynamically when the
tools are being executed.

1136
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,420
When I said static tools checking,

1137
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,238
check for security vulnerabilities.

1138
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:46,440
(inaudible) problem

1139
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,790
or command injection and
tool poisoning, et cetera.

1140
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:55,790
And then make sure you use
the semantic search capability

1141
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,756
that Nick walked through,

1142
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:01,140
which is the native feature
within the AgentCore gateway.

1143
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,896
When your tools, number of tools grow,

1144
00:55:03,896 --> 00:55:07,368
your list tools, MCP
list tools performance

1145
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:09,000
is gonna take a hit.

1146
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,940
You are gonna have large
payloads being sent

1147
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,890
to your MCP clients.

1148
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,530
Use semantic search to take care of that

1149
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,890
and improve the performance
of your MCP tools.

1150
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,573
So having said that,

1151
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:24,513
there are lots of other best practices

1152
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:27,000
that I wanna just quickly project.

1153
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,833
The registry,

1154
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:32,520
the importance of having a
single source of truth for tools

1155
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,220
and agents registry, and bring in

1156
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,960
this multi-tenancy into the play,

1157
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,940
like use gateway interceptors

1158
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,570
to isolate these tenants
if you are sharing

1159
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,093
the AgentCore gateway
across multiple tenants.

1160
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,590
Alright, so here's the getting started.

1161
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,853
You can use AWS console or boto3

1162
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:55,230
and A.W.S C.L.I,

1163
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,290
and I really recommend you try
AgentCore Starter Toolkits.

1164
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,230
The really easiest way to get
started with AgentCore Gateway

1165
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,990
and integrating with each
other AgentCore perimeters

1166
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,100
as well.

1167
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,350
And here's some other bunch of resources,

1168
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,120
like there are about 50 plus resources

1169
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,530
that you can go and check out.

1170
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,900
It's not about, it's not
just about the tutorials,

1171
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,090
it's also like end to end use cases.

1172
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,480
You'll find lots of use cases
out there in this repository.

1173
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,630
And then obviously what Nick
introduced about the schema

1174
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,490
repair agent, do check that out.

1175
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,650
It'll help you in MCPifying
your existing open APIs

1176
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,800
and make sure that your schemas are valid.

1177
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,600
All right, thank you very much.

1178
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Do not forget to visit Sumo Logic booth

1179
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,700
and I really appreciate the time.

1180
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,460
If you have any questions, we
are gonna be available outside

1181
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,740
of this hall.

1182
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,780
Happy to talk, happy to
answer your questions.

1183
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,073
Thank you very much.
