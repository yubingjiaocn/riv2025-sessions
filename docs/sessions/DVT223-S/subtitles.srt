1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,420
- Hello, hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,060
Thank you, alright.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,720
Maximizing productivity
with the Amazon Q Developer.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,640
And if you've been around all week,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,473
then you'll know,

6
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:15,180
it's not called Q Developer
CLI Agent anymore,

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,700
it's actually called the Kiro CLI,

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,893
which is a lot easier for me to say.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,363
So I work for Pluralsight.

10
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:26,460
We're a company that helps people upskill

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,350
their workforce so that they can deliver

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,750
their digital transformation needs.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,700
One of the things that we did recently

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,280
is this, tech forecast,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,700
it's like a, whacking 50 page document,

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,873
but we interviewed 1500 tech executives,

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,280
IT people, and business leaders

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,270
to try and find out

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,040
what kind of challenges and skills,

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,843
gaps and issues they were facing.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,380
And you can download it as well.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,470
But what we found

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,510
was that the next phase of AI

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,820
of is of course gonna be all focused

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,963
on governance, and ethics as
well as return on investment.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,880
Cloud, of course, being the key enabler

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,100
with services from AWS like Federal

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,193
and SageMaker enabling AI for all of us.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,590
And for the last three years,

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,120
running the top technical gaps

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,133
have always been cybersecurity,

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,600
basic foundational core cloud skills,

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,140
cloud architecture skills,
cloud security skills,

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,183
and, of course, AI and machine learning.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,540
So when I read this report,

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,373
one of the things

37
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:38,520
that I thought straight away

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,590
was that it's never been more important

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,730
for all of us to keep on top

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,100
of all of these new trends,

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,763
the new skills that we all
gonna need going forward,

42
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,600
which is exactly why we're here, right?

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,530
So show of hands,

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,360
who's already done one of the following,

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,730
and it could be that you've
done multiple of these things.

46
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,623
Used Amazon Q Developer before?

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,340
Used the Q Developer CLI agent,

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,013
now called the Kiro CLI agent?

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,243
Have you used and had success
with any of the Claude models?

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,440
Or used any other coding assistant?

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,850
Alright, well you're in the right place,

52
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,810
because we're gonna find out

53
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,753
how I maximize my own
productivity with it?

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,790
So we'll talk a little bit

55
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,380
about how to get started

56
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,573
with Q Developer/Kiro.

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,170
I've got some basic simple sample prompts

58
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,070
that you can start off

59
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,630
with and adapt to make your own,

60
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,970
oh sorry, trigger happy,

61
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,963
got some demos, mistakes to avoid as well,

62
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,520
and how we can all thrive
on in this age of AI,

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,530
and keep our skills up-to-date,

64
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,090
and really succeed with it,

65
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,493
and enable it to give us superpowers.

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,800
Finally, I've got some resources

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
if you wanna learn more.

68
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,450
Alright, so when it
comes to getting started

69
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,100
with Q Developer/Kiro,

70
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
there's three different ways.

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,030
So you can use it in the AWS console,

72
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,000
you can get troubleshooting
advice from Q developer.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,550
It's getting better and better.

74
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,760
You can also use the Kiro IDE,

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,710
which is a fork of VS code,

76
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,450
if you're used to using
an IDE on the daily

77
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,410
it's a copy of a VS code

78
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,640
that's been augmented with the Kiro.

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,230
It's been Kiro vibe.

80
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,120
So it's using Claude for
the kind of the assistant

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,890
and the chat capabilities.

82
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,990
It's got the ability to hook it up

83
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,333
to AWS MCP servers as well.

84
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,110
But we are here to talk
about the Kiro CLI,

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,020
which is basically a chat agent

86
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,150
that you can use in your terminal.

87
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,780
And if you don't feel like
firing up a full on IDE,

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,110
or maybe you don't work
in an IDE very much

89
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,170
or you just like working
in the terminal, I do.

90
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,700
There's no bells and whistles.

91
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,080
It's simple and basic.

92
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,150
It does what it said on the tin.

93
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,340
So if you like working in the terminal,

94
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,503
then go with the Kiro CLI.

95
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,370
Alright, so in terms of
sample prompts to try,

96
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,830
I've got a few to share with you.

97
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,420
First of all, it goes beyond Q & A,

98
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,360
because it can actually do stuff for you.

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,180
You can allow it to take
action in your AWS account,

100
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,780
and do things like creating
a new EC2 instance,

101
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,120
that's a clone of an existing instance,

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,400
and specifying particular

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,523
security groups or VPCs et cetera.

104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,800
Help with troubleshooting.

105
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,700
Yeah, if you've got an error,

106
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,320
it could be an error with AWS,

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
or an error with Python,

108
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,490
or any other popular programming language,

109
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,323
Kiro can help you in your terminal.

110
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,690
It can read and write files
on your local machine,

111
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,300
so it can review your
CloudFormation templates,

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,150
or your IAM policies that
are within the folder

113
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,590
that you're working,

114
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,960
and suggest improvements for security,

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,583
best practice, et cetera.

116
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,260
Now, a little bit about my role.

117
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,360
So I work for a training company,

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,540
a company that enables organizations

119
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,490
to upskill their staff basically,

120
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,230
and my job is a mix

121
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,573
of kind of non-technical,
and technical work,

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,790
and I describe myself really

123
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,170
as like a cloud architect,
a builder, content creator.

124
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,900
And there's this kind of unusual mix

125
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,493
of tech and non-tech work.

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
So I work a lot with documents,

127
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,870
doing lots of research, developing slides,

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,273
developing tutorials, that kind of thing.

129
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,720
And I also do loads of hands

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,790
on technical implementation working

131
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,280
with AWS every single day.

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,320
So troubleshooting things that don't work,

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,790
trying to understand the way

134
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,550
that new products work,
that kind of thing,

135
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,890
but yet loads and loads
of troubleshooting.

136
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,290
But the good news is that
I can use the Kiro CLI

137
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,743
in every single area of my role.

138
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,070
Okay, onto my demos,

139
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,270
and I've got a few
little demos to show you.

140
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,350
First of all, I use it a lot

141
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,860
when I can't remember an AWS CLI command,

142
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,060
and I can't remember them all,

143
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,610
especially when I'm trying to stop

144
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,373
an Amazon Comprehend
sentiment analysis job.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,280
That's not a command I use every day.

146
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,620
So I can get Kiro to help me with that.

147
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,770
Let's see it in action.

148
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,490
Alright, so I'm starting a
Kiro CLI chat session just

149
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,173
in my terminal, on my Mac.

150
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,433
Next, I'm gonna select
which model I want to use.

151
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,683
Ask my question.

152
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,213
Here, it's using the AWS
documentation MCP server.

153
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,330
So it's not gonna hallucinate,

154
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,800
it's gonna give me an up-to-date answer

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,423
from the latest documentation,

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,213
and there you go.

157
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:57,840
It's given me the information I need

158
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,810
so I don't need to mess around trying

159
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,753
to use this CLI command
and making mistakes.

160
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,530
Next, I'm getting it
to help me troubleshoot

161
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,480
an error I'm getting with AccessDenied,

162
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,280
and asking it how should I
approach troubleshooting?

163
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,430
Let's see what it does.

164
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,493
Oh sorry, I went too quick.

165
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,493
And it's coming back

166
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:36,330
with like a step-by-step
approach telling me

167
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,230
what I need to check.

168
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,923
My IAM policy permissions,
S3 bucket policy, et cetera.

169
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,370
Verify Bucket Ownership.

170
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,220
It's even giving me some AWS CLI commands

171
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,930
that I can use to perform some

172
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,130
of this troubleshooting.

173
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Verify Object Lock, as well.

174
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,020
So it's very, very thorough coming up

175
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,770
with lots of different suggestions.

176
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,670
It does actually go faster than this.

177
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,930
I slowed it down from my demo

178
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,610
so I could see what's going on.

179
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,443
So then it's asking,

180
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,530
do I want further help

181
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,430
with investigating any of those areas?

182
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,410
Alright, review my IAM policy

183
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,330
for security best practices.

184
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,760
Let's see what it comes up with.

185
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,130
So once again, it's gonna read my file

186
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,170
on my local machine,

187
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,240
and give me the best practices,

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,520
pinpoint all my security loopholes

189
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,020
that I've left in that policy.

190
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,000
And there we go,

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,640
overly permissive resource specification,

192
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,470
unfortunately and it's coming up

193
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,630
with some recommended
improvements giving me

194
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,450
the code I need to actually
improve that policy,

195
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,030
and it can actually
rewrite the policy for me,

196
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,910
or write a new file, or do nothing.

197
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,413
Just give me the suggestions.

198
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,306
There we are.

199
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:06,139
It's asking me,

200
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,690
do I want it to actually
upgrade the policy?

201
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:12,900
Next, how to use boto3

202
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,780
to invoke a foundation
model in Amazon Bedrock.

203
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,776
Well, when Bedrock first came out,

204
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:18,870
it was quite difficult

205
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,010
to get your head around

206
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,630
how to actually call it,

207
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,180
how to use the SDK, et cetera.

208
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,000
I did actually try to get this

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,690
to get the Amazon Q developer CLI

210
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,895
to help me with this back in the day,

211
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:35,910
and I didn't have an awful lot of success,

212
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,580
but now with Kiro, I mean it's brilliant.

213
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,110
It gives me absolutely loads

214
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,940
of information that's accurate.

215
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,943
It's all coming from the
AWS documentation as well,

216
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,440
and less opportunity for it to hallucinate

217
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,653
because we're using the MCP servers,

218
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,683
and there we go.

219
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:59,790
It's given me the Python
code that I need to run.

220
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,650
Lots of great examples.

221
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,550
It's pointing out

222
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,350
that you're gonna need
different parameters

223
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,883
for different models as well.

224
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:12,460
There we are.

225
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,470
Okay, in my role,

226
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,620
I do a lot of testing or
testing different use cases

227
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,780
or demonstrating different use cases.

228
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,660
And sometimes I need to
create some synthetic data

229
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,610
and I can use Kiro, the Kiro CLI

230
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,060
to help me with that as well.

231
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,370
And it really quickly
creates a 100 examples

232
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,390
of synthetic data that I
can easily use to test with.

233
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,223
And it's asking me,

234
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,550
do I trust it to actually write

235
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,323
that file to my local file system?

236
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,600
Another Bedrock question.

237
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,770
What are the best practices

238
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,400
when setting a common
request body parameters?

239
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,903
Difficult phrase to say.

240
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,663
And once again,

241
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:57,213
this is gonna use the AWS
documentation MCP server.

242
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,320
This one is also actually useful

243
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,790
if you are preparing for
the AI practitioner exam

244
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,520
because this, these kind
of parameters come up.

245
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,943
Things like top-k and
top-p, that kind of thing.

246
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,333
Once again, it's using the MCP server.

247
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,880
It's asking me to trust it.

248
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,050
Do I trust it for that session

249
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,823
to actually use that MCP server?

250
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,630
And it will actually read
the documentation a number

251
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,734
of times because I'm just asking it,

252
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:34,170
I guess quite an in-depth question

253
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,020
to tell me what are the
common request body parameters

254
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,790
rather than giving anything specific.

255
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,280
So it will read the
documentation a few times

256
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,030
and come back with what
are the common parameters,

257
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,813
some best practices, some example
configurations, et cetera.

258
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,150
Create a diagram for me.

259
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,050
Sometimes in my role,

260
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,820
I've gotta create diagrams

261
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,230
to explain my rationale,

262
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,900
and my thinking to other
people in the team,

263
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,170
or to make sure that I'm
doing something properly

264
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,180
to validate my own thinking,

265
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,620
to give me a checklist,

266
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,790
checking through all the things

267
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,230
that I need to create.

268
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,830
And getting the Q,
sorry, I wanna say Q CLI.

269
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,900
The Kiro CLI to help me

270
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,810
with that is gonna save me a few minutes.

271
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,450
There's a diagrams MCP
server that you can hook in

272
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,213
and it's going to create
a little diagram for me.

273
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,920
So it's a three tier application

274
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,930
with application load balancer,

275
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,060
elastic container service,

276
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,923
and a data layer in Aurora.

277
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,323
You can see it's hooked in
the AWS diagram MCP server.

278
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:46,500
And it's gonna create
this diagram, and ask me,

279
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,550
do I want to save it to my local machine?

280
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,773
There we go.

281
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:52,990
So it saved it to my local machine.

282
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,863
And here's a diagram, it's pretty good.

283
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,220
So this would be great for me to be able

284
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,230
to have a conversation
with a colleague explaining

285
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,090
my rationale and my thinking

286
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,250
around a certain architecture

287
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,250
that I'm developing.

288
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,503
Okay, mistakes to avoid.

289
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,430
Hopefully none of these are
gonna be a surprise for you.

290
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,410
So, hallucinations.

291
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,460
AI can of course,

292
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,100
and will of course still make mistakes.

293
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,120
We don't believe everything

294
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,470
that we read on the internet

295
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,490
or hear on the internet.

296
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,900
So we shouldn't believe everything

297
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,750
that gets delivered by AI,

298
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,150
and make sure that we
fact check everything,

299
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,040
especially when we're working in,

300
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,490
you know, production systems.

301
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,173
How to avoid it?

302
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:41,520
You can make sure that
when you're customizing,

303
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,793
you're using up-to-date high
quality and relevant data.

304
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,810
And we can also use
the MCP servers as well

305
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,670
to make sure that we are grounding

306
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,343
those answers in something
that we know is correct.

307
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,980
And of course, validate.

308
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,440
So request it to give you citations

309
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,363
of where it got information from.

310
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,510
Another mistake that I hear about

311
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,880
that's quite common is just Over-reliance

312
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,440
and not approaching AI

313
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,950
with a kind of a healthy
dose of skepticism,

314
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,863
and really just an
Over-reliance without verifying.

315
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,100
So really we should all be treating AI,

316
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,740
of course, as an assistant,
not an authority.

317
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,030
It works for us, not,

318
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,863
we don't work for it.

319
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,930
And it should support our decision making,

320
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,440
not be the source of the decision itself

321
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,090
with a human deciding

322
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,340
whether this is the
right thing to do or not.

323
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,180
Of course, when it comes to data sharing,

324
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,670
when we're using the free
tier on any kind of service,

325
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,710
we should be careful

326
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,930
because often the free tier can be using

327
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,673
our data to retrain the model.

328
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,680
That was certainly true in
the case of a Q developer.

329
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,930
It was by default using the data

330
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,310
that you put in there,

331
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,930
but you can opt out.

332
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,090
So be sure to check your settings in all

333
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,590
of the tools that you're using

334
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,640
whenever using the free tier of anything,

335
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
and take care before you're providing

336
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,973
any confidential type data anyway.

337
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,883
So how do we all thrive
in this new age of AI?

338
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,360
Well, what I hear from our customers,

339
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,590
and from talking to people
here at re:Invent as well,

340
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,990
is that there really is a
rising demand for people

341
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,480
who can start using these tools

342
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,043
to give them superpowers.

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,710
Understanding their strengths,

344
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,850
and their limitations.

345
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,840
What are they great at,

346
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,340
what are they not so great at?

347
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:41,040
And it's changing all the time.

348
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,410
Being able to adapt quickly as well,

349
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,770
and being able to take on board
new things as they happen.

350
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,260
Tap adapt to changing technologies,

351
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,780
and technologies changing in the way

352
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,330
that we can and can't use them.

353
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,310
So really just having that ability

354
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,990
to kind of roll with it,

355
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,070
work effectively with these new tools

356
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,180
as well as bring context,

357
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,820
ethics and empathy, and humanity

358
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,340
to the technology that we're using.

359
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,513
Ultimately blending AI
with human expertise.

360
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,500
So my challenge for all of you

361
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,640
is to start experimenting
with the Kiro CLI yourself

362
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,580
in your own daily activities,

363
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,690
and start small

364
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,230
with some kind of
routine low stakes tasks,

365
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,480
the kind of things that
I've shown you today.

366
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,383
Validate the output that you
get with your own output.

367
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,890
And be sure to track
your productivity gain

368
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,140
so that you can understand where time

369
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,870
is being saved or time is not being saved

370
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,790
because you end up correcting something,

371
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,343
and fixing something that was so you know,

372
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,120
far away from where you wanted to be.

373
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,340
Share successes with your teams,

374
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,990
and I think also share the things

375
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,160
that didn't go so well.

376
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,363
Sharing the failures.

377
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,320
And keep experimenting 'cause
it's changing all the time.

378
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,020
And you might have used a Q Developer CLI

379
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,990
or Q Developer itself in the past,

380
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,450
and not been very impressed,

381
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,800
but it's certainly changing.

382
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,970
It's changing all the time

383
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,730
with updates happening every single week.

384
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,930
Kiro runs on Claude.

385
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,730
So if you like using Claude,

386
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,283
I would definitely
recommend giving it a go.

387
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,450
And if you'd like to know more,

388
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,250
I have a couple of articles,

389
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,700
one on the use of AWS MCP servers

390
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,880
with the Q CLI/Kiro,

391
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,700
and 10 ways that I use this technology

392
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,470
to save my time in my role,

393
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,563
and that's kind of a expanded
version of this talk.

394
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,620
If you would like to learn more,

395
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,510
you can visit us at Pluralsight

396
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,660
to find out about all the
different content that we have.

397
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,340

pretty much any certification

398
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,350
that you can imagine
when it comes to cloud.

399
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,270
Any AWS certification,

400
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,340
loads of Q developer content,

401
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,380
loads of AI content.

402
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,310
Come and have a chat with us.

403
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,480
We're at Booth 139,

404
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,600
which is right over the
other side of the hall.

405
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,310
And yeah, you can also pick up
a copy of this like document.

406
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,480
Yeah, which you have.

407
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,150
Thank you.

408
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,350
And that's it, that's all for me.

409
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,330
Thank you so much for coming everyone.

410
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,650
At the end of the day,

411
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,900
I will be hanging around here,

412
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,400
if anybody, like anyone
would like to have a chat.
