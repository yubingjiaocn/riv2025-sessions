1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:01,389
All right, all right.

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,528
Good morning, everybody. How's everybody doing?

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:05,280
Good, good.

4
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,599
So my name is Kyle Goodwin. I'm the senior vice

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,000
president of sales and operations for Spectral Cloud.

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,890
I'm excited to have with me here

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,239
today. Shiv

8
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:15,970
Arihapan

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,978
is the vice president of Global reliability

10
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,760
Engineering for Yum Brands,

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,829
as well as Ryan Good, director of reliability

12
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,190
and platform engineering, and Justin Swaggler,

13
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,649
AWS worldwide head of physical

14
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:29,670
retail.

15
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:32,429
So we're actually here today to discuss

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,590
how we together as an organ as

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,348
three organizations have reinvented

18
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:38,368
retail edge.

19
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:41,380
So we'll kick off with them actually telling us a

20
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,469
little bit about themselves. So Shiv, we'll start with

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,509
you. All right, thank you. Uh,

22
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,899
hi everyone, I'm Shiv Adapin.

23
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:48,270
Uh,

24
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,189
I'm, uh, I lead the global reliability engineering

25
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,389
at Yum Brands.

26
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:54,689
Uh, as you all know, Yum Brands owns Taco

27
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,939
Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and the Habit Burger,

28
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:59,389
and, uh, I've been with the company for

29
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,389
the last 5 years, uh, focusing on the

30
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:02,978
site reliability engineering,

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,650
instant management, and scalability for our platforms.

32
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,308
Yeah, I'm Ryan Good.

33
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:09,638
I lead our reliability

34
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,918
and platform engineering, so a lot of our

35
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,808
developer enablement, but also infrastructure,

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,058
all the, all the fun stuff that actually sells

37
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,138
the pizza, the chicken, the tacos that

38
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:19,859
we have, so.

39
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,569
And lastly, Justin Swaggler,

40
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,049
part of AWS. I serve as worldwide head

41
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,209
of physical retail.

42
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,790
So any and everything as we think about

43
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,969
technology experiences, operations,

44
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:33,388
and innovation across physical retail,

45
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:36,168
restaurants, and consumer goods, I'm

46
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:37,769
owning from that side from an AWS.

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,469
Excellent. Thanks guys. So,

48
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,120
Yum Brands runs thousands of

49
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,290
locations globally, and tech innovation

50
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,409
is happening not just in the cloud, but

51
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,730
also at the edge.

52
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,400
So today we're actually gonna explore how Yum, AWS,

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,609
and Spectral Cloud

54
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,049
are reinventing that in-store architecture

55
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,088
to deliver agility, AI, and

56
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:58,150
scalability.

57
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,668
So let's start with, with you, Shiv. What

58
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,689
sparked this transformation in the first place

59
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,760
at Yum? Yeah, um, I

60
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,799
mean, Yam is the largest restaurant chain in

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,118
the world. They operate out of 155

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,679
countries. Um,

63
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,969
the journey for selling our

64
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,118
food product has been transforming into

65
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:15,929
more of digital,

66
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:18,639
and, uh, 5 years ago when I joined Yum

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
right before joining Yum,

68
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,219
Yum decided to kind of own its own

69
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,240
technology, build their own first party technology

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
platform to run the restaurant ecosystem end

71
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,300
to end. As you kind of do that, you're

72
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,389
building your cloud platforms, your digital platforms.

73
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,699
In-store becomes such a key part of it because it's

74
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,069
a customer journey at one end and there's the restaurant

75
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,569
operations and our store operators

76
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:38,439
experience on the other end.

77
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,379
So it basically comes together to form the ecosystem

78
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,338
and we basically have been building the modular

79
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,360
product ecosystem over the last 5 years

80
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,020
and we've, uh, scaled a lot of our products we

81
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,710
call like by Bay.

82
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,800
It's scaled across, uh,

83
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,319
like 20,000+ restaurants, uh,

84
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:56,500
already. So how, how

85
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,819
is that, and, and, and I think you and Ryan can tag

86
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,819
team this a little bit, but

87
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,550
how is that increased the speed of your

88
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,580
operation, uh, up time? Has it impacted the

89
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,258
uptime agility overall?

90
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:07,610
Can you talk a little bit about that?

91
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,939
Yeah, for sure. So I think, um, especially

92
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,538
with, uh, the way that we think of platform

93
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,699
engineering and we think of building platforms

94
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,069
that are self-service, right?

95
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,490
One of the, the key things is, you know, you

96
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,500
have these operations issues in

97
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,899
the restaurants that can now be handled

98
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,330
at the level. Level one help desk,

99
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:26,429
right? They can

100
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,830
see and, and have visibility, but then

101
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,330
also the tooling to take action

102
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,919
to restart workloads that might be hung up and

103
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,469
restart those POS devices that, you

104
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:36,699
know, throw up errors

105
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,469
before even having to escalate it to some of those

106
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,969
level threes or those, those higher level engineers,

107
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,349
so you stop that cycle much faster and so you

108
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,588
get them back into business a lot quicker.

109
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,099
So yeah, absolutely huge unlock

110
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,368
for that. Yeah, I mean to add to that,

111
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,710
uh. Operating a restaurant,

112
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,909
taking orders means even if Internet goes

113
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,909
down, cloud goes down, the last

114
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,949
mode for us is running the order

115
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,429
taking process and it's important that the in-store

116
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:05,008
technology supports that it's the backbone of our sales.

117
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:06,649
Excellent.

118
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,169
So from, from AWS's perspective,

119
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,469
Justin, what are some of the

120
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,429
key architectural elements of the services

121
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,758
that make it possible to run AIML

122
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,869
workloads? Yeah, really underpinning

123
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:19,988
that comes down to creating a unified

124
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,088
kind of management system as you think

125
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,528
about Kubernetes and your applications across

126
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:25,290
any channel,

127
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:28,040
right? And underpinning that is. Amazon

128
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,759
EKS hybrid nodes which AWS

129
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,920
announced last year at reinvented

130
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,480
this time and it's really accelerating

131
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,358
the journey for customers like Yum,

132
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,798
other retailers that I engage with

133
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,579
around the world as they think about creating

134
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,379
that unified management

135
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:44,199
experience,

136
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,559
right? Yum Brands, what, 40,000

137
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,879
locations have lots of locations, right?

138
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,970
Across edge devices and all

139
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,358
those applications, right? That's a lot of

140
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:56,608
locations that have to be managed as far as

141
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:57,850
doing modernization,

142
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,290
deploying new applications. And

143
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,449
with EKS hybrid nodes powered

144
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,488
by spectral cloud, that gives you kind of a

145
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:06,488
single pane of glass, right? A

146
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:09,069
control plane to allow you to get that visibility.

147
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,798
As far as what am I running, where

148
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,970
am I having issues, how can I resolve

149
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,970
those and to do that quickly and

150
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,088
modernize that what in a period of, of

151
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,100
days or weeks versus months and

152
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,230
years that other customers are dealing with,

153
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,028
um, in the past

154
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,369
and that's fundamental because you think

155
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,369
about from a retail and consumer

156
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,309
industry standpoint,

157
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,290
you know, we as shoppers, we shop all channels

158
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,790
mobile digital voice

159
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,170
in physical locations and by

160
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,170
having that unified control plane.

161
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,879
That allows you to better manage that

162
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,959
experience from any touch point that a

163
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,920
shopper's going through.

164
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,480
So that's kind of one fundamental aspect is with EKS

165
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,519
hypernodes. The second comes down as you think about

166
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,119
like a resilient edge and AI

167
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,509
applications that you start to bring in to those

168
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:56,619
locations. So if I do model training

169
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:58,798
on a sage maker or with Bedrock in

170
00:05:58,798 --> 00:05:59,540
the cloud,

171
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:00,720
I can start to

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,559
deploy lightweight.

173
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,959
AI models or applications

174
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,000
directly at the edge

175
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:09,079
that are really custom fit to the workload

176
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,678
to the use case that I'm trying to solve and

177
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,639
again by having that hybrid

178
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:14,619
unified

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,079
architecture that really allows

180
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,119
for customers like Yum to start to bring

181
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,379
those applications into their stores.

182
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,459
Thanks, Justin. So

183
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:26,040
we talk a lot about being better together

184
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,420
just across the industry.

185
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,759
So from a, a collaboration perspective,

186
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,338
this obviously spans Yum,

187
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,278
Spectral Cloud, and AWS.

188
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,920
So how do, what is each partner's role? So

189
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,045
we'll start, we'll start with you, Shiv. But what,

190
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,363
what do you, how do you think each partner's role really

191
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,725
shaped the overall solution?

192
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,363
Yeah, I mean, I think it's, we couldn't build

193
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,403
everything. That's the fundamental part of it. While we own the

194
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,403
first party technology and platform, we had to choose

195
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,564
the right partner solution for

196
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:52,605
our architecture, the ecosystem that we're building

197
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:55,189
in. Uh, ADBS4 has been, uh,

198
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,730
a very strong partner for over the years, and,

199
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,939
uh, what we do is like essentially we,

200
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,399
we work with them closely, we bring our solution

201
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,790
roadmap architecture

202
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,160
together, and then what, uh, ADBS

203
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,199
does really well for us is like connect us,

204
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,730
essentially do the matchmaking with appropriate

205
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,028
solutions that's out there. It's just not like one

206
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:15,048
solution go with this is like you got all these options that

207
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,129
you can try it out and etc. is one of those things where we

208
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,379
had a. Uh, solution, I think you mentioned, uh,

209
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:20,019
right, Justin,

210
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,910
we gotta start thinking about the in-store

211
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,298
or the edge workloads, not as separate,

212
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,009
it's part of the cloud ecosystem

213
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:29,579
because the second you start thinking about it as, uh,

214
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,548
something different,

215
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,230
then you start, uh, fragmenting

216
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,428
your solutions and that's kind of where bringing

217
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,428
in like a

218
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,949
Kerics-based solution, some of those things,

219
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,410
becomes more critical for us.

220
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,410
Any anything to add, Ryan? Yeah, I

221
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,569
think that's exactly it. It's, it's having a

222
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,230
thought partner

223
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,009
in AWS that can bring us to those

224
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,480
different solutions is huge, right? Um,

225
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,730
not only that, like we, we do, we

226
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,809
can't see everything. We don't have those

227
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,858
relationships with a lot of vendors, and so they,

228
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:00,369
again, like she said, are the matchmakers

229
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,220
when it comes to that.

230
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,608
But then, you know, to the point of like, all

231
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,290
right, we have.

232
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,994
You know this, this ecosystem that we've been building

233
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:09,173
that that the same teams

234
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:09,975
that build

235
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,595
for the cloud also need to

236
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,694
be able to build for the edge right so we can

237
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,355
with that kind of uh partnership

238
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,514
and single layer that single pane of

239
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:20,134
glass

240
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:22,613
have the same teams building workloads and

241
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,653
AI whatever that might be

242
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,954
all the way through our entire ecosystem so yeah

243
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,069
it's huge. Yeah, I mean, in general

244
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,689
from an AWS standpoint, partners are fundamental

245
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,450
to how we help customers

246
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,928
like young brands

247
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:38,808
being able to provide the right type of

248
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,440
ISVs and partners like a Spectral cloud

249
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,009
to tackle some of those meaty challenges

250
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,609
underpinned by AWS and Amazon

251
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:47,889
services,

252
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,729
but then also how can we be that strategic

253
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,109
partner with you.

254
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,580
To go even beyond just from a

255
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
spectral side, right? How do we think about bringing in the

256
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,739
AI if we're looking at computer vision

257
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,168
and IOT and Agentic

258
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,769
inside of your containers,

259
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,298
right? How can AWS build on top of that

260
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,298
with you, powered by spectral

261
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,479
cloud to then

262
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,859
really create that unlock? So it is truly a

263
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,940
1 + 1 equals 3 long

264
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,979
term. Yeah, I think, uh, just to add on

265
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,200
a little bit to that is like connecting us even with

266
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
other customers that are doing some of these

267
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,440
things, you know, we think about reliability

268
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,658
and you think about as we start to look at

269
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:25,979
scaling these things to the edge.

270
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:28,668
We can't be everywhere and so even that

271
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,668
example I gave about, you know, level ones

272
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,629
and being able to click some buttons and restart pods,

273
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,989
eventually that needs to be automated, right? And so

274
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,989
going out and being connected with

275
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,190
customers that are already doing some of those things

276
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,629
and learning from them and best practices

277
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,629
and, and what models to use and

278
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:44,609
like all that kind of stuff,

279
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,149
right? Like that's where getting in those rooms and

280
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,149
making those connections is, is key for that.

281
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,739
Got it. That's actually a good segue to kind of

282
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,739
the, the, the sub part of the question which

283
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,859
is what we see a lot in the

284
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,158
industry is aligning

285
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,580
enterprise needs with, with Edge

286
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,979
and AI innovation. What lessons

287
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,979
did you guys learn in that process from

288
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,139
a young perspective?

289
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,190
Yeah, I mean, I'll, I'll jump in here, uh,

290
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,428
so one of the things that we wanted to do is

291
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,719
like Edge

292
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,989
is a solution that gets into the

293
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,149
restaurant that stays there for like 5 years, 10

294
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,690
years, then how do you build for modernization

295
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,298
scalability with that?

296
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,168
So

297
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:24,428
one of the ideas and remember Ryan, myself

298
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,469
and a couple of our team members early on before

299
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:28,590
going into the solutioning phase is we

300
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,788
have to extend the edge into the cloud.

301
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:32,129
Think about a world where.

302
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,729
Your 8 servers also a container

303
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,349
like it's just a note running in the restaurant

304
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,969
and what it would take to scale the workloads from Edge

305
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:39,619
into the cloud

306
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,479
that was kind of like the key key underpinning

307
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,548
of like futureproofing our technology, right?

308
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,690
Like otherwise 5 years later, 10 years later, all

309
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,950
these new hardware comes in a lot more efficient.

310
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,558
Then you just can't truck roll

311
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,460
everywhere to go recycle all those things

312
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:54,408
so that was

313
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,029
definitely a tricky one where keep the cost low

314
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,210
if you do want to extend it, build it modular in

315
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,298
a way where you do this and then make sure

316
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,609
that it's future proofd enough to leverage

317
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,029
the infinite scale of the cloud

318
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:07,408
that you normally want to use there for. I, I think

319
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,460
to build on that right with, with what you've

320
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,210
done here with Spectro, right? That's fundamental.

321
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,529
That's part of. Your foundation, you know, if we want to bring

322
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:15,129
in AI,

323
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,759
if I want to bring in all these cool agentic

324
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,700
capabilities, but I don't have the foundation

325
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,048
set up correctly, like you're setting

326
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,090
yourself up to fail, right? So

327
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,090
a lot of our customers are realizing the

328
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,330
potential of, yes, I need to modernize. I

329
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,308
need to better connect and unify

330
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:31,548
my edge,

331
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:34,469
my Kubernetes into the cloud, etc.

332
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,330
so that I can streamline that.

333
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,729
Reduce my IT overhead costs

334
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,250
by a significant amount,

335
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:41,769
have full resiliency,

336
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,269
low latency,

337
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,149
no downtime, so that then

338
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,349
I have that foundation built to

339
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:50,509
then start to do like those proof of

340
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,629
concepts, right? Starting small,

341
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,019
scaling it from there, and then driving

342
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:55,808
further value.

343
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,830
100% unlocks a lot more workloads

344
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,029
that we haven't thought about yet. We have use cases that we're building

345
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,070
based off of, but you have the infrastructure now.

346
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:03,960
Now you

347
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,408
the time to market for a new functionality feature

348
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,750
drastically reduces when you have the infrastructures

349
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,288
ready to go.

350
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,489
So all, all of the hard work that we're

351
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,109
doing here is really

352
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,649
in my mind about a few things, but we'll talk about one

353
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,729
here which is improving the

354
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,330
customer experience, right?

355
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:21,509
And so.

356
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,500
In knowing, and Ryan, this is for you, knowing

357
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,798
that Yum is prioritizing, you know,

358
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:29,109
AI and GPU workloads overall,

359
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,519
can you give us some concrete examples of how AWS

360
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,658
and Spectro together

361
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,038
are actually doing that for Yum?

362
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,558
Yeah, so I think um one of the

363
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,879
big things is, you know, when you think about real-time

364
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,038
data analytics. Right? Like, a

365
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,509
lot of times right now, especially if we don't have this

366
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:45,599
stuff running at the edge,

367
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:48,219
you're having to ship that up to the cloud to do your analysis.

368
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:50,000
It may not be relevant

369
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,769
anymore, right? By the time you get that

370
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:55,239
information down to those store managers

371
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,619
or to those franchisees,

372
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
OK, cool, that's a week old. There's nothing

373
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,219
I can do for that, right?

374
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,769
So as you look at kind of where it's going in the

375
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,808
future of being able to analyze

376
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:06,629
that real-time locally,

377
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,969
they can start to take action then and then you start

378
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,798
to build agents and you start to be able to,

379
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,190
to say, OK, now automatically take action,

380
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,048
that's gonna allow those store managers

381
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,168
or store employees to focus on the things that matter,

382
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,808
which is the customer experience, right?

383
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,399
If you, if you think about retail and you think of,

384
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,229
like I remember back in the day when I worked. And retail

385
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,460
and my manager would be in the office

386
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,609
running those reports constantly, right? Like

387
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,820
every 20-30 minutes they disappear, they'd

388
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,899
be gone for an hour and they'd come back, oh, here's the latest

389
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:34,759
sales report.

390
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,058
What if all of that was just automated and they had the

391
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,058
action they could do all of that, they could spend

392
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:41,099
time with the customers, they could be out there greeting

393
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:41,840
them, they could

394
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:44,739
really enhance their experience

395
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:46,759
coming into your retail store

396
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,960
or into your restaurant.

397
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,729
And then you have our other line employees

398
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,889
who can focus on making better quality food. They

399
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,009
can focus on the things that matter

400
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,389
to them rather than,

401
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,969
oh shoot, uh, we're out of tacos. Uh, we're

402
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,000
out of tortillas. I was about to go there. I was about to go

403
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,288
there with tacos, right? Exactly. So like

404
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,649
those things can really hamper

405
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,649
the operations. And if you take all of

406
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,779
that out of their mental

407
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,359
load and they just have smooth

408
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,479
operations, customers are gonna benefit. The

409
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,428
employees are gonna benefit.

410
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:16,570
Everyone's gonna benefit.

411
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:19,048
Yeah, I mean one thing I'll add on to that is like the

412
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:21,408
customer experience is one thing, the team members

413
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:23,529
experience is easy as equally important

414
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,048
to us.

415
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,349
That's how you get the best food out to the customers

416
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,908
as fast as possible and our goal was always

417
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,250
just make the technology work. It's like

418
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,298
email like somebody said it before, it just, it should work

419
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,750
and how do you make it, make it happen is basically

420
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,269
build that right infrastructure underneath it then

421
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,548
you kind of like remove the technology from

422
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,019
how things work where it's not in your face.

423
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,690
You're not having your restaurant, uh, team members

424
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,835
become. Like their own tech people like trying to unplug

425
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,474
and replug wires and things like that.

426
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,955
So I, I mean, to me like the operational

427
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:54,075
side, the benefit that comes out of that has

428
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:55,404
been a huge thing for us

429
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:57,715
outside of, I mean, there's definitely business use cases that we can

430
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:00,033
run from an AIML workload perspective, but

431
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,195
we have our own, like half of our containers, our own

432
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:04,195
internal containers, core containers, because

433
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,835
we could do so much more observ, streamlining

434
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,375
the connectivity back into the cloud,

435
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:10,933
like funneling through 111 node

436
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:13,024
up rather than having like 20 different devices

437
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,695
shipping logs to the cloud, things like that.

438
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,889
I mean, of consumer industries, right, retail,

439
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,710
restaurants, consumer goods, right?

440
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,239
Providing that real-time

441
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,058
proactive visibility. If an agent

442
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,918
or your

443
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,418
containers can tell me an issue

444
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:29,168
before I,

445
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,080
as a

446
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
restaurant manager, as a store manager,

447
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,158
even before I know.

448
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:37,038
And be able to respond to that, that's driving

449
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:39,129
value, right? I mean, if your cookers

450
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,168
fail, right, and you don't know until

451
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:42,190
after it happens,

452
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:43,489
that's bad,

453
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,168
right? And how by deploying

454
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:47,509
this kind of modern unified

455
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:48,840
infrastructure,

456
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:51,288
it can start to predict it ahead of time so that I

457
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:53,330
can resolve it ahead of time, right, which drives

458
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,729
the experience. Operational stability part is

459
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:58,048
workloads that basically saying rather than saying something's

460
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,700
wrong, it says what exactly is wrong,

461
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,215
then you're jumping into the recovery part of it. As fast

462
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,293
as you can and it's critically important

463
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:05,154
given, I mean,

464
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,923
yes, digital commerce is growing, but

465
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,154
even younger generations still want

466
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,394
the experience inside of stores, right?

467
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,754
So again, you can really focus on

468
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,303
that experience, making sure it's seamless,

469
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,455
it's connected, and that it's providing a

470
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,994
great experience for your shoppers.

471
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,460
So Justin, since you're on the mic,

472
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,229
technology is rapidly evolving, especially as we keep

473
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,269
talking about with AI

474
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,830
and, and really data-driven retail overall.

475
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:32,830
How do you see cloud to edge architecture

476
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,210
adapting and evolving

477
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,548
over the next few years to keep retailers

478
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:38,389
like Yum actually ahead of the curve?

479
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,769
Yeah, I, I, I mean, Agente is going to be a

480
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,879
big area that's coming over the next couple

481
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,168
of years. We're starting to build that now with customers

482
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,279
as we think about in physical locations,

483
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,690
but I mean, a lot of the research that we're seeing

484
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,849
across the industry, I mean, 90% of retailers

485
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:54,349
are going to be investing in AI algorithms

486
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,889
at the edge. They're going to be deploying

487
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:57,750
that to reduce

488
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:00,369
costs in IT. They're going to be doing that

489
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,450
to improve workforce efficiency,

490
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:03,389
make them,

491
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,000
you know, even if they save 30, 40 minutes of

492
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,689
their time.

493
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:09,167
In the day and they can focus on the experience,

494
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,548
right? So those are the trends that are shaping

495
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:14,648
how customers like Yum need to architect

496
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,928
and the types of applications they need to

497
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:19,087
build to be able to promote some of that.

498
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,888
So in essence, I mean the evolution

499
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,239
is going to be starting that whole real time,

500
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:26,019
right? I have that infrastructure.

501
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,588
I'm now capturing IOT data,

502
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,979
all this other data. I'm able to analyze

503
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,059
it in real time. I'm able to

504
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,219
respond, whether it is solving an

505
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,118
issue, whether it's personalization,

506
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,838
retail media,

507
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:39,900
engagement,

508
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,459
etc. to be able to really

509
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,420
create a. Much more seamless

510
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,400
experience not just for the shopper but

511
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,709
also your workforce as well.

512
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah, one thing I'll add is there's two parts, right?

513
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:51,838
One is

514
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,199
the small language models that's locally

515
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,799
running. The other one is

516
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,318
the spaghette for the connectivity that

517
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,219
allows to take

518
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,789
a big workload, ship it out to the cloud asynchronously,

519
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,039
get the response back, and you need that edge

520
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,699
component to be able to play that role as well.

521
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,868
All right guys, so we're coming, coming up on

522
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,949
time. Quick rapid fire. We'll start with

523
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,949
you, Shiv. What's one piece of advice you'd

524
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,949
give to other tech leaders trying to modernize? How

525
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:15,969
do they not get left behind?

526
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:17,130
Yes, I think.

527
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:19,578
Understand it, like thinking through the ecosystem

528
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,828
and adding those puzzle pieces is gonna be

529
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:22,650
such a key part.

530
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,949
It's so hard to take all these pieces

531
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:26,219
and try to make it work together.

532
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,630
So, uh, we do this ecosystem diagram

533
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,858
where everything just needs to connect and loop back in. Nothing

534
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,199
just stays on the site somewhere.

535
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:34,630
So I think that's such an important vision part of it.

536
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,848
I, I say that building things is now easy.

537
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:39,029
It's the thinking, the strategy part is the hard now.

538
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,779
Awesome, Ryan, one piece of advice. One

539
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,890
piece of advice would be lean in to,

540
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,459
to just trying things. I think you can't,

541
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:48,809
you can't be afraid to just try something new and,

542
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,289
and put it out there, um, and

543
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,338
I think the strategy thing is exactly it.

544
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,180
Like, think about all of those,

545
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:56,719
the things you're trying to solve,

546
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,739
look at it as like a multifaceted.

547
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,880
Piece, not just like a single slice, right? You

548
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,449
think about

549
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,809
all of the aspects of that thing that you're trying

550
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:05,449
to solve

551
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:06,348
customer,

552
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,809
employee, business, like all of that

553
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:09,588
is part of it.

554
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,328
Hopefully then just leaning in on trying

555
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:14,358
some of those things and, and realizing you're not gonna

556
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:14,920
get it right,

557
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,449
but if you build it in a way to be modular,

558
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,049
you can enhance it later. Awesome, Justin.

559
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, one of our Amazonian principles is around

560
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,828
starting small,

561
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:26,279
right? Test it out, proof of concept,

562
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,598
explore, right? Be a bit curious

563
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,750
around what can technology like

564
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,660
a hybrid approach

565
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,500
from an edge and cloud,

566
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,259
what can that unlock for you? Start small

567
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,759
and then scale it from there. But

568
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,338
also

569
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,618
modernization

570
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,078
like this is a meaty challenge,

571
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,479
right? It can feel overwhelming of

572
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,598
like, wow, I really need to completely change

573
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:48,338
what I'm doing.

574
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:51,000
Right? And that's why it's important to start

575
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,029
small, try that out, and

576
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,328
slowly start to slice away

577
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:57,949
at bringing those kind of capabilities and that

578
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,029
with a strategic view long term,

579
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:02,269
you know, as Shiv and Ryan have talked about and

580
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,390
starting small, I think that helps set

581
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,368
the foundation

582
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,250
for allowing to really accelerate

583
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,828
overall modernization.

584
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,890
Excellent guys. So what you guys have heard

585
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,949
today is really the power of 3

586
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,368
organizations coming together for one mission,

587
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,880
and that mission was to help Yum deliver

588
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,529
consistent,

589
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,088
reliable, and innovative experiences

590
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,088
to their customers.

591
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,630
So give them a round of applause

592
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,489
for what they've been able to deliver.

593
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:31,578
And, and overall, we've really, AWS

594
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,140
provides that global foundation, global scalable

595
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,818
foundation,

596
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Spectral Cloud delivering that operating layer

597
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,439
from a Kubernete's perspective,

598
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,219
and then Yum bringing the vision as Shiv has

599
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,529
talked about, as Ryan has talked about, really driving

600
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,689
with that strategy

601
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,309
that pushes all to reinvent.

602
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,509
So if we can make infrastructure invisible,

603
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,809
we can accelerate transformation. So

604
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:52,519
thank you all.
