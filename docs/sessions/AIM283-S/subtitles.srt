1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,860
- Okay, so what we're gonna
talk about today is ServiceNow,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,740
the AI Control Tower for
business reinvention,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,070
and AWS, the world's leading
cloud computing platform,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,380
together, powering AI-driven workflows

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,943
on the cloud built to scale.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,340
So let's talk about
why AWS and ServiceNow.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,440
So there are three things:

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,390
Savings, innovation, and impact.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,190
And first, savings.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,460
So you can run ServiceNow
directly on AWS cloud.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,560
How many people knew that?

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,390
This was launched last year.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,653
One, okay.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,663
Three, great.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,750
And so what's great about this is,

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,650
one, you can meet your data residency,

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,360
your performance requirements,

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,850
and burn down your customer requirements,

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,700
and be connected to your cloud strategy.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,890
This is amazing for so many customers,

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,710
they love being able to
procure through marketplace,

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,840
they love being able to decrement the PPA.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,790
If you have a cloud strategy,

24
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,800
your governance compliance audit

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,690
is so much easier on one cloud

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,720
versus spread across a
zillion different clouds,

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,250
and then innovation.

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,660
So what we'll talk about today

29
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,780
is we have over 100 integrations

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,810
with ServiceNow products and AWS products.

31
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,030
They are out-of-the-box integrations.

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,030
So anytime you're using a
AWS SiteWise, AWS Connect,

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,410
Redshift, like you name it,

34
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,660
we have an integration
with a ServiceNow product,

35
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,930
and many of our customers
are super jazzed about that.

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,393
DXC is one that is using that today.

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,900
Then let's talk about impact.

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,200
So this is all about
accelerating time to value,

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,240
and we've proven deployments

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,500
with Bell Canada, with
Pearson, with DXC, with Boomi,

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,730
that customers are already
using these integrations,

42
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,660
are excited about how they're
impacting their end customers,

43
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,830
and we'll talk about that
more with the DXC interview.

44
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,000
So the next chapter of enterprise
transformation is here.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,320
AI, data, and workflows
all unified on one platform

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,230
that replaces chaos with clarity.

47
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,060
This is the ServiceNow AI platform

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,943
where intelligence is not
added, but it is built in.

49
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,570
The big picture is that AI is everywhere,

50
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,450
and it's very fragmented.

51
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,420
Companies are racing to launch AI agents

52
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,060
and they end up with disconnected tools

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,140
and scattered data.

54
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,360
So ServiceNow brings that all together

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,960
on the platform you already
know, love, and trust,

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,020
and we coordinate a dynamic
network of AI agents

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,300
that turn intent into action.

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,910
It's powered by our AI orchestrator.

59
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,400
It's governed by AI Control Tower,

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
and it's your single command center

61
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
for security, compliance, and performance.

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,690
So to make AI truly transformational,

63
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,160
it needs connected data,

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,770
and that's where workflow
data fabric comes into play.

65
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,110
ServiceNow unifies all of your structured,

66
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,550
your unstructured, and real-time data

67
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,530
through Workflow Data Fabric,

68
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,650
which is connected to AWS.

69
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,810
The 100-plus integrations

70
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,510
that ServiceNow has on
its own outside of AWS

71
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,130
are integration hubs spokes.

72
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,980
So think about Workday,
think about DocuSign,

73
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,420
think about Zoom,

74
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,820
they're all integrated into ServiceNow.

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,960
Zero-copy connectors,

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,960
so AWS Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks,

77
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:31,620
those are live zero-copy connectors

78
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,790
that don't need replication,

79
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,020
that don't need complexity,

80
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,970
they're all just immediately plugged in.

81
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,640
And then external content creators,

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,470
so SharePoint, Slack, Confluence,

83
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,560
now, AI can move across every function

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,540
in every layer of your tech stack

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,513
on one platform, one
architecture, and one data model.

86
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,563
So if you think about it,

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,250
we have every industry covered.

88
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,890
We have all AI, all data, all workflows,

89
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,010
any cloud, and any system.

90
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,900
So we don't just build AI,

91
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,150
we put it to work for you.

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,530
So in financial services,

93
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,500
trust is the ultimate currency.

94
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,640
And in the digital age,
we are all built on speed.

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,040
So let's say a customer is
filing an insurance claim

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,440
or reports fraud, we, you, I,

97
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,150
don't care about the backend silos,

98
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,350
we just want to have results

99
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,780
and we wanna have the
problem fixed to resolution

100
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,100
as quickly as possible.

101
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,280
So raise your hand if you have ever felt

102
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
that an insurance claim is more miserable

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,810
than the actual accident

104
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,843
and have paid out-of-pocket
for an accident.

105
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,660
Okay, like a bunch of us,

106
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,730
because it's so, so miserable.

107
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,710
And that is something that
DXC is focused on fixing.

108
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,310
So this slide represents
the nervous system

109
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,170
of the modern financial institution,

110
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,910
and we're connecting AWS's intelligence

111
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,590
with ServiceNow's action layer.

112
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,000
So if we take claims automation,

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
which is a huge area with a ton of ROI,

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,580
in the past, a customer,

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,950
one of us who has had an accident,

116
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,993
would upload a PDF, for example,

117
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,080
and then a human would have to open it,

118
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,250
they'd have to read it,
they'd have to key in

119
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,860
all the details, and it is a very slow,

120
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,390
very error-prone process,

121
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,100
and it's extremely frustrating.

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,650
We actually have a customer

123
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,570
who is an insurance company,

124
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,510
that pays double or triple claims

125
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,700
on many of their insurance claims.

126
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,700
So they would, let's just say, you know,

127
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,590
pay the person that's
submitting the claim,

128
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,910
they would pay the mechanic,

129
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,990
and then they would pay the insurance,

130
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,840
like three different claims
and it's all backed up.

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,070
So they have, I think,

132
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,780
I forget exactly what the number is,

133
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,360
but millions and millions of dollars

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,130
that are just paid out the door

135
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,780
that they haven't been able to track.

136
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,770
These are the sort of things

137
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,720
that we're able to fix with ServiceNow.

138
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,195
So let's just use this example, right?

139
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,000
AWS Textract, instead of
having a human read these PDFs

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,030
that are uploaded by an insurance claim,

141
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,620
Textract is able to
look at all of the text,

142
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,530
ingest it through the AWS machine,

143
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,480
the policy numbers,
the amounts, the dates,

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,370
with near-perfect accuracy,

145
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,650
and then the data is
plugged into a workflow,

146
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,840
so no human has to engage with it.

147
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,900
That data isn't immediately
piped into ServiceNow.

148
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,270
We have what's called
financial services operations,

149
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,160
and it triggers a workflow which validates

150
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,330
the policy limits.

151
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,670
If it meets the criteria,
it automates the approval,

152
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,070
and the process is out of a human hands

153
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,753
and perfectly automated.

154
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,300
So this is about how are
we delivering outcomes

155
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,200
and no longer just
processing transactions.

156
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,700
So then we go into healthcare,

157
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,600
and this is what it looks
like in an actual hospital,

158
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
in a lab, in the back office.

159
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,430
On the frontend, we have
virtual patient assistants.

160
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,790
So we'll use Amazon Lex to
understand patient intent.

161
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,310
ServiceNow immediately
actions that intent,

162
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,400
books appointments for
people, pulls lab results,

163
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,320
and no human has to be in the loop.

164
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,765
On the admin side, staff onboarding

165
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,270
is an extremely
administrative painful process

166
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,430
for anybody who is in healthcare.

167
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,500
And we slash the time that it takes

168
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,960
to get a clinician
credentialed and compliant

169
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,810
by automating that data
pull from AWS databases

170
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,243
directly into ServiceNow workflows.

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Device maintenance is actually

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,420
one of the coolest joint integrations

173
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,623
that we have launched.

174
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,820
And this is where operational
technology plus IT

175
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,140
has been saving lives.

176
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,960
So let's say an MRI machine

177
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,380
is in a very busy city hospital,

178
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,940
and it's highly used.

179
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,070
So every 10 minutes or every hour

180
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,470
it is like completely booked out.

181
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,060
What happens with Amazon IoT SiteWise

182
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,990
is that they have these
little orange devices,

183
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,260
you snap that onto an MRI
machine or any other machine

184
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,660
and it can tell whether
it's vibrating too much,

185
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,100
if it's hot, if it's cold,

186
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,410
and it will flag, in the system,

187
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,680
that the machine's gonna
go down in real time.

188
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,260
And so when this anomaly is detected,

189
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,900
it's not just, you know,
logged into a dashboard

190
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,740
that nobody looks at.

191
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,870
It's then flagged to,

192
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,940
you know, let's just say a database.

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,127
With ServiceNow, it doesn't
just go to an email like,

194
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:27,720
"Oh, Courtney, by the
way, your MRI machine

195
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,553
is gonna go down."

196
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,480
Well great, like I don't
have the machinery,

197
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,130
I don't have the equipment,
I don't have the tools,

198
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,230
I have no idea how to fix an MRI machine.

199
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,190
I don't know about you.

200
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,680
With ServiceNow, we connect
it to the right technician

201
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,810
with the right tools at the right time

202
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,780
to fix the machines so that
it is constantly running,

203
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,840
it is fixed before it actually goes down,

204
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,060
and there is no downtime.

205
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,660
This also happened on the shop floor

206
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,210
of a big car manufacturer.

207
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,870
So they like to have a car
come in pieces and parts

208
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,990
and come out the door in
one minute and 38 seconds.

209
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,010
We were able to bring that down

210
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,750
to one minute and 36 seconds,

211
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,660
which is actually a really
significant time savings,

212
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,790
because the machines and equipment

213
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,490
were able to go through that same process

214
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,800
and get fixed before they actually,

215
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,900
you know, they shut down

216
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,080
the full operations of the manufacturer.

217
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,850
So these are really cool
integrations out of the box

218
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,883
being used by our customers worldwide.

219
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm gonna bring up Daniel
Stanovich from DXC.

220
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,880
He is the regional GM
of American Insurance,

221
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,260
and we're gonna talk about
ServiceNow on AWS at DXC.

222
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,045
- All right, this way?
- Yes.

223
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:49,740
(Daniel clears throat)

224
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,780
- Yeah! (clears throat)

225
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,710
- Thanks for being here, Dan.

226
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,050
- Thanks for having me.
- Such a pleasure to have you.

227
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,790
So why don't you just
give us a quick intro

228
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,400
of your background at DXC,

229
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,520
and then we'll get into-

230
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,650
- Sure.
- Your partnership

231
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,387
between ServiceNow, yes!
- So just a bit about

232
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,460
DXC insurance, 'cause
DXC is a big company,

233
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,500
but I'm referencing the
insurance piece of that.

234
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,170
So DXC insurance is the
largest insurance software

235
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,330
and BPS provider in the world,

236
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,743
by pretty much any measure.

237
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,410
I run a piece of that business,

238
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,600
which is our Life BPS that really focus

239
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
on the life and annuity insurance,

240
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,800
and it's really back office operations

241
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,590
for about 30 large life
insurance companies

242
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,823
in North America.

243
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,950
- Awesome.

244
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,100
And you oversee over 30
life insurance companies,

245
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,810
which is extremely impressive,

246
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,790
both technology and operations.

247
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,200
- Mm-hmm!
- How are ServiceNow and AWS

248
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,710
together helping you run and
scale that operation today?

249
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,440
- Yeah, so again, from
DXC insurance standpoint,

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,140
we're one of the largest
insurance users of AWS.

251
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,410
So we run, you know, it's
our cloud hosting platform,

252
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,200
we run what we call our
Assure platform on that,

253
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,180
which is kind of the connective tissue

254
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,160
that allows us to connect
into a lot of these

255
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,550
like heritage policy
administration systems

256
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,200
that we interact with.

257
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,850
Some of those we actually bring up

258
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,310
and host on the cloud, which is in AWS.

259
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,050
And then some of them
we just use the platform

260
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,090
to access with data.

261
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,590
And then what ServiceNow actually does,

262
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,090
if you think about it in layers, right,

263
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,640
you've got the Assure platform,

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,620
and then what ServiceNow
gives us is the ability

265
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,640
to orchestrate work across
those using agentic AI

266
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,090
and then also has a workflow
layer on top of that.

267
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,250
So just from, you know, a technology view,

268
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,083
that's how we view it.

269
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,400
But I think as you look
at a bigger picture,

270
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
you know, we were already
such a large user of AWS.

271
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,010
When we went out,
particularly my business,

272
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,100
I went out to look for
something to help me simplify

273
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,530
and automate a lot of
the business that we do

274
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,150
with the business process
outsourcing, right?

275
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,700
It's very people-oriented business today,

276
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,410
lot of manual process, very similar

277
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,070
to some of our customer
shops out in the market.

278
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,310
And you know, we looked at
a couple different providers

279
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,050
of that technology, workflow technology.

280
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,270
And when you think of workflow technology,

281
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,790
ServiceNow is really the
first that comes to your mind.

282
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,930
And when you look at the investments

283
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,270
and things that they're
making in the AI space,

284
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,980
particularly agentic AI,

285
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,320
it was kind of the
perfect marriage for us.

286
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
- What I love about some

287
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,040
of the ServiceNow product offerings,

288
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,510
like specific to industries,

289
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,500
is we don't build anything

290
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,060
unless there's true customer demand.

291
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,990
- Mm-hmm!

292
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,797
- And so we find companies
that are just saying,

293
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:18,900
"We're building this ourselves

294
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,160
because you don't offer it."

295
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,990
And then we realize, okay,
we're gonna go offer it

296
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,910
because there's true demand.

297
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,090
When you think about
transformation in insurance,

298
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,384
what measurable impact are you seeing

299
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,660
in terms of cost to serve

300
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,270
and productivity and claim cycle?

301
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,187
- Yeah, and I think just to
build on your point, right,

302
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,820
I mean ServiceNow brings us
that technical capability

303
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,070
and what we have is that
deep insurance knowledge.

304
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,090
- Yep.
- So we kind of paired

305
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,260
those two things together

306
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,070
and when we looked at
the businesses I support,

307
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,320
we actually identified
there's 127 workflows

308
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,660
that support a life and annuity customer.

309
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,590
- Wow.
- And we went through

310
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,040
and re-engineered those
and automated those,

311
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,180
you know, with the partnership

312
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,013
that we have with ServiceNow

313
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:00,750
and we're building
product now on ServiceNow

314
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,460
to support that.

315
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,720
And what we're actually looking at

316
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,080
is 30 to 40% improvement
in processing times

317
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,450
and same percentages in cost reduction.

318
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,450
So for us, it's massive
in terms of our ability

319
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,280
to operate more efficiently,

320
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,470
but then also really
increasing our productivity,

321
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,950
and really driving a
better customer experience

322
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,880
for our customer, right?

323
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,086
It's faster time-to-value
essentially for our customers,

324
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,530
which is great.

325
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,080
You know, you talked a lot
about a claims process,

326
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,400
you know, some of these claims processes

327
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,520
can be 60 days long to get
your life insurance claim,

328
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,860
which obviously when
you're in that situation,

329
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,510
60 days is a long time.

330
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,360
And so if we can find ways to
shorten that using automation

331
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,940
and some of the capabilities
that ServiceNow brings,

332
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,620
and in combination with AWS,

333
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,040
then we can bring that
down maybe to 10, 15 days,

334
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,020
which would be a massive
improvement for these companies

335
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,270
and for the individuals affected.

336
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,320
- That's awesome.

337
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,080
So you are building smart
apps with ServiceNow.

338
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,550
Can you talk about that?

339
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,310
- Yeah, smart apps again,
the way I would kind of...

340
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,810
Yes, we are building smart apps.

341
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,230
Smart apps are kind of broken down pieces

342
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,070
of workflows, right?

343
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,060
So if you think about a workflow

344
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,544
as a big end-to-end
process, but what we...

345
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:09,990
You know, and to implement some of that

346
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,400
can take some time, right?

347
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,280
We're finding that out
as we're implementing,

348
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,430
you know, our Assure
BPM into my shop today,

349
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,500
which is kind of the
full end-to-end workflow,

350
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,290
all 127 workflows I talked about.

351
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,370
But what smart apps are is
actually discrete pieces of value

352
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,437
that we can deliver quicker, right?

353
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:29,490
So if you're an insurance company,

354
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,710
what if I can just go and automate

355
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,172
your submission process, right,

356
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,880
your application submission process.

357
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,950
So I'm not doing the entire end-to-end,

358
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,960
what we would call new business process,

359
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,820
just automating that piece,

360
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,380
which will drive a lot
of efficiency, right?

361
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,050
So if you're getting thousand
of applications a month

362
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,910
and those are manually provided

363
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,250
so they're actually
written on applications,

364
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,770
if we can automate reading
of those applications

365
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,080
and the processing of those applications

366
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,750
to bring speed to value to you quicker,

367
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,190
that's really what a smart app is.

368
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,650
So it's allows us to kind of
incrementally deliver value

369
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,200
a lot faster, so in weeks
versus maybe months, right,

370
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,817
which is for us the real value.

371
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,980
- And how are you
prioritizing those smart apps?

372
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,080
There's 127 workflows.

373
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,160
- Yeah.
- How many smart apps

374
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,025
are there and how do you prioritize-

375
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,700
- You know what it is, it's
actually customer feedback

376
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,810
that's driving a lot of that.

377
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,750
So we obviously interact with
our customers quite a bit

378
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,870
and we just actually had a customer week,

379
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,620
which is a user conference
down in October in Charleston

380
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,240
and we got a lot of good feedback there.

381
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,870
And you pretty much drill

382
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,970
into a couple key topics
pretty quick, right?

383
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,960
It's gonna be claims,

384
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,810
it's gonna be some of the
submission process I talked about

385
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,550
that are gonna drive some
of those pain points.

386
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,750
And so that's really what's driving it,

387
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,763
is the customer demand at this point.

388
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,430
- So DXC is customer zero,

389
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,850
both ServiceNow on AWS
and of the smart apps.

390
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,200
- Yeah.

391
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,050
- How are you implementing them
internally in your business,

392
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,070
and as you start to offer
them to external customers,

393
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,090
what are you learning?

394
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,930
- Yeah, so it's interesting.

395
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,193
So again, we started our partnership

396
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:05,310
with ServiceNow about a year ago,

397
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,950
and you know, again, we've
obviously been developing

398
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,260
a lot of our kind of what we wanted to do,

399
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,400
but we initially started

400
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,540
that we were gonna replace

401
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,360
my existing workflow
system and capabilities

402
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,250
with the ServiceNow capabilities

403
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,273
and one fell swoop.

404
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,990
Like you run into in the marketplace,

405
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,550
there's a lot of technical
challenge to that

406
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,110
and it takes longer
than we would've liked,

407
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,810
especially for customer zero.

408
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,240
And so we're still doing that,

409
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,073
but in the meantime,

410
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,460
what we've actually pivoted to now

411
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,230
is doing more of a smart app strategy

412
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,090
where we can say we can drip in

413
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,450
some of this capability a little
bit faster with smart apps.

414
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,110
And so now, I'm actually able
to deliver value quicker,

415
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,610
and again, I'm replicating
what we're gonna do

416
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,600
for our customers, right?

417
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,650
So I can say, "Hey, we've
done this in my shop

418
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,150
and we've automated the claims
submission process, right,

419
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,170
we've seen these results,

420
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,810
you know, and we can do it
for you in weeks as well

421
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,280
and just spin that product up

422
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,570
while we're working on getting

423
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,670
that whole end-to-end process in place.

424
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,010
So I think it's a massive thing

425
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,870
just in terms of being
able to deliver value

426
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,970
to customers quicker in areas

427
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,250
that are really causing them pain.

428
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,270
- Awesome.

429
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,270
So last question, if we
look ahead to the future,

430
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,500
how do you see the combination

431
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,710
of AWS, ServiceNow, DXC Insurance,

432
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,290
transforming the future
of insurance operations?

433
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,660
- Yeah, I mean we look at it
as the perfect combination.

434
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,540
I mean these are the
largest players really

435
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,659
in their respective spaces, right?

436
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,460
AWS from a cloud hosting standpoint,

437
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,470
ServiceNow from a workflow technology,

438
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,630
agentic AI standpoint,

439
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,320
then DXC being the leader
in insurance software

440
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,690
and business process outsourcing.

441
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,800
For us, it was just like,

442
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,670
it's the perfect
combination of organizations

443
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,860
to solve this problem in the industry,

444
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,660
which again is really

445
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,260
is a transformational focus for us, right?

446
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,490
I mean insurance companies,

447
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,320
especially life insurance companies

448
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,690
have been doing the same
thing for decades, right?

449
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,000
They've made their problems
worse over decades, right?

450
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,850
They've bought all these
different technologies,

451
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,770
they've kind of took process

452
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,780
and added more process on top of that,

453
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,160
and where you end up is a lot of

454
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,380
what we like to call
capability debt, right,

455
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,060
which is, you know, you
take all your technical debt

456
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,907
and your processing debt
and add that together

457
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,440
and that gives you this capability debt.

458
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,960
So it really hinders the
organization's ability

459
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,600
to grow and progress.

460
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,240
And so if we can eliminate a lot of that

461
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,490
by putting in some of this
automation and agentic AI,

462
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,440
I think that's gonna make
a world of difference.

463
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,430
- Awesome.

464
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,330
Thanks so much for being here,

465
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,650
thanks for being a partner.

466
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,720
And for those of you who wanna do

467
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,510
a breakout session, like
round table, with Dan,

468
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,090
there will be an opportunity
later on this week.

469
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,588
- Great, thank you.

470
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:46,755
(audience applauding)

471
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,713
- Okay, so now we're bringing
up Ann Culver, I believe.

472
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,993
If I can change the slides.

473
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,483
Ann Culver from AWS.

474
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,213
- Hi, everyone.

475
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,730
So as Courtney mentioned,

476
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,060
ServiceNow on AWS has been available

477
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,400
since January of last year,

478
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,370
and we have a fully integrated stack.

479
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,650
So basically a mirrored stack

480
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,850
from what ServiceNow does
on their own data centers.

481
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,060
But the advantage with
AWS is it integrates

482
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,420
with all the other AWS
services that we have to offer.

483
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,120
So I'm not gonna read
through these slides,

484
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,810
but let's see if I can get
this so that you can see it.

485
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,330
So we have spent a lot of
time trying to make sure

486
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,980
that we've got the right integration.

487
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,080
So as you look at your
orchestrated workflows

488
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,490
across the enterprise,

489
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,890
those interface with the services

490
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,073
that you know and love and use from AWS.

491
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,790
And I'm not gonna go

492
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,683
into any of these in great detail.

493
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,730
So just so that you can see obviously,

494
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,090
one of the things we've been
focusing on together is AI,

495
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,570
making sure that ServiceNow is able

496
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,720
to provide AWS models
through Amazon Bedrock

497
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,830
as part of Now Assist,

498
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,873
so that integration has been complete.

499
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,470
But it allows you to choose your own model

500
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,720
and use it across the ServiceNow platform

501
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,580
running on top of AWS obviously,

502
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,880
so you can see that there.

503
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,260
One of the integrations

504
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,780
that we recently announced
is AI Control Tower

505
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,820
with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

506
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,930
I don't know if any of you
are familiar with AgentCore.

507
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,008
Yes, hopefully.

508
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:35,343
It is going to be something
you hear a lot about this week,

509
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,940
but it is Amazon's basically entry point

510
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,780
into the AI world and agentic AI.

511
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,383
So it's meant to be sort of
your one-stop entry point,

512
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,370
and that integration
again with ServiceNow,

513
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,610
enables your agentic workflow
across the enterprise.

514
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,220
So getting rid of all that siloed data,

515
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,180
making sure everything

516
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,493
is working seamlessly across the platform.

517
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,340
I think S3 was mentioned

518
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,830
in another meeting I was in earlier today.

519
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,310
But S3 is becoming,
and has been obviously,

520
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,530
a big source of data

521
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,230
where we have a lot of
partners including ServiceNow,

522
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,040
that are looking to
enable customer S3 data

523
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,450
across what they're doing

524
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,550
from a SaaS platform perspective.

525
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,880
Workflow data fabric with
S3 tables integration

526
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,050
allows you to do that.

527
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,180
So again, I'm not gonna read this

528
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,503
'cause I'm not an
engineer, but there it is.

529
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,040
The level of integrations is growing.

530
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,990
So we've been working with ServiceNow

531
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,290
for a number of years
on the integration front

532
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,800
way before ServiceNow
on AWS was available.

533
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,920
So you can see across the entire AWS stack

534
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,290
where we've got integrations here,

535
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,490
very, very extensive.

536
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,840
And if you're interested in learning more

537
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,070
about any of these,

538
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,570
please come by the ServiceNow booth,

539
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,000
we've got folks who can dive deep

540
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,563
on each one of these with you.

541
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,663
Another level of integration with IoT,

542
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,210
I'll give y'all a moment

543
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,243
'cause I'm not gonna
walk through this one.

544
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,023
But you can follow the bouncing ball.

545
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,630
And at ServiceNow
Knowledge we talked about,

546
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,830
or announced zero-copy connectors
with workflow data fabric.

547
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,790
So you can see here how it's
meant to connect data silos,

548
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,470
obviously decreased spend,
increased performance,

549
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,290
help with security, simplified compliance,

550
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,773
and obviously control your secure access.

551
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,770
And again, we've got folks at the booth

552
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,383
who can walk through this with you.

553
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,803
Oh, and that's it.

554
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,773
Okay, we're going to move
on to a panel discussion,

555
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,160
and I'd love to invite Courtney
and John back to the stage.

556
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
Courtney, are you joining
or am I doing this?

557
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,550
I'm doing this, okay, John, come on up.

558
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,533
John Licata, everyone, from ServiceNow.

559
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,330
(audience applauding)

560
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,370
- Hello.
- Hello!

561
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,310
John and I do a lot of of fun discussions

562
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,010
out there in the world these days.

563
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,020
So we're gonna talk a little bit

564
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,650
about how AI and agentic is converging,

565
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,390
and what that means for folks

566
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,130
using the ServiceNow platform,

567
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,780
as well as some of the advancements

568
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,070
that we're seeing out there in the world.

569
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,923
So let's start with maybe
a technical foundation.

570
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,910
We're hearing a lot about orchestration

571
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,490
and collaboration among AI agents.

572
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,950
How do you see AWS and ServiceNow

573
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,470
approaching multi-agent orchestration?

574
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,470
- Yeah, so I'm glad you said multi-agent

575
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,580
because we live in a world right now

576
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,670
where people talk about
an agent as a singular,

577
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,770
but we need to start
thinking about expanding that

578
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,390
and teams of agents working together.

579
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,310
So with Bedrock and you have access

580
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,910
to a lot of different AI
models, which is wonderful,

581
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,770
but I think we actually have to figure out

582
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,080
how can we have like that
single pane of glass,

583
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
how can we access to understand,

584
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,330
how could you look at
maybe the AI Control Tower

585
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,110
of ServiceNow to help govern,

586
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,870
put provisions in place, put parameters.

587
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,560
You don't want to have agentic anarchy,

588
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,820
we need rules.
- Mm-hmm!

589
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,500
- And I think sometimes that's lost

590
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,440
in today's talk about agentic AI

591
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,490
is that we need to put
parameters and guardrails up.

592
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,010
Pretty soon we're gonna
start to see audits happen

593
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,740
when it comes to AI, it's inevitable.

594
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,030
So I think one of the good things

595
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,340
about how we are thinking
about it together

596
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,900
is how can we look at how
you are leveraging AI models

597
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,150
with AWS and how can you bring

598
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,940
the enterprise lens in from ServiceNow?

599
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,820
So the whole better
together angle, I think,

600
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,710
is definitely something that you've heard

601
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,610
probably time and time
again the last several days.

602
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,020
But it's true, because I think
we bring the enterprise lens

603
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,060
to the agentic opportunity in front.

604
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,520
But I think that you
have the cloud expertise

605
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,710
that together, I think
that kind of expands

606
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,010
your horizon of what you
can do with the agents.

607
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,350
But I also think another
thing that's important to note

608
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,170
is as we're thinking about
the expansion of AI agents,

609
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,690
there still has to be humans in the loop.

610
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,770
We keep forgetting us, we
keep forgetting people.

611
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,970
So we need to figure out

612
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,850
when there's more serious decision making

613
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,320
that needs to take place,

614
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,870
maybe the agents do certain tasks,

615
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,550
but there still should
be a human in the loop

616
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,600
for the more complicated.

617
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,490
And so I think the orchestration

618
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,190
has to be across different landscape.

619
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,910
And by landscape, I mean AWS cloud,

620
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,630
we both deal with on-prem
and SaaS companies,

621
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,700
and there's a lot of different players,

622
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,400
and each one has their
own governance model.

623
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,970
So how can we help each other

624
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,680
by bringing this a amazing
end-to-end visibility

625
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,747
and transparency that's
super needed today?

626
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:27,390
And I think that's the benefit
of the AI Control Tower

627
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,490
and how we're already starting to see

628
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,960
a locking real value.

629
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,990
And I think that's something
too is let's get value

630
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,200
and not just talk about
agents doing X, Y, Z.

631
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,460
People need to see results,

632
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,530
but as you're building these solutions,

633
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,260
it should be something that governance is

634
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,110
in part of your, you know, your thinking

635
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,700
of how you're gonna advance your models

636
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,020
and your workflows.

637
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,880
We need governance, and
I think that's something

638
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,540
that is an industry sort
of push to do together,

639
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,180
but something I'm excited
that we were doing together.

640
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,640
- We've talked before
about the intersection

641
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,350
of innovation and governance.

642
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,260
Maybe provide some thoughts around that.

643
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,930
- I mean so much is
happening in the world today.

644
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,510
I mean you have NIST regulations,

645
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,020
you have DORA in Europe
with operational resiliency.

646
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,050
So many different things that
we need to take into account.

647
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,160
And I think that that expands
the difficulty, I think,

648
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,110
of what to do with agents.

649
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,460
If you give agents certain
leeway to do a task,

650
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,620
when do you take back the provision

651
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,080
to do the task, the security?

652
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,850
Do you do it when the task is done,

653
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,530
when the job is complete?

654
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,690
Like there's so many different
agents along the way,

655
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,420
it's not one agent doing the whole job.

656
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,080
You can have teams of agents
doing pieces of the job.

657
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,820
And so I think that's
the interesting thing

658
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,310
is how do you maintain
your channel checks?

659
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,990
And again, human in the loop is important,

660
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,530
but I can't emphasize enough
this idea of AI audits

661
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,120
and how we need to start thinking

662
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,630
not just of how workflows exist today.

663
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,877
We need to reimagine workflows.

664
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:02,940
And I think that's one of
the more amazing things

665
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,820
when we speak and our teams come together

666
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,400
is we start to think about let's turn

667
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,860
the current workflows on their head,

668
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,880
where can we start to reimagine
the art of the possible?

669
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,470
I mean, art of the possible is something

670
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,150
that got us all into this,

671
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,710
but what does that actually mean?

672
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,480
I think orchestrating that

673
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,820
and making sure that
we can lead by example

674
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,610
by delivering governance when it's needed,

675
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,890
but also bring value to the table.

676
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,930
I think we can't underscore enough

677
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,460
that it's not just about saying

678
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,320
the agents are doing X, Y, and Z.

679
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,670
People wanna see value.

680
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,330
- Mm-hmm, today's AI
agents are often limited

681
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,630
by scalability and coordination issues

682
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,850
due to lots of different reasons.

683
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,080
Fragmented data pipelines

684
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,930
is one of those problems
that ServiceNow is solving.

685
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,490
Maybe you can illustrate
that a little bit.

686
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,840
- I'll give an example, Courtney earlier,

687
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,520
she talked about finance,

688
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,830
and she gave in some information

689
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,230
related to the fragmentation
around finance.

690
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,660
I spent 20 years of my
career on Wall Street,

691
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,230
there is such a need for
regulation oversight,

692
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,070
and that's happening
whether you have currencies,

693
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,510
digital, stable coins,

694
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,950
a lot that's happening in the world today.

695
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,630
So with finance, especially,

696
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,310
there's a lot of fraud,

697
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,470
and I think identity management and fraud

698
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,240
also need to take place.

699
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,500
But also now, think about it

700
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,840
in the world that we're
discussing right now with agents,

701
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,640
there could be agent fraud.

702
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,250
We can't just take for face value

703
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,750
that the agent's gonna do the task

704
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,450
and that's how we need
to take it as trust.

705
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,340
So trust is something that's inherent,

706
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,510
but in the financial industry,

707
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,580
it's something that's a huge concern,

708
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,680
that you have a lot of
agents doing transactions,

709
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,620
who's governing the authority
to distribute capital?

710
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,580
That's why think it's important

711
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,570
to have the human in the loop.

712
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,790
But Wall Street is one
of the biggest areas

713
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,310
and pharma is another one
thinking about, you know,

714
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,220
personalized medicine and what
you can do to deliver that

715
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,610
and people's rights and personal data,

716
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,950
and you know, HIPAA violations.

717
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,450
So I think what you're seeing right now

718
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,390
is a look into what could we do,

719
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,068
but what can we do ethically

720
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,020
and bring responsible AI
into the agentic equation.

721
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,950
- Hmm, from that perspective,

722
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,600
and you look at the engineering
task in front of us, right,

723
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,160
there was something that
I read the other day

724
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,550
about the memory scale
that we've gotta now,

725
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,010
start looking at as well with AI.

726
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,200
Has ServiceNow looked
into that a little bit?

727
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,240
- So I think it's always
important to, first of all,

728
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,610
I have two young kids, so
memory is becoming something

729
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,500
I don't have much of these days,

730
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,630
but I think, you know what
we're trying to think of,

731
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,190
imagine a world where each
of us has hundreds of agents.

732
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,050
So I think it's great to use GenAI

733
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,180
for certain summarization capabilities

734
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,710
and do certain tasks,

735
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,190
but we have to be our own creative engine.

736
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,890
And I think that's something
I'm personally excited about

737
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,170
as we work together is I
think we bring the best

738
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,070
out of each other, AWS and ServiceNow.

739
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,310
But I think, first of all,

740
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,130
intelligence is only as
good as you can use it.

741
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,160
So it's great to have
the visibility into data,

742
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,040
but if you don't know how
to interpret the data,

743
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,570
you're at a disadvantage.

744
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,300
If you don't know how to put the data,

745
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,670
I guess at use it at the
right time in the right place,

746
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,170
you're at a disadvantage.

747
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,640
You know, I was talking
to someone the other day,

748
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,150
talking about intelligence
when it comes to finance,

749
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,460
if you had models give everybody

750
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,740
the same sort of information,

751
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,173
would the stock market just be flat?

752
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,560
And I took a moment to think about this,

753
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,470
looking back into my
earlier parts of my career

754
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,540
and think about it, there's
a lot of investment banks

755
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,120
that have had, you know,
program trading around

756
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,680
for over two decades.

757
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,270
Some hedge funds lose money,

758
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,490
some hedge funds make money.

759
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,440
It's how you interpret the data.

760
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,750
So I think when it comes
to the future of agents,

761
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,870
we have to start to bring in
contextuality into this too

762
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,420
'cause we all consume
information differently.

763
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,660
So just to say here's the blanket data,

764
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,050
we're all gonna have the same results,

765
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,120
I think is not the right frame of mind.

766
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,660
We need to think about the
contextual nature of agents,

767
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,340
and that's gonna take time.

768
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,720
But this is part of the research

769
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,750
that has to be brought forward,

770
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,597
is how do we train
agents to think like us?

771
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:12,121
And it's not so easy to say that,

772
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:13,560
you know, I think we need to figure out

773
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,750
what we really want the agents to do,

774
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,020
and they might know certain
pieces of information,

775
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,420
and I think this is where
we're gonna see an evolution.

776
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,248
We don't need to give that
agent everything about us,

777
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,860
or in every part of
the business ecosystem,

778
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,470
they need to do one thing
and one thing right,

779
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,110
repetitively and at scale.

780
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,180
And I think that's where
you're gonna start to see,

781
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,450
you know, specialist the way
we have in our own human jobs.

782
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,160
We have specialists who
do different things.

783
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,993
Agents are gonna become specialists,

784
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,760
and I think so intelligence

785
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,080
only as good as you can use it,

786
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,870
and I look forward to seeing
how we evolve that together.

787
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,090
- So smarter resource allocation-

788
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,620
- Sure.
- Right?

789
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,540
Many enterprises are still guessing

790
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,100
how many agents or humans

791
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,170
to allocate towards a project.

792
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,870
From your standpoint, sorry,
that was my ringer too,

793
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,000
so I'm like, "Wait, what?"

794
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,460
How are AWS and ServiceNow
working together

795
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,358
to bring data-driven
benchmarking to agents

796
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:10,740
and human resource planning?

797
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,500
What does that mean for
productivity and budget?

798
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,577
- I think it's a marvel
when you start to think

799
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:22,577
about how many agents do you
actually need to do a job.

800
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,090
I think it's a complicated question

801
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,390
when we refer to agents,
it's taken for granted,

802
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,760
is it seven agents, is it 20 agents,

803
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,340
is it three humans, is it five humans?

804
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,020
So I think right now
it's been a guessing game

805
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,710
and that's hurt people who
have allocated money towards AI

806
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,690
seeking faster returns

807
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,490
because they actually are not allocating

808
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,660
the proper amount, and what
the beauty of our relationship

809
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,150
is to explore what could that look like.

810
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,910
And so it's exciting to know
that we're both committed

811
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,590
to exploring that together.

812
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,320
Because I think if we have
the benchmarking put in place,

813
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,950
it can allow you as
developers and engineers

814
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,110
the ability to make better decisions

815
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,160
with prototyping too

816
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,050
and see what works and what doesn't.

817
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,670
And right now, that's a guessing game,

818
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,030
and we all know that we have
to show tangible results.

819
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,830
So I think benchmarking

820
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,560
is something that I look
forward to in the new year,

821
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,630
which is not that far away,

822
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,340
both of us coming forward together

823
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,620
with academic partnerships

824
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,660
because I think that we
need to ground everything

825
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,790
that we're discussing in research.

826
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,880
And one of the beauties
of our relationship

827
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,180
is we don't go for the hype headline.

828
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,820
And I do think that the
industry has been hurt

829
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,620
by a lot of headlines.

830
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,912
And for us, I think,

831
00:34:35,912 --> 00:34:38,460
as ServiceNow and AWS have come together,

832
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,300
we're trying to figure out

833
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,520
how can we actually
support what we're saying.

834
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,490
So I like the methodical
approach of taking research

835
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,680
and turning research into validity,

836
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,560
and validity into action that
we both could benefit from.

837
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,240
So that's been a wonderful thing.

838
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,920
So they say, "What happens
in Vegas stays in Vegas."

839
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm happy that that goes beyond the world

840
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,750
because we're doing some
bright things together.

841
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,040
- Well, it's a great segue.

842
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,838
We are working together
towards a academic partnership,

843
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,190
ServiceNow, AWS, and a
well-known institution

844
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,200
to experiment more with technology

845
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,970
so that we've got some benchmarking.

846
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,410
Maybe walk the audience through

847
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,060
why we're doing this together

848
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,010
and what the outcome
we're expecting to get.

849
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,570
- Yeah, I mean this is the fun part

850
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,817
of the conversation for me-
- Yeah, this is, yeah.

851
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:24,600
- So I think it's interesting

852
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,600
because AI is fantastic,
it also has limitations.

853
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,710
And so as we are thinking about

854
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,660
how do we help you
become more future-ready

855
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,660
as you are delivering
solutions to your customers

856
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,400
and in your businesses,

857
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,470
we are looking actively at the role

858
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,960
of quantum computing plus AI.

859
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,560
So quantum plus AI and the role of agents.

860
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,320
There's a lot of
opportunities that we foresee

861
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,320
that the agent ecosystem
is only beginning.

862
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,070
There's a lot to happen,

863
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,720
and again, teams of agents

864
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,490
operating in different landscapes,

865
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,220
again across SaaS companies,

866
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,520
on-prem businesses, as
well as in the cloud,

867
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,730
and we need to figure out how
we can manage this better,

868
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,310
how we can attack more difficult problems.

869
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,670
So quantum will absolutely
not be used for everything,

870
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,200
but we do believe there is a future

871
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,830
where certain business
cases make sense to explore.

872
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,900
And the endeavor that we have with AWS

873
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,730
is to look at the use cases,

874
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,080
see what makes the most sense,

875
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,330
again grounded in research and validity,

876
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,500
but bring it forward in a way

877
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,800
that we are confident
that it can help people.

878
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,020
And I think that goes
back to our mutual roots

879
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,100
of helping people and putting
AI to work for people.

880
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,440
So quantum plus AI, it's exciting,

881
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,760
look at the role of simulation,

882
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,580
what we might be able to do
in natural disaster relief

883
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,230
or in the financial space.

884
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,720
But beyond, look at personalized medicine,

885
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,100
things that we might be able to look at,

886
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,990
individuals versus the mass.

887
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,050
And so we feel even with
supply chain and logistics,

888
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,300
I mean, who would've
thought a few years ago

889
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,760
there would've been a vessel
stuck in the Suez Canal

890
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,040
and it crippled global
trade for many days.

891
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,500
We need to start anticipating more

892
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,400
and having that modeling
more advanced digital twins.

893
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,960
So we do feel like there's a component

894
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,110
that needs to be looked at
for better decision making,

895
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,750
and we hope that that that enterprise lens

896
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,780
with a quantum plus AI story is beneficial

897
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,960
to those using AWS as well as ServiceNow.

898
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,760
- So on that quantum computing track,

899
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,220
how do you see quantum computing

900
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,000
shaping industry moving
forward, our industries?

901
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,590
- Yeah, I mean I think,
well, first of all,

902
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,750
I mean look at, and if you're based here

903
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,583
in the United States,

904
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,330
there's mandates out of the White House,

905
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,850
there's new regulations out of NIST.

906
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,190
Financial companies will
have to be reporting more

907
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,360
on quantum readiness.

908
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,550
Companies that we've been speaking to

909
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,010
have already said that the way
people report on Wall Street

910
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,900
for sustainability initiatives

911
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,450
may soon have to report quantum readiness.

912
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,970
And we are excited that we published,

913
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,860
not too long ago, several months ago,

914
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,793
the first quantum readiness
story from ServiceNow.

915
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,060
And we are excited because
it's grounded in something

916
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,820
that is near term, the
ServiceNow Vault team

917
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,390
in Q1 of next year,
post-quantum cryptography.

918
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,400
PQC is classical base, but nevertheless,

919
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,230
it's a journey, we have to start there.

920
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,110
So I think how it shapes is forcing people

921
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,810
to think about industry is different,

922
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,320
but also again, elevating
the governance piece.

923
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,060
What can we do to help people,

924
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,610
help companies safeguard data?

925
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,750
'Cause right now there is

926
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,040
the harvest now, decrypt later phenomenon

927
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,290
that impacts all businesses.

928
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,050
So what can we do to start
thinking about that more rapidly?

929
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,600
And so I think moving from PQC

930
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,490
and advancing it into ways

931
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,530
that could become global standards,

932
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,090
you know, I think that's where, you know,

933
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,160
us getting involved together
in the public sector

934
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
and as well in the industry,

935
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,100
I just think it's an amazing opportunity

936
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:55,100
to think about what the
global world could look like

937
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,680
in this new paradigm that I think is,

938
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,410
again, looking at agentic
AI is still very new.

939
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,970
- Mm-hmm!
- And we need governance.

940
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,620
I can't say that enough to all of you

941
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,420
as you're building your solutions,

942
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,150
we need to figure out how
a way to bring truth in.

943
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,970
'Cause right now there's
a lot of hallucinations

944
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,560
that need to be revisited too.

945
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,650
So, you know, the role of
quantum would be something

946
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,100
that we think as an accelerator to AI.

947
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,677
I had said earlier, quantum plus AI,

948
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:23,340
'cause it is an accelerator.

949
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,350
AI is great, but it could do better,

950
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,820
and we think quantum

951
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,860
could be a really good remedy for that.

952
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,740
- So how do we get our workforce ready

953
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,170
for that combination, for AI plus quantum?

954
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,910
- Well, first, I think enablement is key.

955
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,890
I mean, I think, you
know, in many businesses,

956
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,780
I think it's important to
put together AI enablement.

957
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,250
But I think as we have in ServiceNow,

958
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,870
we actually are dedicating time

959
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,883
for quantum enablement in 2026.

960
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:50,880
I think it's important to do both.

961
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,387
You know, not everyone's
is a quantum physicist

962
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:57,210
or they're trained in classical AI

963
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,730
and it's hard to bring those people out.

964
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,970
But there's such an appetite
we're finding internally

965
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,430
for engineers that we have in AI

966
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,410
to venture into the quantum side.

967
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,920
And so there are courses, certifications,

968
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,300
things that we've even discussed,

969
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,910
maybe even doing some
certifications together.

970
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,620
But this is a journey,
this is not something

971
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,047
that you're gonna do this by January 15th

972
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,520
and you're gonna have the answer.

973
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,130
It is a journey, but
we feel very confident

974
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,830
that it's the right path to go on.

975
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:29,250
- If you could give one piece of advice

976
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,644
to the builders in the audience,

977
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:34,980
how can they start engaging

978
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,120
with ServiceNow and AWS on co-innovation?

979
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,440
- Yeah, well, good question.

980
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,683
So I'm part of the future
team for ServiceNow.

981
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,200
And I think it's important to...

982
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,900
You know, it has to be bidirectional.

983
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,187
It can't be us coming
always to you and saying,

984
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,430
"Hey, we have a solution."

985
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,020
We wanna know what the problem is.

986
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,100
We already hear from you

987
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,750
to say this has been a pain point.

988
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,800
Hearing from customers,

989
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,020
so jointly hearing from customers

990
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,490
to say how we might be able to help you

991
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,110
is definitely paramount.

992
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,730
I think that we need to understand

993
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,867
is what can we do from
a pilot perspective.

994
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:10,350
You know, you have to ask leadership,

995
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,420
is it okay to have a window of time?

996
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,190
'Cause I think we need time,

997
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,820
whether we dedicate
three months to attacking

998
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,470
a specific problem or a
year in a research study.

999
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,580
I think that's important.

1000
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,530
Again, we need to ground in validity.

1001
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,870
So I think where we can start to see this

1002
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,050
is pick up a phone and
email to you and me,

1003
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,940
and see like where are you finding

1004
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,850
that there's an opportunity
to leverage innovation.

1005
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,220
And I think we have innovation forums,

1006
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,170
we invite people to EBCs

1007
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,050
where we focus on innovation workshops

1008
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,780
and kind of get to, you know,
the crux of the problem.

1009
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,180
Sometimes people come in with one problem

1010
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,790
and they realize in the
grand scheme of things

1011
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,620
it was very short-term.

1012
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,250
So if we're talking about
being in a world of horizons,

1013
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,350
we need to start thinking about,

1014
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,090
you know, short, medium, and long term.

1015
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,080
But horizon three is not
five years away anymore.

1016
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,870
The speed of innovation
has happened so fast

1017
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,070
that we need to figure out a way

1018
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,240
to accelerate innovation.

1019
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,020
So that patience is getting shorter,

1020
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,610
and I think we have to
deliver the results.

1021
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,300
So jointly, one thing
that you said earlier,

1022
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,600
just to say about, you know,
back to the enablement,

1023
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,120
you need to get support from leadership,

1024
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,610
you need to have a cross org committee

1025
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:28,140
focused on innovation,
focused on quantum plus AI,

1026
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,580
focused on AI.

1027
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,020
I think a lot of people
work on projects and silos,

1028
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,060
and I think that one of the beauties

1029
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,120
of how we can work together
is help break the silos.

1030
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,120
So we do that first internally cross org

1031
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,610
and then cross company,
like we've been doing.

1032
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,760
I think it's been successful
as we started exploring

1033
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,860
possibilities with the
role of quantum plus AI,

1034
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,110
we pushed each other behind closed doors.

1035
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,450
And I think that that's my ask of you,

1036
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,760
it's you need the cross team alignment.

1037
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,660
'Cause we often find that

1038
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,080
that's such a hindrance for innovation.

1039
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,880
And also the next earnings report

1040
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,460
shouldn't be the reason why
you move innovation forward.

1041
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,990
We need to think more of more
agility but also longevity.

1042
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,430
- Mm-hmm, thank you.

1043
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,310
We have a few minutes for some
questions from the audience

1044
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,383
if anybody has a question for John.

1045
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,733
Anyone?

1046
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,853
- I can't even see,

1047
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:25,290
it's like...
- Yeah, it is very bright.

1048
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,480
All right, well, I'll ask you one.

1049
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,340
So one of the things
that we've talked about

1050
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,720
in this whole quantum world

1051
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,580
is kind of like where to start, right?

1052
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,560
So I think a lot of organizations

1053
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,760
had that same thing with AI,

1054
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,593
where do you start?

1055
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:38,940
And we have joint customers

1056
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,130
that are still trying to figure that out.

1057
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,400
So as organizations are looking
at where to start with AI

1058
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,050
and starting their journey,

1059
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,580
how do they start looking at quantum

1060
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,480
and starting that journey?

1061
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,650
- I think you have to see

1062
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,070
where you're already facing
pain points in your business

1063
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,130
and seeing where you're already
having difficulty with AI.

1064
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,250
Some of the more complex computations

1065
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,800
will require an opportunity
to look at quantum.

1066
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,180
But I think that having the ability

1067
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,970
to recognize what's already
working and what's not

1068
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,605
is really important as step one..

1069
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,930
I think it's important

1070
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,330
to think about putting quantum to work.

1071
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,860
I think there was a slide earlier

1072
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,430
that Courtney had up of AI
plus data plus workflows,

1073
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,440
and you have to understand
that is there an opportunity

1074
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,130
for AI plus data plus
quantum AI workflows.

1075
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,050
So a lot of it is to test and try,

1076
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,090
but I think you have to
start by understanding

1077
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,950
what is your current environment

1078
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,840
and where are you seeing gaps.

1079
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,986
And like I said earlier,

1080
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:35,160
quantum will not solve everything,

1081
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,630
but we are leading with AI

1082
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,640
and trying to fill gaps with quantum,

1083
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,020
and that's the way I think you need

1084
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,630
to look into your own
organization to fill the gaps.

1085
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,830
- Hmm, agreed.

1086
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,650
So at AWS, we're seeing organizations,

1087
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,060
a lot of healthcare
organizations using quantum

1088
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,890
just because of the
computational, you know, nature.

1089
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,020
How do you see, I know you
talked about the workforce

1090
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,550
a little bit earlier today,

1091
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,730
but what types of people
now do we need to employ

1092
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,830
to start thinking about the problems

1093
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,450
we don't even know we have yet?

1094
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,660
- Look, I have a eight-year-old
son who's coding right now.

1095
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,100
I used to go outside and go play soccer,

1096
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,410
he's building Minecraft
and all these things.

1097
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,160
The next generation is coming
up very different than us.

1098
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,740
Kids today are already using AI in school.

1099
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,860
I think data science is really important.

1100
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,510
I think learning different,

1101
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,950
playing around with different models

1102
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,960
is also very important.

1103
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,230
ChatGPT is not an AI strategy.

1104
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,270
And so I think what we need to use

1105
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,670
all the different availability

1106
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,500
of models that are out there,

1107
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,600
and I think exposing kids to this,

1108
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,160
I think is really important.

1109
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,500
But as the kids become the next leaders,

1110
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,970
we ourselves need to figure out

1111
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,770
what do we want to do with this.

1112
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,670
So I think, you know,

1113
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,680
there's a lot of academic institutions

1114
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,280
that offer free certifications
around quantum computing,

1115
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,053
I think that's also very important.

1116
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,660
You and I have had the opportunity

1117
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,720
to speak at a couple of
academic institutions,

1118
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,190
and there is a willingness
to open up different paths

1119
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,880
with like leveraging students in college

1120
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,320
and bring them into your company.

1121
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,210
So I think that's a new avenue,

1122
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,860
internships of course.

1123
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,050
But I think that there's
just an opportunity right now

1124
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,472
to look into math, because, you know,

1125
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:18,000
there will be limitations.

1126
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,100
You're talking about zeros and ones

1127
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,260
and you're talking about nature.

1128
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,460
So it's quite different.

1129
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,960
So I just think that we need...

1130
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,860
I feel like people say you need
to study this and just this,

1131
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,720
and I feel like you
should study everything

1132
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,820
'cause you learn one model

1133
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,830
and next week a new one comes out.

1134
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,390
It's so hard, it's like, you know,

1135
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,490
Charlie Brown when he kicks the football

1136
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,260
and Lucy moves the goalpost.

1137
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,150
That's how AI is today.

1138
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,100
Like we're just we're
getting too comfortable

1139
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,340
putting one set of strategies in place.

1140
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,870
So I think with quantum too,

1141
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,040
so with both parallel,

1142
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,830
I think it's an interesting
dynamic to continue to learn,

1143
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,230
but also to test things.

1144
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,310
And I think to that is, you know,

1145
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,160
engineering is gonna have
a very bright future,

1146
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,350
you know, for decades to come.

1147
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,970
- You touched on it just a second ago,

1148
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,970
but model choice is confusing, fantastic,

1149
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,710
difficult to navigate, a
lot of different things.

1150
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,170
What's ServiceNow's
approach to model choice?

1151
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,300
- So we are agnostic,

1152
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,310
and similar approach to how...

1153
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,620
So AI is very agnostic in that,

1154
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,820
and I think that's one of the beauties

1155
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,800
of how we work together
because quite honestly,

1156
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,760
so are you.

1157
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,020
But I think it's for us

1158
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,880
is to try to figure out the orchestration

1159
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,120
that's needed still in being agnostic.

1160
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,880
But I think that there's, you know,

1161
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,330
different models today have
also governance issues.

1162
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,100
Like there's European models

1163
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,620
that have quite different
information as they do here.

1164
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,690
And if you actually try to solve a problem

1165
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,870
and you gave the same problem
to five different models,

1166
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,540
you would be surprised
at what you get back,

1167
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,480
and how maybe how different
the answers actually are.

1168
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,810
So don't take what the
models give as face value

1169
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,980
and make a business decision

1170
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,240
on just what the model inputs.

1171
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,700
But I think that one of the things

1172
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,680
that you can do is start benchmarking,

1173
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,090
and benchmarking the success

1174
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:06,000
and also benchmarking who's using what.

1175
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,170
And I think that's one of the reasons

1176
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,440
why the AI Control Tower from
ServiceNow is very valuable

1177
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,890
because it gives that window
into who's using the models,

1178
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,990
and what's the benefit of the models.

1179
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,510
And you could start, so
I think parsing the data,

1180
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,790
and it goes back to
understanding the data,

1181
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,490
but models are super interesting.

1182
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,950
Certain models are good
for certain things,

1183
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,210
and I think that's one of the things,

1184
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,880
the enablement piece, has
to help people understand,

1185
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,680
is that good for you?

1186
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,300
And it might not be.

1187
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,250
- Which poses some very
interesting questions

1188
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,780
when you look at an organization

1189
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,910
and how they're going to
start implementing AI,

1190
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,370
and who's in charge of choosing models.

1191
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,930
I don't know if you have looked

1192
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,840
into how that governance piece is.

1193
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,850
It's a slightly different problem.

1194
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,890
- I don't think that we haven't been told

1195
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,720
like do this, not that.

1196
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,970
I think there has been
a definite gravitation

1197
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,540
towards trying new things
and bringing them forward.

1198
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,880
And if you have a case
for trying something new

1199
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,200
that we don't have access to,

1200
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,530
I think it's something
that the executive team

1201
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:06,420
is very receptive to that.

1202
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,300
But I think, you know, make
the business case for models,

1203
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,950
I think is very important too.

1204
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,683
People use models, and
to your point earlier,

1205
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,700
they just assume it's the right model.

1206
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,770
Now we're talking about
how we came together

1207
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,170
is the enterprise and the cloud..

1208
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,140
Enterprise models, some
models are better than others,

1209
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,840
and some models, you may
just get the job done.

1210
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,150
And I think some of
that's trial and error.

1211
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,320
I mean, I was just saying this

1212
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,460
'cause I know one of my developers

1213
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,293
is in the audience right now.

1214
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:34,770
I mean I use Claude

1215
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,480
and I've been using prototyping

1216
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,570
just as a tool for myself to prove ideas.

1217
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,650
It's quite valuable,

1218
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,090
it's kind of interesting to see that.

1219
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,430
So it's nice that we
actually now have Claude

1220
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:45,937
inside of ServiceNow.

1221
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:47,610
So I think sometimes when you make a case

1222
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,830
for certain models being beneficial,

1223
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,050
I think you'll have good access to them.

1224
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,839
- I think one of the things that AWS

1225
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,680
that we are trying to
help guide customers on

1226
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,590
is how to budget around AI

1227
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,273
'cause it's a new territory.

1228
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,270
Can you talk a little bit
about when you're looking

1229
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,200
at sort of this overall AI
strategy for an organization

1230
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,640
and looking at the workflows

1231
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,360
that would require the
most attention first,

1232
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,280
and that's very subjective obviously,

1233
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,680
how should organizations
look at, you know,

1234
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,670
the right model versus
cost versus governance?

1235
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,320
- Yeah, I mean, well, look,

1236
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,560
cost is definitely gonna
be high on the equation.

1237
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,430
But as I said earlier,

1238
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:30,030
certain models are different

1239
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,980
for the enterprise than they are for,

1240
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,050
you know, normal use.

1241
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,910
Nevertheless, I think
how you're gonna do it

1242
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:39,150
is tie the models to strategy.

1243
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,260
And I think that's another thing

1244
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,260
that's been missing too,
is people been using AI

1245
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,900
but actually not tying
it to corporate strategy.

1246
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,730
And I think as people start to bring

1247
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,950
AI and strategy closer together,

1248
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,420
I think you're gonna find results.

1249
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,030
And it's interesting 'cause at ServiceNow,

1250
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,130
we have our CFO,

1251
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,770
the corporate strategy team
actually reports to her.

1252
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,000
So think about this for a second.

1253
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,260
So spending into AI, financial results,

1254
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,170
strategic initiatives,
they're tied together.

1255
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,450
And I think you're gonna see more of that,

1256
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:13,530
and by that I mean bringing
AI closer to strategy.

1257
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,050
'Cause I think that we
need to start proving this,

1258
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,940
'cause it shouldn't be a blank check.

1259
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,650
And I think that's been the approach

1260
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,650
for the last two years is we
had the OpenAI ChatGPT moment

1261
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,090
and people just started writing a check

1262
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:31,050
just because they wanted
AI in their brochure.

1263
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,880
But nevertheless, I think putting it

1264
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,380
when we have tangible results

1265
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,580
that you can actually
support customer validations,

1266
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,890
like we had DXC well here earlier.

1267
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,690
I think having customers actually saying

1268
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:45,330
that we've tried it and it worked,

1269
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,180
you'll get the bigger budget for AI.

1270
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,190
But I think we need more proof,

1271
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,020
and I think that's gonna take time.

1272
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,150
But I like the notion of bringing AI

1273
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,600
and strategy closer
together because ultimately,

1274
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,150
I think the benefit is super high,

1275
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,320
and I think that's one of the reasons

1276
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,530
why strategically we've come together

1277
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,840
because we know that
there's a bigger story here,

1278
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,790
but we've aligned strategy
with the spending,

1279
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,340
and I think that's maybe a lesson

1280
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,020
to think about after this.

1281
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,050
- Yeah, we've seen a
number of organizations

1282
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,760
report increased cost savings

1283
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,393
by using AI even though there is

1284
00:52:19,393 --> 00:52:22,620
a different spend calculation
that goes along with it.

1285
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,733
And I would say, you know, at AWS,

1286
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:27,150
a number of the organizations
that we've worked with

1287
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,740
first and foremost sort
of early on in all of this

1288
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,420
tackled really big use cases early on.

1289
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,378
And I think we've talked a lot about,

1290
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:37,890
"Err, don't do that, start smaller,

1291
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,180
and kind of work your way up."

1292
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,740
What's your advice for organizations?

1293
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,730
- I think you've heard me

1294
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,890
actually say this expression before,

1295
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,450
but if there's any baseball
fans in the audience,

1296
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,830
if you hit a single every day,

1297
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,720
you get into the Hall of Fame,

1298
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,090
you do not need to hit a home run.

1299
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,610
And I think that's been,
I think, a misconception

1300
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,960
about how to use AI, is you
need to show grand results

1301
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,030
Hit the base hit, show the results,

1302
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,410
build upon those results,

1303
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,330
and I think you'll have a lot more

1304
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:09,033
of strategic outcomes
that you can be proud of.

1305
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,780
- In sort of last question for you,

1306
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,120
what's the downside to all of this?

1307
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,410
Like what advice would you give?

1308
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,570
Like what's to watch? (mumbles)

1309
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,470
Sorry, what to watch out for?

1310
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:22,830
- I mean I think I alluded to it earlier

1311
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,470
is I think sometimes we use these models

1312
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:30,420
and we take them as credible
answers, credible advice.

1313
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,610
And I think that we still
need the human in the loop,

1314
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:36,660
and I think we need to
model future workflows

1315
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,760
with more human involvement.

1316
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,380
And I think that that's something

1317
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,710
that is gonna take a lot
of rolling up our sleeves

1318
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:44,760
to figure out the place.

1319
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,030
'Cause it's not just
how work is done today.

1320
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,460
And earlier I mentioned
like re-imagining work,

1321
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,840
and I think that's something

1322
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,870
that I would love to think about more.

1323
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:56,250
We bring out the best of each other

1324
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,480
'cause behind closed doors,

1325
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,670
we are pushing the problem set.

1326
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,690
And I think that's something

1327
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,160
that I think people should start to do

1328
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,530
is what is the compliance,

1329
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:07,740
what's the topic of this
panel of governance?

1330
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,910
Like that's gonna be part

1331
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,040
of like what is going
to be pulled through.

1332
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,660
So, I mean, I think, you know,

1333
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,760
if you can meet the upcoming regulations,

1334
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,720
like don't look just past one
quarter or second quarter,

1335
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,800
there's a lot humming.

1336
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,250
The fact that quantum is
part of a conversation

1337
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,507
with AWS and ServiceNow,

1338
00:54:24,507 --> 00:54:27,180
you can see that we're
taking this super seriously.

1339
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,100
So I think as you're
planning for what comes next,

1340
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,390
don't forget to where we are,

1341
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:35,340
and responsible AI is built on trust.

1342
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,300
And that's one of the
hallmarks of our relationship.

1343
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,910
- Yeah, and I think getting
people used to using it

1344
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,750
in the first place, right, too.

1345
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,550
- Trial and error.
- Yeah, trial and error.

1346
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,110
John, thank you so much
for your time today.

1347
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,030
Thank you all for joining us today.

1348
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,070
Thank you for being at "AWS re:Invent".

1349
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,821
Hope you have a wonderful week.

1350
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,382
(audience applauding)
