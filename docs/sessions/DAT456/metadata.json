  "title_cn": "AWS re:Invent 2025 - 揭秘北极光：Amazon Aurora 安全深度剖析 (DAT456)",
  "abstract": "Researchers at the DEF CON 33 security conference shared that Amazon RDS successfully defended against their novel attack, despite the underlying open source database engine not releasing patches at the time. This is the result of years of consistent investment in security and isolation, enabling customers to focus on their applications instead of managing databases. We dive deep into the engineering and layered security architecture for Amazon Aurora, examining how multiple complementary layers including encryption, network controls, granular permissions, AWS IAM, active defense, and Amazon GuardDuty work together to protect customers' data from the infrastructure through the application interface.",
  "abstract_cn": "在 DEF CON 33 安全会议上，研究人员分享了 Amazon RDS 成功防御了他们的新型攻击，尽管底层开源数据库引擎当时尚未发布补丁。这是多年来持续投资于安全性和隔离性的结果，使客户能够专注于应用程序而非管理数据库。我们深入探讨了 Amazon Aurora 的工程和分层安全架构，研究了包括加密、网络控制、细粒度权限、AWS IAM、主动防御和 Amazon GuardDuty 在内的多个互补层如何协同工作，从基础设施到应用程序接口全方位保护客户数据。",
