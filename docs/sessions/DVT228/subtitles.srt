1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,788
We're going to be talking about

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,530
Kiro powers. So I'm doing the He-Man

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,070
power

4
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:07,408
move so similar for you. How many of you,

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,069
quick, quick show of your hands, how many people here have used

6
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:12,419
hero? All

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,060
right, cool, um,

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:14,978
handful.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,829
How many people have heard of Quiro?

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,769
Yeah, I think we did our job, uh, when I, I,

11
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,228
I had a session day one

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,789
and I asked the audience and it was like 30%

13
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,969
and like by day 4 now it's, uh,

14
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,978
everyone knows about Kiro,

15
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:30,449
so we're hoping that, you know, we, a lot more

16
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,870
of you try Quiro over

17
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,819
like once you get back to,

18
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,548
uh, over the holidays actually

19
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:38,209
and hope all of you took advantage of the 1000

20
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:39,469
free credits you can get

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,598
at the

22
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,109
uh Kiro haunted house

23
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,810
back at the Venetian.

24
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,529
So today we're going to talk about powers. This is a feature

25
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,310
that we launched just yesterday morning.

26
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,259
I will get into what it is and and what

27
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,340
problem it solves, but here's the rough agenda. We'll

28
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,039
start with

29
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,618
the general problem that we were trying to solve

30
00:00:58,618 --> 00:00:59,439
with powers.

31
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,340
How we're going about solving it.

32
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,558
And then I will,

33
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,939
I'll do a live demo, so hopefully the demo gods

34
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,028
are with me. Uh,

35
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,269
and, oh, I, I totally forgot. I forgot to introduce,

36
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,549
uh, we, we have two partners here. I have

37
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,888
Harry Mauer, who's the CTO of Postman,

38
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,689
and then, uh, Tyler Schuckert,

39
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,629
who's a Devre engineer at Superbase,

40
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,400
and they're gonna talk about,

41
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:25,709
uh, their use cases about how they're using

42
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,709
powers to really streamline the

43
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:28,888
onboarding for,

44
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,510
uh, API development and backend

45
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,599
development. Now

46
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,939
I'm sure you've seen a variant of the slide

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,049
over the last 4 days over 1000 times.

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,159
Uh, AI has transformed software dev. Uh,

49
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,278
what started with inline code

50
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:47,299
suggestions that would give you a function

51
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:50,000
has now evolved to full blown agents

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,819
that are able to.

53
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,349
Build large features in your code base.

54
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,329
But one of the problems is that AI

55
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,278
agents are still generalists.

56
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:03,058
Jack of all trades, if you will.

57
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,719
So every time you go to do something specific

58
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,719
like you're, you're working on a front end

59
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,490
or you're working on an API

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,830
or a back end,

61
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,508
there's a lot of massaging you have to do with the,

62
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:14,240
with the agent,

63
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,258
providing the agent a lot of context.

64
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,469
To get the right outcome you want.

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,979
For specialized tasks, agents do

66
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,058
face challenges. The first one really.

67
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,179
Is that

68
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:33,538
Software is evolving every day. Every day

69
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:34,338
there's a new SDK.

70
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,979
Every day there's like a new, new tool

71
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,278
or technology that's launched.

72
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,139
The models that power the agents are often

73
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,080
trained on data that isn't

74
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,099
up to date.

75
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:45,490
So,

76
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,008
if you want to work with an SDK like the strands

77
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:50,008
TypeScript SDK for agent development came

78
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:51,088
out at reinvent.

79
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,758
You're gonna have to figure out how to get the model to,

80
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,439
or the agent to build strand

81
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,550
stuff. You could link it to the docks,

82
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,360
but it's just gonna go ahead and

83
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,558
Decide what it wants to do.

84
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,080
And the second problem is that even when the agent

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,778
does,

86
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,240
uh, know about or even when the agent does

87
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,319
know about a particular piece of technology or a

88
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:11,939
framework.

89
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,429
It can miss steps and it can, it can

90
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,139
not follow, it doesn't really have an onboarding manual

91
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:20,580
for that, uh,

92
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,028
for that for a technology.

93
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,580
MCP was built to solve that problem. How many

94
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,899
of you are familiar with MCP?

95
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,118
OK, so MCP is a model context

96
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:35,240
provider. It was a, it's a, it's a convention that

97
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,860
was built

98
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,159
so that you could share, so it allowed for

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,189
agents an extensible model when working

100
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:40,969
with agents.

101
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,639
So for example, both our partners here today, Postman

102
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,439
and Superbase, have MCP servers.

103
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,159
The MCP servers really talk to their APIs,

104
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,139
so they're able to do things like list projects,

105
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,219
update tables, create collections.

106
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,349
Um,

107
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,729
but the MCP alone, um, is

108
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:56,349
also

109
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,088
not enough. The, the problem that happens

110
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,479
with agents is as you add more and more agent

111
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,610
MCPs to your agent.

112
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,649
The agent gets overwhelmed with con with

113
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:06,349
context.

114
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,659
And a real problem that's emerged in the industry as a

115
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,819
whole is context rot that as more tools

116
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,899
get added and and are made

117
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:14,838
available to the agent.

118
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,119
Performance degrades, so and quality output

119
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:18,660
declines.

120
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,790
Additionally, with the even with the MCP

121
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,569
server in hand.

122
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,048
There's often guidance and onboarding instructions

123
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,088
that are completely missed that the agent

124
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:30,269
just does not follow.

125
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,309
So what you often need to pair is almost a combination

126
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,170
of MCP.

127
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:35,778
And context

128
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,019
Now a lot of solutions have popped up even

129
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,149
beyond MCP in the market now. You have,

130
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,470
uh, cloud Skills, you know, they recently launched

131
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,988
anthropically recently launched,

132
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,399
it's called Tool Search Tool, kind of a weird name,

133
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:52,238
um, that, that allows you to like dynamically

134
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,459
discover tools.

135
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:55,850
Uh, you have cursor rules, you have agents.

136
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,199
MD, but they're sub-agents.

137
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,269
But they're all different ways

138
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:01,069
to

139
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,829
get to the same thing and

140
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,290
just if you go look online in the

141
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,470
forums and on Reddit,

142
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,040
people are very confused, like, what do I use,

143
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,548
when do I use, what,

144
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,329
like, and there's a, there are tons of

145
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:15,629
YouTube videos about

146
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,778
MCP versus skills versus sub-agents,

147
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,230
and they all kind of do

148
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,649
the, the, the end goal is really you want

149
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,149
to generate code

150
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:27,009
for your to match your intent.

151
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,959
And so we really took a step back with

152
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,858
with powers and we

153
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:34,608
thought about how do we one.

154
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:37,528
Get the agent to learn

155
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,290
something specialized.

156
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,759
And 2,

157
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,319
do it in a way where it doesn't actually

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,420
overwhelm the agent with context.

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,579
And that's kind of why we launched Hero Powers.

160
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,699
So what hero powers do

161
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,119
is that they give they're a

162
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,699
bundle that is a that give the agent

163
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,920
extensible specialized capabilities,

164
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,838
right? So it really makes your hero agent extensible

165
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:04,959
so you can add a power,

166
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,879
uh, and then the agent knows about that power.

167
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,108
And when you, you do it, you take on a task

168
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,790
that is related to the power,

169
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,569
the agent can just automatically discover it.

170
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,869
The unique thing here is that as you

171
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:20,528
add these powers.

172
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:22,899
They're not just, ah,

173
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,439
they're not going to overwhelm your agent with context,

174
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,129
because the agent is getting very minimal

175
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,819
information. About

176
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:31,338
the specific

177
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,778
technology. So in this case if we add Postman

178
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:35,519
and Figma

179
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,528
sorry, Postman and Superbase,

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,079
the agent just knows about that that it

181
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,220
has these postman capabilities available

182
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,858
and if you ask questions about APIs,

183
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,959
it'll automatically just say hey I need to use the

184
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,819
Postman power

185
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:50,778
and they'll actually start going ahead and um

186
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,399
following the instructions in the power.

187
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,410
What the power really contains, and I'll show this in the demo,

188
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,238
is a combination of it has,

189
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,588
it's a front matter, it's got front matter and markdown,

190
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,189
so there's a power. MD file

191
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,809
that defines basically onboarding instructions

192
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:06,769
and a workflow

193
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,278
for the agent to follow, and that's

194
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:10,928
the that's the only required

195
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,108
piece of information.

196
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,000
But what you can also do is, is combine that

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,459
with MCP tools to really make it powerful.

198
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,600
So power is the is the only available

199
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,619
solution out there right now that combines

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,459
steering and MCP

201
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,858
in one bucket

202
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,439
and what we do is we have a we

203
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,439
have a template really for the Power

204
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,019
MD

205
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,858
that allows you to do things on install

206
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,459
uh and on activation.

207
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,079
Allow you to install hooks

208
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,738
and ah steering files, which we'll,

209
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,178
I'll I'll kind of show you in the demo.

210
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:48,088
We've partnered with um

211
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,600
partners, so we've got a curated set of partners.

212
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,838
Yeah, we've, we've, uh, partnered with partners across

213
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,778
the life cycle of application development.

214
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,338
So from UI development with Figma

215
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,699
to API development with Postman

216
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,660
to backend development with Superbase and Neon

217
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,559
to payments with Stripe.

218
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,088
And

219
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,678
It's not just curated powers we've built it in

220
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,738
a way so anyone can build a power.

221
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,540
So in fact, in my demo what I'm gonna

222
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,670
do today is start with one of the curate powers and then

223
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,178
actually like live build a power

224
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,500
and and bring it into my project.

225
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,488
What that allows is really the community to build

226
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:28,509
a whole variety of powers. Just yesterday

227
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,028
at my last session I had 3,

228
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,700
individuals come up to me and say, Hey,

229
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,928
I've got this really cool use case for a power.

230
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:36,908
They, they were

231
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:38,609
doing Java upgrades and

232
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,950
apparently that's really hard. I'm not a Java developer,

233
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,849
um, and.

234
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:44,347
Uh,

235
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,609
we already have, there's like multiple

236
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,729
repos. Someone created a Kiro Powers repo

237
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,668
overnight,

238
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,418
and they've got like a playwright power, right?

239
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:53,768
So it's really

240
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:56,408
gonna open up an extensible model of working

241
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:57,048
with Quiro.

242
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,879
Cause I trust me you're gonna have a power for that.

243
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,158
And what we've done is we've, our UX

244
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:06,070
is also

245
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,690
uh very simple.

246
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,210
So within the Quiro interface, so Kiro,

247
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,710
the ID interface,

248
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,629
we have a new power spane.

249
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,109
Where you just click on the power.

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,460
It loads our curated powers, and you can

251
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,979
just one click install it.

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,239
And you will, you see this very shortly.

253
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,229
And as I called out, even from the same interface,

254
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:32,308
you can build your own power

255
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:33,830
or import a power.

256
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,719
So if you got a public GitHub URL, someone

257
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,769
on the Internet shared this power being like, hey, this is

258
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:39,509
a super cool

259
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,229
playwright power I built,

260
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,710
you can just add that and your agent will have

261
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:44,808
awareness of that.

262
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,288
The 2nd use case is a start of

263
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,739
phase 1 of our journey towards more governance

264
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,239
for teams around powers.

265
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,298
Uh, but it'll enable

266
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,019
it alone will already enable teams. So let's say you

267
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,038
have a team and you want, you define,

268
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:00,340
you know, coding,

269
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,200
coding conventions, you define

270
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:05,418
rules around how you work with, uh, particular

271
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,899
technology. You can define that in a repository

272
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,519
with powers, and you can

273
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,048
actually import the power from a folder

274
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:14,599
so each developer can clone the repository

275
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:17,538
to their individual environments and actually import powers.

276
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,048
We're going to make that a lot better in the future.

277
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,320
And finally, this, this kind of organically

278
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,500
came up as we were working with partners

279
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,080
because every partner was saying, hey, like now I've

280
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,418
got to maintain like these

281
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,298
unique files for every for every

282
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:35,500
provider

283
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,149
because as, as we all know, there's a lot of

284
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:39,239
agentic tools out there.

285
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,149
And uh what we wanted

286
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,710
to do was not build something that's proprietary

287
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,849
in nature so hopefully

288
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,229
once we've with the way we built this under the hood

289
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:49,889
is that

290
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,759
uh powers is is itself an MCP

291
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,369
server. So

292
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,590
hopefully once we make this public, we didn't make

293
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,840
this public, uh, immediately, but you

294
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,149
can use powers with,

295
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,379
you know, Klein,

296
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,009
the hero CLI

297
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,320
cursor,

298
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,779
maybe even clot code.

299
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
And hopefully when we, once we do that,

300
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,080
um, you know.

301
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,519
Harry and Tyler here will be able to keep that one

302
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,580
file and actually

303
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,320
if when working with multiple providers

304
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,058
they can just provide

305
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,000
that bundle as context.

306
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,389
And so I think I've

307
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,798
spoken enough about powers here. So let me

308
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:29,989
actually go ahead

309
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,229
and

310
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,330
switch to a live demo.

311
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,928
Since there were many people in the audience

312
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,609
who have not actually used Quiro.

313
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,379
Let me give you a quick,

314
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,320
quick tour of the interface. So Quiro

315
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,359
is an ID fork of code OSS,

316
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,879
and what we really have, uh, is this, so

317
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,940
this Kiropane here.

318
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,288
Has

319
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,250
4

320
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:55,330
features that we launched with,

321
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:58,259
so the application that I'm showing you today is an

322
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,548
application I've built in my last 2 demos. It's a job seeker's

323
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:02,668
app. So, uh, the,

324
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,048
the pitch here and, uh, and my,

325
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,029
my plan is after this I'm gonna

326
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:09,710
quit, quit my job and go build, build the next

327
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,869
billion dollar unicorn

328
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,529
is, uh,

329
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,928
the, the, but the pitch here is that.

330
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,288
People looking for jobs often like

331
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,330
there's tools and there's enough information

332
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,570
available to practice questions, but there isn't

333
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,840
really a way to practice, uh,

334
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,450
like tone and style and how and diction

335
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,908
and how you're answering something

336
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,450
so we built, we live built this

337
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,690
app in a one hour session

338
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,590
where essentially the flow is like.

339
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,519
A user starts an interview. You voice record

340
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,190
the answer.

341
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,019
We transcripted the answer,

342
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,440
and then after you go through the interview,

343
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,178
we send the results to an, uh,

344
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,690
an AI SD cloud SDK

345
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,058
that then

346
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,000
generates a qualitative and quantitative

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,658
score

348
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,678
of your, of how you did.

349
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,899
And we use specs, uh, so if you're not

350
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,229
attended any of the sessions on Quiro,

351
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,879
Specs is the, the unique

352
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,960
feature that we added to the space. It gives a

353
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,379
structured approach to building

354
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,859
with AI because you can really plan

355
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,340
effectively before you go and implement work.

356
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:14,000
So, to give you a, can everyone see the interface

357
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,899
OK? I can, um, I'll just make it a little bigger.

358
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,700
Sorry. To

359
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
give you an overview of the interface, so you start with

360
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,979
a prompt, and what we break that prompt into

361
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:29,418
user stories and acceptance criteria that actually

362
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:30,879
define like your requirements.

363
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,960
Um, so in this case you see things like as a job

364
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,149
interview, as a job seeker I wanna answer interview

365
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,460
questions using voice recording

366
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:39,979
so that I can practice speaking.

367
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,090
Then we, we switched to a design

368
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,219
and the design really like if you look at it, it starts with an architecture

369
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:48,369
diagram, so this is a this is a React application

370
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,969
and it's got all the components and interfaces

371
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,119
within it. And then you get

372
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,719
to a task list, and the task list includes

373
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,219
optional, like optional tasks and required tasks

374
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,019
that you then you can then execute.

375
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,918
Now this entire flow we did this flow in a in a whole

376
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,918
session where we built this application

377
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:08,058
and uh I'll do a quick

378
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,899
demo of the application as well

379
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:11,840
because you can start with an interview.

380
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,190
And Agentic

381
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,399
development. Involves

382
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,428
working with MCPs

383
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,500
context

384
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,058
and tools.

385
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,479
Uh, it's, it's a hard problem to

386
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,200
solve, which is why we launched Powers.

387
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:34,149
Powers was it uh

388
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:38,479
Powers was a technical problem we solved recently.

389
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,609
Uh, we did this in a way where we,

390
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,359
we used the concept of progressive disclosure,

391
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,058
uh, to make

392
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,219
the agent effective.

393
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:54,750
I research things on the Internet

394
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,009
and using

395
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:57,070
social media.

396
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,090
And then what what this app does is that it then

397
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:03,469
sends this data over transcript transcribes

398
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,009
that data and sends it over

399
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,428
the web, the web

400
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,308
to, uh, cloud to the to an to

401
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,408
a model. The model analyzes the results

402
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:12,729
and gives me a score.

403
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,509
Uh, looks like I, I'm

404
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,739
not ready to get my,

405
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,090
get, get a job.

406
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,928
It's a lot of work I gotta do.

407
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,729
Uh, and, and gives you qualitative feedback as

408
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:23,798
well. Cool.

409
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,769
So that was a quick tour of the application.

410
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,250
I, I didn't really talk about the other

411
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,440
features, but we have hooks.

412
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:31,960
Hooks are a way, hooks are life cycle events,

413
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,129
so they actually like watch the IDE

414
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,129
for different events like file save, file

415
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,250
create, uh, we're adding more like

416
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,149
on agent com chat complete.

417
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,639
And you can actually do things, uh, you can

418
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
do actions so you can ask the agent to do

419
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,200
something

420
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:47,129
or you can run commands

421
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,609
it's kind of uh an enforcer if you will,

422
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,058
when you're working with agents.

423
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,129
And then as we talked about MCP and steering

424
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,408
are like ways to guide the agent to give the agent

425
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,428
rules to follow

426
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,229
when they when they build things.

427
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,200
It's a very quick overview of just the core

428
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,989
hero interface.

429
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,330
Um Now, what

430
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,369
we launched with Powers is this

431
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,109
new tab here.

432
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,308
So adding a power here is really easy. So what,

433
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:13,729
what I'm gonna do in this demo

434
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:16,149
is that I have this interface

435
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,190
here that I've built this, this was the interface

436
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,349
I built just in the, in my last session.

437
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,190
But I also have a Figma file that, let's

438
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,359
say my designer built,

439
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,149
and this is, this, this kind of looks much nicer

440
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:28,529
than what you just saw,

441
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:31,149
right? So what I'm gonna do is I'm, I'm

442
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,250
gonna try and get

443
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,609
Hiro to take this to,

444
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:36,690
I'm gonna install the Figma power

445
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,048
and try and have Quiro to go and implement this.

446
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So let's actually go ahead and

447
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,298
install the Figma power.

448
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,298
All right, um, so that that was installed and

449
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:52,989
if you want to take a look at what a power looks like.

450
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,178
The power itself is just it's a

451
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:58,379
markdown file with the power. MD.

452
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,440
Let me open the front matter because it's the markdown

453
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,019
version because it's easier to

454
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,670
understand. So this is what

455
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,789
front matter looks like,

456
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,309
right? And you, as you can see, we have keywords related

457
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:11,709
to Figma like UI design, code,

458
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:12,368
layout,

459
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:15,640
uh, that help the agent

460
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:18,539
decipher when it should actually invoke

461
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,289
this power.

462
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,500
And with this power there's like a workflow defined, you

463
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,799
know, execute this file to generate the right context

464
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,500
for Figma

465
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,318
and so it's, it, it's gonna create something

466
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,358
called a system design rule and then also

467
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:32,459
a hook which uh which we can watch.

468
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,858
And then with the power there's an MCP.

469
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,489
Jason. So this is, this is the MCP configuration.

470
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,180
So Figma has an MCP server

471
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,390
and so

472
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,199
you can add one or more MCPs

473
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,529
within, within a power,

474
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,009
but working with FIGMA, the FGM, they have

475
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:48,608
one MCP.

476
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:51,469
So

477
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,880
now what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm actually

478
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,539
gonna say.

479
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,259
Try power.

480
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:58,519
And see what happens.

481
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,769
So as you can see, it, it, it activated the figma

482
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,809
power. And tells

483
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,789
you what you can do with the figma power.

484
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,598
And the first thing it it's doing, is doing, it's

485
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:17,029
doing this thing called, it's saying it needs to create

486
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,209
design system rules.

487
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,239
Now what create design system rules is a tool

488
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,618
in the MCP for Figma, but

489
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,578
if you were to just download the the Figma MCP

490
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:28,160
and

491
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,519
start working with it,

492
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,640
it wouldn't automatically get invoked.

493
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,449
In fact, you like there's documentation

494
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:36,568
embedded in some Figma link which says

495
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:38,719
like copy this prompt, paste it in, and generate

496
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,318
this file.

497
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,689
What this file does is actually gives the agent

498
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,309
really good context on like

499
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:45,848
how to, uh, it gives Figma and

500
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:46,390
the agent

501
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:49,420
really good context about what the specific

502
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,150
project set up,

503
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,568
uh, what, what the specific project has in

504
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:53,729
terms of a design system.

505
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,140
So, uh,

506
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,039
this should generate shortly.

507
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,140
But it'll have things like what, what is the,

508
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,088
the CSS styling, what's the

509
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:06,219
like design tokens like the what's the, what are, what are layout

510
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,539
rules. Um, so colors,

511
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,098
right, these are all things that Figma finds

512
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,250
very useful and the agent also finds very

513
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,400
useful when, when

514
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,959
it generates code.

515
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,328
Now, it's, so it created the steering

516
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,368
file and it it it's got the steering file with this

517
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,868
inclusion mode as always.

518
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,689
So what this means is now I have the steering file

519
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:26,449
included right here.

520
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:29,739
That every time the agent runs, it will use this

521
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,779
file as context because Figma really thinks that this

522
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,019
is an important file for the agent to have

523
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,848
access to. And

524
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:38,598
second, it created something called, uh,

525
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:41,568
this is slightly more contextual

526
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:43,769
to like an audience that's familiar

527
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:44,348
with Figma,

528
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,380
but it created a hook called Figma

529
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,828
component code connect.

530
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,979
Now what that does is that Figma has this concept

531
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,029
of components.

532
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,608
In your UI you have conceptual components, and you can

533
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,779
really map the two together.

534
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:58,969
So,

535
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,750
what, the way this hook runs is that it says that on

536
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,000
every, it should, it should be in every file

537
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,219
create. It'll basically

538
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,559
map try and map the component to

539
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:10,910
the Figma

540
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:12,259
version of the component.

541
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,029
So that's really what you can get with this power. So right

542
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,430
at the box, you get an onboarding experience that's fully guided,

543
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:19,969
that isn't just, OK, go install an MCP server

544
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,618
from the docks and figure out how to work with it.

545
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,368
And as a developer, there's nothing more important than

546
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,229
staying in the flow.

547
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,828
Right, so

548
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,368
All right, so it's saying, OK, great, my Sigma power

549
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,739
is now up and ready to use.

550
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,380
And it's giving me some examples again, so this is,

551
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,739
this is all very useful because it

552
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,979
gives you, it's almost like documentation that you'd have to follow

553
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,779
but without leaving your editor.

554
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,430
Now, if I were to go to Figma, Figma has this feature

555
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,949
called Dev mode right here,

556
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,449
which allows me to select a component.

557
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,900
And I can just copy this example prompt.

558
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:08,420
That says implement this design from Figma.

559
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:11,049
And then I go in here

560
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,969
Um, and I'm gonna just go ahead and paste that.

561
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:16,828
And let's see what the agent does.

562
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,309
Hopefully this works.

563
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,189
Yep, so it's trying to get this

564
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:29,170
tool from Figma.

565
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,309
I'm just gonna go ahead and auto approve.

566
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,509
The tools would never ask me for permission

567
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:46,368
again. Um.

568
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,078
OK, great.

569
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,400
OK, so now it's connected to the Figma I fetched that frame

570
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
and what you can see it says I've found this

571
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,039
topic. Let me convert this design

572
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,618
to match your project CSS approach. So it's taking

573
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,939
like the Figma context

574
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,348
and it's got context because it includes

575
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:21,259
that design context file at the beginning.

576
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,078
It is going to say, oh wow, like it's

577
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,118
now I can understand what you've got in your

578
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:27,500
project and what Figma has,

579
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,618
and it's now gonna go ahead and

580
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,160
create a new enhanced topic

581
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,088
card component.

582
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,539
Let's see how it does.

583
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:37,118
So the interesting, the funny thing here is like I've,

584
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,078
I did this like 2 times before the demo

585
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,979
and both times the results were slightly different

586
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,029
and that is just the nature of working with

587
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:47,059
uh AI systems right now,

588
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,759
uh, but they were close enough so I'm hoping

589
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,618
this is this this version is also

590
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:53,959
gonna be um pretty good.

591
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:04,568
So this is the other cool thing we've launched with Quiro

592
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:06,568
this in the last couple of months.

593
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,529
When we first launched Quiro, the agent would

594
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,848
have a lot more errors in the

595
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,328
actual interface, and it requires some back and

596
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,130
forth to fix them.

597
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:17,759
But we launched diagnostics tool support

598
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,160
which actually can look at find like linting lint

599
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,239
issues, linting errors,

600
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,598
and we launched support for like dev server so it can

601
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:25,598
read like compile time errors and, and the agent

602
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:27,180
just like auto recovers itself

603
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,068
so it's, it's, I was able to do

604
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,368
most all my demos this, this reinvent uh

605
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,420
this is my 4th session

606
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,739
without the agent really making

607
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,019
mistakes which has been super cool.

608
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,108
And now I'm gonna jinx myself for sure.

609
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,539
While this is happening, let me just show you how

610
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,939
I can, how easy it is to create a power.

611
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,439
So I have this power that I've built,

612
00:23:58,469 --> 00:23:59,348
um,

613
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,380
I, I really like so Chrome has a devtools

614
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
server that what what it lets you do

615
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,799
is it it it actually will run Chrome

616
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,500
and be able to do things like click on components

617
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,920
test for responsiveness.

618
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,479
Check, like, make hover effects, uh,

619
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:15,348
it can do a lot,

620
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:18,009
um, so I've set up this, uh, Chrome

621
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,410
Dev Tools power and,

622
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:21,769
uh, it's essentially got two files. It's got a

623
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:22,709
power. MD file.

624
00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:25,640
With like instructions for what to do

625
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,239
and an MCPJS and an MCPJN file.

626
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,959
Now, for me to add this to Quiro, it's gonna

627
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,180
be um

628
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,719
super easy. I would just go into

629
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,699
Quiro here

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,539
in the cust say add custom power.

631
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,269
Import a power from a folder.

632
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:42,930
Uh.

633
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,750
And there, now I have a Chrome Dev

634
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,868
Tools UI testing power available to me as

635
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,209
well. OK, so it implemented

636
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,328
something. Let's see how it did what it did.

637
00:24:58,259 --> 00:24:58,789
All right.

638
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,039
Oh, not bad.

639
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,088
It's pretty good.

640
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,380
And let's, let's actually now go ahead and see if like

641
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,459
I can invoke the Chrome Dev Tools power,

642
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:13,630
OK, uh, now

643
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,078
run Chrome Dev Tools to make sure.

644
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,979
Everything is OK.

645
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:36,500
OK, so it's running a background power.

646
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:38,500
And let's see if it

647
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,989
OK, great.

648
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,009
Oh, did I have my MCP

649
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:44,469
on? Oh, I'm,

650
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:46,969
I cheated a little bit. I unfortunately had

651
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:48,150
not disabled the

652
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:50,930
the actual MCP server, but that's

653
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,348
fine, um.

654
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:55,400
So what, what this is gonna do now is that you see how it

655
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,769
opened its own instance and now check out what it's

656
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:58,328
gonna do.

657
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,269
It's gonna see, so Dev serve is running

658
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,039
now. There's a, the new design is rendering great.

659
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:05,368
Let me check the console for any errors. So look

660
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:07,689
at the runtime, look at the actual console runtime,

661
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,529
see if the errors. OK, no errors. Now let me test the hover

662
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:17,689
effects. And

663
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:19,880
so it's gonna allow actually like hover on the UI

664
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,309
component I believe the UI component has some hover states

665
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,630
to see if the hover works.

666
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:28,670
And now it's doing OK, how is this gonna work on a mobile

667
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,809
device? It's gonna resize the,

668
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:31,828
the, the page.

669
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:41,108
And yeah, so this, so I think you, you, you

670
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:43,108
get the gist of it. So the, the powers really give

671
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:45,430
you the ability, the agent ability like a

672
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,890
toolkit abilities, a Swiss Army knife of abilities

673
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:50,430
without overwhelming it with context, and

674
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,709
I, I kind of walked you through the Figma use case.

675
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:54,049
I'm gonna, uh,

676
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,689
ask Harry to come on and, and, uh,

677
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,689
talk about Postman. Awesome.

678
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:08,068
Uh, where I'm at here.

679
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:12,430
Hi everybody. My name's uh Harry Mauer. I'm the Field

680
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,969
CTO of Postman, and in my role, I

681
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,269
help our largest customers improve their

682
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,088
overall software development process.

683
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,289
Um,

684
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:22,750
how many of you familiar with Postman? How many of you use

685
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,150
Postman? Yeah, there you go.

686
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:26,630
So for those that haven't, um, Postman

687
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,890
is the most widely used tool to

688
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,789
test and design and to manage your APIs.

689
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:34,390
We're used by over 40 million developers.

690
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:37,098
Over 500,000 organizations have adopted

691
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:39,420
us, and we've become one of those,

692
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,709
uh, indispensable tools in the developer

693
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:42,630
toolkit, sort of like,

694
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:45,219
you know, Git and VS code, strong coffee,

695
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,269
and, uh, noise canceling headphones, right?

696
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,578
We're part of the, the tool chest that every

697
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:50,150
developer

698
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:51,390
typically uses.

699
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,078
Um, for those that aren't familiar with me, I

700
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,189
had a long history in developer tools.

701
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,559
Um, I spent a long time at Microsoft in Developer Tools.

702
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,739
I ran, uh,

703
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,078
Dev Tools for Red Hat for a long time. I

704
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:04,509
actually worked on Dev Tools at AWS,

705
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,160
and now I'm here at Postman, and I've never been more

706
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,348
excited about software development. I

707
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:10,259
feel like my entire

708
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,799
20+ year career has led to this

709
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,799
point where my code is finally

710
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,118
able to write my code, right? And it's just

711
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,199
awesome how much you can get done

712
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,640
in just a short amount of time with these tools, but.

713
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:23,009
For as

714
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:25,358
powerful as they are, uh, they still need

715
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:27,449
a lot of guidance, right? So as Nikil was saying, they're

716
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,479
very much generous, and they need a lot

717
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,739
of guidance and knowledge

718
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,390
to help them do the job in the way that you want them to do it,

719
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,799
right? So you gotta tell them what kind of framework

720
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,920
to use and what kind of language to use, and

721
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,640
importantly for Postman, which APIs

722
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,989
you want to use to build in your

723
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,108
application. Um, and this

724
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,118
is where we see Postman continuing to

725
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:48,750
play an indispensable role, right?

726
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,358
As I mentioned, millions of developers use

727
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,439
Postman to collaborate and build their

728
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,519
APIs and test them and manage them. And

729
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,880
increasingly those developers are being joined

730
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,160
by countless numbers of agents,

731
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,519
right? So agents now are wanting

732
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,519
to do the same thing that developers did.

733
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:05,459
They want to

734
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,858
test their APIs, they want to,

735
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
uh, share the APIs, and they want to do

736
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
that not only with other developers, but with other

737
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,078
agents as well.

738
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,969
And today we enable that

739
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:18,750
through our Postman MCP server. So

740
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,088
there's an MCP server out there today that you can use

741
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,150
within whichever coding agent

742
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,269
or assistant that supports MCP that

743
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:26,229
you wanna use,

744
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:28,828
but there's some limitations to it, and this is

745
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:30,900
why we're so excited to be partnering with the Quiro

746
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,608
team, right?

747
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,368
You know, for instance, we want to provide a

748
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:36,689
lot of capabilities to those MCP

749
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:37,279
servers,

750
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:39,650
so we have over 100 tools, but most of

751
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,759
them really can't deal with that many tools, right?

752
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,930
So we have a slimmed down version which only has 40

753
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,009
tools, which can also sometimes

754
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,828
overwhelm them, right? So one of the things we're really

755
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,529
excited about in here is the ability for that to automatically

756
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,809
load after we

757
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,529
install uh the, the MCP

758
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:55,269
server, right?

759
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:58,140
And the other thing that

760
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,180
we usually stumble upon is when someone

761
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,630
goes to use our MCP server,

762
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,219
we're relying on them to actually write

763
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:04,759
the

764
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,459
system prompts to make it more effective, right?

765
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:09,900
And so now with Kira, we have these steering files, and

766
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,140
we can package all this up into a power

767
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,338
that makes our MCP server much

768
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:16,338
more powerful for the agent to

769
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:18,479
use. And so

770
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:20,299
rather than me talking about it, I wanna give you a quick demo.

771
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,838
Uh, I am not as fearless as Nikhil, so

772
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,910
I recorded mine. Um, let's see if we can

773
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,739
get the video going.

774
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,400
So I've got a, uh, sample application. It's

775
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,479
a personal finance application. It's interesting,

776
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,529
me and Tyler both started working on the same thing.

777
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,479
Um,

778
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,880
it's pretty robust. It's got a

779
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,959
lot of the same things that you would expect to have

780
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,199
in a large enterprise scale application. It's

781
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,640
got a query PI. It's got an SDK,

782
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:43,769
it's got a CLI.

783
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,699
And I use Postman to help

784
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:49,338
manage all of the different versions

785
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:51,618
and share those APIs with

786
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:52,459
my team.

787
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,989
So in my pipelines, I automatically generate

788
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:57,219
a collection and a spec for each

789
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:57,838
version,

790
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,140
and I do that as part of my pipeline

791
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,199
process. But when I want

792
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:05,400
to build an API that I can collaborate on,

793
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,959
one that's still in development,

794
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,358
I also want to create a collection and be able to share

795
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:11,618
that with my other development teams.

796
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,680
So through the new Quiro Power,

797
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:16,039
um, I can do that with, right with inside my

798
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,199
IDE. Here's a sample prompt I put

799
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,289
together. I'm asking Kira to

800
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:22,439
create a collection based

801
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,469
off an endpoint within my

802
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:26,059
API for just reporting.

803
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,410
And one of the things that we tell in the steering file is

804
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,529
we tell Kira to keep

805
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,838
a Postman.json file

806
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,689
for all of the metadata about the

807
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:37,130
workspace and the collection and the user

808
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,049
information that we use,

809
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,529
and we build upon that as we go because it's

810
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:42,529
gonna help some of our more advanced features

811
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,189
like the hooks work later on.

812
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,068
So as

813
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,910
Kira goes through the process here.

814
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
It's going to use my API key

815
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,430
to collect, to connect to Postman.

816
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,318
It's going to read my code,

817
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:56,759
understand the endpoints that I need to make,

818
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:58,979
and then it automatically creates this collection

819
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:00,900
inside of my workspace

820
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,979
that now I can share with my team,

821
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,459
right? So it's got everything it needs here.

822
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,189
And you should see that here. So there, there's my

823
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:10,348
new uh endpoint in development.

824
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:13,269
This is pretty cool, but if someone went to go to use this,

825
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,469
it wouldn't really work. It would tell them what the input was

826
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,588
supposed to look like, but there's no real way to test

827
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:19,588
this. And so one of the cool features inside of Postman

828
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:20,170
is the ability

829
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:22,709
to create mock servers and environments

830
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:25,029
for APIs that aren't quite finished yet,

831
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:27,568
right? So I can mock out this environment.

832
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:31,140
I can share that with the team who needs it downstream

833
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,650
while I'm continuing to develop the implementation.

834
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,500
And so I can do that now inside directly

835
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,618
inside a hero instead of having to do that inside a Postman.

836
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,559
I don't ever have to leave

837
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,118
my IDE, so.

838
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,000
Another prompt I asked, I tell Kira, hey, let's

839
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,358
take that collection you just built, the one you just saved

840
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:48,358
inside of that JSON file, and now let's build

841
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,519
a mock environment and server

842
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,039
for that,

843
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,559
so that we can test these directly, or we can

844
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,699
test these without the implementation being completed.

845
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,239
So it's gonna go through the process here of doing that.

846
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,549
And again, as it does this, it

847
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,969
keeps adding to that metadata, and the reason it can

848
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:05,170
do that is because we told it to do that in the steering

849
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:05,848
file, right?

850
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,239
If I had to rely on the end user to

851
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,489
do that, you, I don't, I couldn't rely on you

852
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,449
all to do that, right?

853
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,809
So we automatically package that up for you to do that.

854
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,789
Uh, so the mock server was automatically

855
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,920
created. And

856
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
again, this, the only thing I had to tell Kierra to

857
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
do was look at my code, right? I didn't have

858
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,180
to write a spec. I didn't have to do anything like that. I said,

859
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:27,519
investigate, look at my code, create this collection.

860
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:28,880
Once you create the collection,

861
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,838
now you know everything about that,

862
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,598
go create this virtual environment inside of Postman.

863
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,160
which has a mock server in it, and all the environment variables

864
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,180
that I need. And now I can actually go

865
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:41,759
and test this and get, oh, and get test data

866
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,979
back to be able to run that collection, right?

867
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,568
Um, and as I said, this is really great because, you know, now

868
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,568
I don't have to, the other team, if I'm a downstream

869
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,568
team, I don't have to wait on me to

870
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:52,189
finish it,

871
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,689
and I can also just start to test

872
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:55,348
that right here

873
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,189
inside Akira, so I wanna make sure it works for the other team.

874
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:00,868
Now why this is cool and why I wanted to show this is.

875
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,630
This is a standard test that we're gonna run,

876
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,039
not only just to validate the collection work and

877
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,449
the mock environment worked,

878
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:09,929
but it's also gonna be called every

879
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,969
time I make a change to the source

880
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,128
code, because I automatically packaged a

881
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:15,010
Quiro hook

882
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,519
inside of it. So one of the things that you would do as you're

883
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,719
developing your APIs, you want to go back and test it and make sure

884
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,378
everything works.

885
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:23,090
So now automatically when I change the source

886
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,478
code and save it,

887
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:27,000
Kiiro knows that because there's a hook inside of there, and it's

888
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,978
going to run that same

889
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:30,760
collection in that mock environment that we created

890
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
and make sure everything still works, right? So now we've

891
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,978
got this closed loop system.

892
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,059
So this is one small example. Like I said, we have

893
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:39,500
over 100 tools inside of our MCP server.

894
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,019
You know, you can do everything from creating collections and workspaces

895
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,059
and sharing them and also generating other code.

896
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,179
So we're really interested

897
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,300
and excited to see what y'all are gonna do with it. It's

898
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,489
available today. You can go install it from the

899
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,539
Quiro marketplace, and we also have a

900
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,559
Discord server. We'd love to get your feedback.

901
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,260
Uh, so if you could take the time to join, we'd

902
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
love to hear it, and, uh, you know, hopefully you'll

903
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,699
get a lot of value out of it. So thank you.

904
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:04,000
Tyler.

905
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,909
Let's see your personal finance app.

906
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,228
Thanks, Harry.

907
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:17,159
Cool. Hi

908
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,110
everyone. I'm

909
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,378
Tyler and I'm, uh, Deverel at

910
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:23,030
Superbase,

911
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,628
and today I'm gonna talk to you about

912
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:26,309
Superbase

913
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,869
and the Koower that we're launching.

914
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,800
For those who don't know what Superbeast is,

915
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:33,989
Superbeast

916
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:36,039
is a back-end platform

917
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,340
loved by many developers

918
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,239
across the world.

919
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,679
We have 5 million

920
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,579
developers shipping over

921
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,360
90,000 databases

922
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,360
every single day.

923
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,869
And we have shipped in total

924
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,409
60 million databases.

925
00:35:55,668 --> 00:36:08,429
Today Earlier

926
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:09,000
this year,

927
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,000
we shipped our MCP server.

928
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,280
The Superbase MCP server

929
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:17,050
includes numerous tools

930
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:19,099
for building applications on

931
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:20,019
top of Superbase.

932
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,239
You can do things like

933
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,559
list out tables.

934
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,329
Manage your database migrations.

935
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,329
Manage your storage bucket,

936
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,269
really anything that you can do

937
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,809
within the Superbase platform.

938
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,648
This MC MCP server

939
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,590
forms the backbone of our QO

940
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,820
power. And

941
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,000
I am happy

942
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,199
to announce.

943
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
The QO power for Superbass.

944
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,878
We are announcing two QO powers from

945
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:56,478
Superbase.

946
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,139
1. To work with your

947
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,530
local Superbase database.

948
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,579
And another

949
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,239
to work with a hosted Subabase database.

950
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,179
So that you can start locally.

951
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,809
And deploy your Superbase database

952
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:12,820
to your cloud.

953
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,878
It uses a Superbase MCP

954
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,719
and the Superbase CLI

955
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:21,079
to build,

956
00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:22,099
manage,

957
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,280
debug,

958
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,260
and scale application

959
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,300
with the help

960
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,519
from an LLM.

961
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:33,090
Not just having access to these tools,

962
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,889
but the superbase KO powers.

963
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:39,070
Understands the best practices.

964
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:41,179
of how to use

965
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,519
Superbase

966
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,090
and how to use Eposcus database.

967
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,918
So you don't have to be a database expert.

968
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,728
In order to get building

969
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,829
on a Poscu database.

970
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,938
Now let's see it in action.

971
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,619
It's all good.

972
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:12,378
So I'm gonna start

973
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:15,489
With a plain

974
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,309
beat up. I'm

975
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:21,168
gonna go ahead

976
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,708
and install the superbase

977
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,550
local kilo kilopower.

978
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,938
I'm gonna hit install

979
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,760
and hit try power,

980
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:30,938
and off we go.

981
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,750
We're going to start up by the.

982
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:35,889
Onboarding flow,

983
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:38,208
and it's going to check things like

984
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,250
whether I have docker running,

985
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:43,329
whether I have the Super BCLI installed.

986
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,409
And whether I have initialized

987
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:48,188
the Superbase project

988
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,228
uh within the working directory.

989
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,889
Now, I hadn't initialized Superbeast in

990
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:57,010
here, so it went ahead and initialized

991
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,090
Subabeast for me.

992
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,208
And then now it's fetching the Superbase

993
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,110
credentials

994
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,070
and creating an environment

995
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,929
bearable environment file

996
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,010
for me within this project directory.

997
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,840
Now, once all the initial setup is done, we

998
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,860
are going to jump into building some

999
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,878
tables.

1000
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:21,409
So,

1001
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:24,148
I'm also gonna work on a personal

1002
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,668
financing, personal banking app.

1003
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,519
So I'm telling Keo here

1004
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:32,239
to create all the tables

1005
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,619
that you need in order to build a

1006
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,000
personal banking app.

1007
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:41,510
And Keo is able to

1008
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,099
understand all the best practices

1009
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,829
to build tables,

1010
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,239
best security practices when it

1011
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,239
comes to Superbase,

1012
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,519
and incorporate all that

1013
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:51,039
in here.

1014
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,500
So it has created the tables,

1015
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,369
it has created all the necessary security

1016
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:00,469
safeguards.

1017
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,320
To make sure we create a nice

1018
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,829
and safe

1019
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:04,898
banking app.

1020
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:07,918
Now one of the key

1021
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:09,398
powers

1022
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,398
that we're shipping

1023
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,438
is this

1024
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:12,500
security check.

1025
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,958
It's part of a Sub core feature,

1026
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:18,340
and what it allows you to do is it.

1027
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,159
It's able to take in all the best

1028
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,639
security practices and make sure all the tables

1029
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,000
and various configurations are following

1030
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,559
those security best practices.

1031
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,519
I'm gonna go ahead and run it

1032
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:34,628
And it actually found something, some

1033
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:35,179
problems.

1034
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,619
So Ko was able to quickly fix that

1035
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,050
up. By running

1036
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,780
another SQL

1037
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,168
segment. Now,

1038
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,280
another favorite thing

1039
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,019
about Superbase, another favorite thing

1040
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:50,559
of mine

1041
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:51,860
about Subabase,

1042
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,599
is that it can generate type script types

1043
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,559
that matches

1044
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:57,019
your table schema.

1045
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,489
And Keo's doing that for me,

1046
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,958
without me having to tell it to generate

1047
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:03,739
all these type,

1048
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,000
TypeScript types.

1049
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,639
It's able to understand

1050
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,958
that we're working in a TypeScript environment.

1051
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:11,829
And Subabase has this TypeScript

1052
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,530
generation feature.

1053
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,519
And we should probably generate some type script types.

1054
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:21,000
And

1055
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,418
there you go. Here it has created

1056
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,860
the TypeScript types and now installing the Superbase

1057
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,280
JavaScript client library.

1058
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,688
So generating all these TypeScript types,

1059
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:32,159
installing the Superbase client libraries,

1060
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,840
these are standard practices that we follow.

1061
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,269
And

1062
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,429
he was able to do that

1063
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:39,978
um without

1064
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,500
me having to interfere

1065
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,719
with any of the prompts.

1066
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,659
It understands all these best, best practices,

1067
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,079
uh, that it needs to do in order to get

1068
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,260
started with a super-based project.

1069
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:55,340
Now, finally, once all the tables are created,

1070
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,139
all the configuration is set,

1071
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:59,478
Keo's generating all the

1072
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:01,139
database migrations.

1073
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:14,969
And after a while,

1074
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,728
let's check out the migration file that I created.

1075
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:21,840
So you can see,

1076
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:22,929
QO has created

1077
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:25,208
a nice account stable for us

1078
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,570
with all the comms that you would need

1079
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,500
for a personal banking apps,

1080
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:30,789
like user ID,

1081
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,869
account type,

1082
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:33,648
balance, currencies,

1083
00:42:36,648 --> 00:42:39,148
It also generated other tables too, like

1084
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:40,119
budgets,

1085
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,188
categories,

1086
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,510
transactions.

1087
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,360
All the tables that you would expect in a

1088
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,519
personal banking app.

1089
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,610
And then you can view that

1090
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,360
within the Superbase dashboard.

1091
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,889
You can see the transaction tables,

1092
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,010
budgets tables,

1093
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:58,829
all being associated

1094
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,349
to the Aha user ID table.

1095
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:04,188
So it has taken all the best practices

1096
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:05,489
that Superbase offers.

1097
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:07,918
And put it all together.

1098
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:12,570
Now let's come back to QO.

1099
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:14,668
And keep going

1100
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:19,929
So it's now

1101
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,010
generating some front-end code

1102
00:43:22,628 --> 00:43:24,369
to connect to our Superbase database.

1103
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,769
This is a TypeScript type that I mentioned

1104
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:34,039
earlier. And

1105
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,128
as, as you can see, we have all the

1106
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,750
matching typescript type that matches the table

1107
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,809
schema. Now, let's

1108
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:43,010
go ahead and create a new chat session.

1109
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:45,610
And work on the UI.

1110
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:50,628
So the prompt here that I'm giving it is basically

1111
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,760
saying, hey,

1112
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:54,418
I have these tables in my Superbase project.

1113
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:57,619
Please create a UI that matches

1114
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,139
what I have in the tables.

1115
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,478
This is one of the neat tricks that I like

1116
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:03,519
to work on, uh, neat. This is

1117
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,530
one of the neat tricks that I like

1118
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,719
to use when building apps using Superbase and

1119
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,840
large language models. I like to start

1120
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,780
from the tables.

1121
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:13,969
And then once I'm done with the tables,

1122
00:44:14,378 --> 00:44:15,820
I have it generate the UI

1123
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,659
because having a nice airtight table

1124
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,860
structure is

1125
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:20,780
very important.

1126
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:23,769
And once all the tables in place,

1127
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:25,438
LLMs are generally

1128
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:27,659
really good at understanding what's going on

1129
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:29,958
and figuring out the best UI

1130
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,559
that goes with those tables.

1131
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:39,978
So Ko is analyzing all the schema

1132
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:41,039
that we generated.

1133
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,309
And it's generating all these UI code

1134
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:47,550
to display.

1135
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,478
What we saw in the database

1136
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:52,059
on the front end code.

1137
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,010
And just like that,

1138
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:05,820
We have

1139
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,628
some nice set of proto code.

1140
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,378
Let's run the local dev server.

1141
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:11,110
And check it out.

1142
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:13,228
So

1143
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:16,409
The UA looks good, it looks

1144
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:17,188
like a personal banking app,

1145
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,570
but we don't see any data, right? Well, that's

1146
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,949
because we just created the tables, but we haven't

1147
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:23,889
inserted any data into it.

1148
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:25,519
Obviously.

1149
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:29,208
So, Let's go back

1150
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,769
and ask Keo to add some dummy data into the database.

1151
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:35,699
And Keo, again,

1152
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:36,780
is able to

1153
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:37,898
figure out

1154
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,398
how to insert dummy data into Superbase, what

1155
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:41,500
the best practice is.

1156
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,289
And it's running

1157
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,708
some SQL command

1158
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:45,989
to insert.

1159
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,349
Some dummy data into all the tables that

1160
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,168
we created earlier.

1161
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:58,050
And after inserting all these data

1162
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,398
in 4 different tables,

1163
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:02,750
It double checked, double checks

1164
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,469
that all the data has been inserted.

1165
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,188
And then I've asked you to

1166
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,409
create a local

1167
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,728
seed file to keep all these dummy data.

1168
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:15,559
Persisted within this project.

1169
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:17,750
Looks great.

1170
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,019
Let's go ahead and check it out.

1171
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:27,489
Now, Within the superbase

1172
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,228
stable, we had those dummy data,

1173
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:30,269
but it looked like.

1174
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:32,750
We haven't signed into the app yet.

1175
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,958
So, I'm asking Kyo to add authentication

1176
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,079
to the app.

1177
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,469
And Keel's able to

1178
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,688
figure out.

1179
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:50,458
The structure of the Superbase project,

1180
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:51,530
the fact that,

1181
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,260
um, obviously the passwords are encrypted,

1182
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:57,619
so you wouldn't be able to insert just 123456

1183
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,079
into the passwords column,

1184
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,519
you need to properly

1185
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:03,159
encrypt or hash the passwords.

1186
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:06,349
It's able to figure out how Superbase

1187
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:08,628
does it. And

1188
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,090
Able to do that.

1189
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,119
It's able to self-correct it.

1190
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,030
So on the first shot,

1191
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:17,070
we missed it,

1192
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:19,389
but I've gone ahead and uh

1193
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:20,228
asked you to.

1194
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:22,148
Make some fixes

1195
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:31,550
And

1196
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,208
It's on its own, was able

1197
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:36,010
to figure out

1198
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,070
that, OK, the Superbase local

1199
00:47:38,378 --> 00:47:40,530
dev server needs to relaunch.

1200
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:42,050
So without me telling it,

1201
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:43,809
he was stopping the Superbase dev server,

1202
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,199
relaunching it,

1203
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,570
loading in all the see data

1204
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,929
that we created again,

1205
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,550
and resetting the scene

1206
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:54,369
so that the proper authenticated user

1207
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:55,228
is created

1208
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,449
within the database.

1209
00:47:57,329 --> 00:47:58,208
And so far,

1210
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:00,489
I have done minimal steering.

1211
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:02,889
It's all the Keog's steering file

1212
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,519
that's doing all the heavy lifting.

1213
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:16,820
And with some edits from Ko.

1214
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:20,039
We are able to sign into the app,

1215
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:21,378
and as you can see,

1216
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,739
you can view all the dummy data that

1217
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:24,599
Qo created

1218
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:27,320
in this nicely authenticated, proper

1219
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:28,800
personal banking app.

1220
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:30,438
So that was QO Power

1221
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:32,059
from Superbase.

1222
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,019
Again, we have the local version and hosted version.

1223
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:36,809
And I hope you like

1224
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,878
I hope you liked what you saw, see, and I

1225
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,668
cannot wait to see what you build with it.

1226
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:42,800
Thank you so much.

1227
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:48,250
Thank you again Harry and Tyler. That was

1228
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,340
really great. Uh, we really appreciate both of, both

1229
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,679
of you coming here and talking about

1230
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:55,019
the powers and, and this both powers

1231
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,070
are super useful. I've been using both of them for,

1232
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:58,958
for my own application development,

1233
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,579
so I, I, I've, I've really benefited

1234
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,579
from actually learning a lot about Postman and

1235
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:04,300
Super Bass

1236
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:05,800
over this last month.

1237
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:08,840
Cool. So what's next? There's a lot of, uh,

1238
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:09,829
a lot of questions,

1239
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,860
uh, I think available in the CLI

1240
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:14,139
we wanna actually make we have a hero CLI

1241
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:14,909
if you don't know,

1242
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,688
uh, we also wanna make it available more broadly.

1243
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,478
Uh, more use cases, more partners, we've, we

1244
00:49:20,478 --> 00:49:21,739
have a, uh,

1245
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,019
on our website

1246
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:25,438
we have a way for you to submit, uh, a

1247
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:27,668
form and actually send us powers,

1248
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:29,320
and we, we're reviewing them

1249
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:31,478
weekly and if we find interesting ones

1250
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,878
we can curate them.

1251
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:35,159
You can do it as an individual as well, by the way. It doesn't

1252
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:36,579
have to be your organization.

1253
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:39,250
If you have uh a specific use case that

1254
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,099
you wanna highlight

1255
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,539
and it and we're we're

1256
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,579
it meets our bar for adding

1257
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:45,938
him on we we're happy to do it.

1258
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:47,860
Um,

1259
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,289
I think organizational use use cases are gonna

1260
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:52,860
be a big one. So being able to govern like powers

1261
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,039
around what powers teams can install

1262
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,340
is gonna be, uh, another feature that

1263
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:57,918
we add,

1264
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,648
and I think our, our goal here is really for Quiro.

1265
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,639
The, the keyro agent has powers,

1266
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:05,458
and over time, like, uh, a key agent

1267
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:07,208
should be able to discover powers and say, hey,

1268
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,860
you're trying to do this. I know there's a power to do to

1269
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,599
solve this problem

1270
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:12,639
without the user actually having to like

1271
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:14,800
explicitly go and say anything.

1272
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,340
Yeah, so, as I, as we said, you can go ahead and start using

1273
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,579
it right away on Quiro, and thank you so much again

1274
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:24,320
everyone for taking your time. I appreciate

1275
