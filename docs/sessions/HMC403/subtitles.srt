1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,767
- [Robert] Las Vegas,
welcome to our session,

2
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,590
"Build and Optimize Edge Architectures

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,120
for Resiliency with AI."

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,740
It's a 400 level code talk,

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,290
and if this is your first code talk,

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,520
it's also my first code talk.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,520
We're super excited to take
advantage of this format.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,410
Previously, we've had
things like chalk talks,

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,497
we've had a chance to whiteboard,

10
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:19,065
"Hey, this is what we think
this could look like."

11
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,320
Or a workshop, "Hey, come follow
along with me as we build."

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,840
But now we have an opportunity
to code in front of you.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,090
This is live, anything could happen,

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,530
but we think it's a really exciting format

15
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,852
to learn and build together.

16
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,730
And because we have a nice,

17
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,343
small and intimate room setting,

18
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:36,150
we highly encourage questions.

19
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,492
So if you want to see us build

20
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:39,030
or tweak something different,

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,260
we'd love to hear your feedback.

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,840
But by way of introduction,
I'm Robbie Belson.

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm a developer advocate
based in New York City.

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,670
I focus on hybrid and edge services,

25
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,230
and specifically its application

26
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,600
with generative and agentic AI.

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,207
And my co-pilot for this afternoon

28
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:55,380
is the (indistinct)
- Hello, everyone.

29
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,120
- Jesus Federico, you
wanna introduce yourself?

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,580
- [Jesus] Sure, hi everyone,
my name is Jesus Federico.

31
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,934
I'm a principal solution architect

32
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,970
with focus on generative AI.

33
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,740
I used to work for the Telco Vertical,

34
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,380
now I'm focused on fully on gen AI part.

35
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,930
- [Robert] Fun fact, we
used to both work together

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,310
in the Telco Vertical.

37
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,030
So we've been working hard
on related topics here

38
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,770
for well over a year, and excited to share

39
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,150
not only what we've developed here,

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,983
but what we've been learning

41
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:20,610
from customers in some of their feedback

42
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,850
and how it applies to some
of these best practices.

43
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,400
So before we start coding,
since we have an hour together,

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,020
I think the theory is very important,

45
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,910
what we're doing and why we're doing it.

46
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,250
And I think it's always helpful to start

47
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,190
with a level-setting exercise
because I find, you know,

48
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,870
even as we go turn back the
clock to re:Invent 2019, what?

49
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,972
Six years ago when we first announced

50
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:44,610
a lot of these AWS
hybrid and edge services,

51
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,400
Outposts, Local Zones, Wavelength Zones,

52
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,410
all part of this cloud
continuum, we wanted

53
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,270
to create a consistent
set of AWS services,

54
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,825
the same set of APIs,
operational consistency,

55
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:02,250
and the same services
you know and love exactly

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,410
where developers and
builders need it most.

57
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,850
So just by way of hands,

58
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,320
how many of you have had a chance

59
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,652
to experiment with a Local Zone

60
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,023
or an Outpost or a Wavelength Zone?

61
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,280
Okay, so I think I see two or three hands.

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,100
that is super consistent
across all the six re:Invents

63
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,180
that I've had a chance to build with.

64
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,070
We often find that these sessions,

65
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,530
folks come who are new
to all of these services.

66
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,820
So we always figured, you know,

67
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,825
even though it's a 400 level
chalk talk, we want to start,

68
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,350
or code talk rather, we
wanna start with the basics

69
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,330
and recognize that many of you have yet

70
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,400
to build across that cloud continuum.

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,820
Many of you have built on our AWS Regions,

72
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,020
but if you haven't had a chance to build

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,400
with some of these other services,

74
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,250
the fundamental question we asked was

75
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
how could we bring these cloud services

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,430
you know and love closer to where

77
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,140
that data is being produced and consumed,

78
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,560
or in a city near you, or
within the customer premise?

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,210
So just to define our terms as we go

80
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,500
from the left to the right,

81
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,530
you take that broad and deep
set of services in the region

82
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,600
and you can extend it to metro areas

83
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,180
where maybe no such AWS
region exists today.

84
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,330
And that's what we'll
call an AWS Local Zone.

85
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,820
We can further extend those cloud services

86
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,610
you know and love to the customer premise.

87
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,610
42U rack, mountable compute

88
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,020
that we bring to the customer premise,

89
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,570
we call that an AWS Outpost.

90
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,370
And we have a number
of other services here

91
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,291
that service the customer premise,

92
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,300
such as EKS Hybrid Nodes,

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,160
where virtually any physical

94
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,350
or virtual machine can connect back

95
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,280
to remote Kubernetes
control plane managed by us

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,330
in EKS Hybrid Nodes.

97
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,608
And then of course, a number of services

98
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:37,830
to support far edge devices.

99
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,620
We're gonna focus today most
on Local Zones and Outposts.

100
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,610
We see a lot of customers.

101
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,050
So Jesus mentioned we both

102
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,670
supported telecommunications.

103
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,009
It's very common for a
telecommunications customer

104
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,340
to think about using
Local Zones and Outposts

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,800
to help build out their network.

106
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,050
You might have a media
and entertainment company

107
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,930
using Local Zones to deliver low latency,

108
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,370
so to service a new metro

109
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,530
to get closer to those customers.

110
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,780
Similarly, you might see that for gaming.

111
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,580
But it could also be
other regulated industries

112
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,140
that are using Local Zones or Outposts

113
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,820
for data residency requirements.

114
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,210
All that data must be
processed in locale X.

115
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,180
And if you bring an
Outpost into that premise,

116
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,560
into your customer premise

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,830
or it happens to be within
that sovereign boundary,

118
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,450
well, now you've fulfilled
that requirement.

119
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,860
So there's a number of
different use cases.

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,610
It could be latency, it
could be for migration,

121
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,900
it could be for data residency.

122
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,760
There's a number of different use cases.

123
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,950
But let's jump ahead now
that we've defined our terms.

124
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,770
- [Jesus] Yeah, also, if
you're interested in in more

125
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,020
how to deploy agentic
solution on the edge,

126
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,781
after this session will
be another session, 302.

127
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:43,830
It's gonna be around deploying
agentic solution on edge.

128
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,778
- [Robert] You can just come with us.

129
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:45,990
We're supporting the session,

130
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,363
so you can come right along with us.

131
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,850
We'll run on over there.

132
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,090
So again, so we've defined
our terms of the services

133
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,470
that we're gonna be working with today,

134
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,620
Regions, Local Zones, and Outposts.

135
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,688
And we want to talk about resilience.

136
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:02,557
Of course, one of the famous quotes,

137
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:04,830
"Everything fails all the time."

138
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,540
How do we care for resilience?

139
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,450
And we define resilience as
you see here as the ability

140
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,780
of a workload to recover
from infrastructure

141
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,280
or service disruptions.

142
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,290
And you can think about the mental model

143
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,910
for resilience in three different ways.

144
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,010
And again, this has nothing specifically

145
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,100
to do with hybrid and edge
services, it's far broader.

146
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,090
For any region design,

147
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,370
you're gonna think
about high availability,

148
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,370
again, the resistance to common failures

149
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,320
through design for a primary site.

150
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,060
So in the case of hybrid and edge,

151
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,709
what we're gonna show you
and one of the key tenets is

152
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,310
if you're using an AWS
Outpost, it's very likely

153
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,530
that you're gonna wanna
have multiple compute racks

154
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,700
to have high availability.

155
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,250
Similarly, for Local Zones,

156
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,420
let's say you're deploying

157
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,190
in the northeast for a low latency,

158
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,900
you're gonna wanna use two Local Zones,

159
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,040
either in that same city

160
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,959
if they're available or nearby cities too,

161
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,640
just like you would in the region

162
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,990
with two availability zones,

163
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,900
us-east-1a and 1b, for instance.

164
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,690
But then you can also think
about disaster recovery.

165
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,670
So how do you think about backup

166
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,740
and managed recovery objectives?

167
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,690
And we're gonna show you how you can,

168
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,097
'cause there a lot to grasp here.

169
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,793
And each of these concepts
of high availability

170
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:14,520
and disaster recovery have
implications to compute,

171
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,530
and say Amazon EC2 or storage

172
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,366
and RDS databases and beyond, networking.

173
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:24,870
So the cognitive load to
have say one individual,

174
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,707
be an expert in all of
these design primitives

175
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:30,630
for all of the services of AWS,

176
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,840
as it applies to hybrid
and edge, that's a lot.

177
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,900
But what if we could use agentic AI,

178
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,000
and generative AI more broadly,

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,280
to leverage that expertise
and design systems

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,157
that help make prescriptive
recommendations

181
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,530
to create that resiliency.

182
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,480
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

183
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,720
And so if we do a good job today,

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,900
in the spirit of a code talk,

185
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,130
if the code that we purport to
build delivers what we hope,

186
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,410
we hope it covers these areas.

187
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,750
And so we talked about the mental model

188
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,760
of resiliency as a whole.

189
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,710
I tried to define as I
think about resilience

190
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,940
for hybrid and edge environments,

191
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,340
just starting from the say most,

192
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,880
the simplest of primitives
and extracting out from there.

193
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,250
So I would say when I
think about resilience,

194
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,930
we probably wanna start
with site level resilience.

195
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,996
That there's a physical discreet location

196
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:21,150
where that compute rack and an AWS Outpost

197
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,890
or that Local Zone lives,

198
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,256
and I better hope that we
have some geo diversity.

199
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:29,130
I would hope that the
networking is resilient,

200
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,270
that there are different paths

201
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,070
to connect point A to point B

202
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,210
if that transfer is important
to that application workflow.

203
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,310
Compute resilience is
also gonna be important

204
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,190
that if I have, let's just say

205
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,480
a fundamental unit of compute,

206
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,790
if my application requires
three units of compute,

207
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,623
whatever that might be,

208
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,970
an instance type, a load balancer,

209
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,250
well, I better have more
than three units of compute

210
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,140
in that discreet environment.

211
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,640
And of course, you can
extrapolate from there.

212
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,160
So site level resilience,
compute resilience,

213
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,350
network resilience, data is important too.

214
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,850
So when we start, again, start to think

215
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,700
about high availability
and disaster recovery,

216
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,200
well, I want to have data resilience.

217
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,540
So things like clustering, replication,

218
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,460
and then more broadly like
operational resilience.

219
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,020
So not any individual primitive,

220
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,370
but how everything works together

221
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,529
as you start to think about auto scaling,

222
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,750
health checking, monitoring.

223
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,433
So if we do a good job today,

224
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,950
these prescriptive recommendations

225
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,740
for resiliency developed by an AI agent

226
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,240
should be able to come up with

227
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,320
recommendations that match those buckets.

228
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
And here's how we think we're gonna do it.

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,860
And you could of course
implement this differently,

230
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,270
but here is our thought.

231
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,780
Instead of or to compliment the experts

232
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,570
you may already have in
each of those domains,

233
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,144
what if those experts could be

234
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,395
represented as MCP servers?

235
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:48,510
Those MCP servers were then tools

236
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,750
provided to an agent complimented

237
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,400
by the logical reasoning

238
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,340
that an LLM and Amazon Bedrock might have.

239
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,600
It could be an anthropic model,

240
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
it could be an open weights
model, totally up to you,

241
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,600
and there was this agentic loop.

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,946
I will talk about more
that you have a goal

243
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:09,480
and you're gonna keep using
those tools in your tool belt.

244
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,220
So in this case, all the documentation

245
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,170
for best practices that we at AWS have,

246
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,990
plus specific knowledge of
how hybrid and edge works.

247
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,690
So what changes in the world of Outpost

248
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,640
and Local Zones, that we'll talk about.

249
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,640
I gather a bunch of data,
have I achieved that goal?

250
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,473
Yes? No?

251
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:28,080
Oh, not yet, I need more
information to achieve that goal.

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,180
I'll continue that loop
until I'm confident

253
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,760
that I've achieved that user's result.

254
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,690
So if we just quickly go back

255
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,606
to that previous slide for a second,

256
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:39,210
we're gonna use all the
resiliency perimeters

257
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,560
that we talked about before.

258
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,750
So it's not gonna just
operate in isolation here.

259
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,360
It's gonna look specifically
again, the API...

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,807
So it's not just knowledge of,

261
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,240
"Hey, what are general best practices?"

262
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,670
I want know my specific environment,

263
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,720
what's real, what isn't?

264
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,740
How can I make improvements?

265
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,630
So I'm gonna use an MCP
server that talks to my AWS,

266
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,630
various AWS APIs to liaise with VPC, EC2,

267
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,520
EBS, auto-scaling, and the list goes on

268
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,280
because now I can look
at my entire environment,

269
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,580
reconcile it with what
those best practices exist

270
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,460
and suggest tailored
recommendations to me.

271
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,991
So let's jump ahead, we're
gonna start talking about

272
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,677
what we are gonna build here today

273
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:22,920
from static to something more advanced.

274
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,850
Jesus, you wanna talk a little bit more-

275
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,930
- Sure.
- About what this looks like?

276
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,320
- [Jesus] Sure, so basically,
our idea is to start

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,510
with some configuration static file.

278
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,810
Normally, how we would do this before,

279
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,680
it's just gather information
around our environment,

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,210
see the resources that we have

281
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,430
in terms of locals on Outposts,

282
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,399
and then create a kind of first report.

283
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,190
It says like kind of static report,

284
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,277
if you think around having
all the resources and say,

285
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,720
"Hey, now I need to build

286
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:56,520
a best practice for my infrastructure."

287
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,830
Then, you are gonna put some NCP servers,

288
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,460
some tools to ultimately request

289
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,320
and fetch all these resources.

290
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,140
And based on the knowledge of the AWS,

291
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,970
the MCP documentation part,

292
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,350
we combine that to create a new report

293
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,966
that is more comprehensive, right?

294
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,440
And we'll be iterating of the agent

295
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
that we are gonna be building.

296
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,770
We are gonna be using Strands Agents.

297
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,330
For those doesn't know Strands,

298
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,760
we will talk a little bit around it

299
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,440
and we will talk around several

300
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,200
how we can use multi-pattern strategy

301
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,450
with the Strands using, for example,

302
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,280
Agent as Tool, or Swarm, or workflows.

303
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,040
So our goal today, again,

304
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,900
this is a kind of a high-level step,

305
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,400
we're gonna be creating a static
Python file for Discovery.

306
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,010
Then, we're gonna be creating a report

307
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,422
based on this information.

308
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:54,570
Then, using Kiro CLI,

309
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,330
we're gonna be integrating some MCPs.

310
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,090
The first one is a tool to get information

311
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,800
around the resources automatically,

312
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,250
also be using MCP to get
all the documentation

313
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,370
of AWS best practice around resilience.

314
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,510
And we will be switching this

315
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:16,933
from Kiro CLI that is
prompting into a Strands Agent,

316
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,560
and we'll be building a
couple of Strands Agent.

317
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,120
- [Robert] And maybe quickly,
just a show of hands,

318
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,350
how many of you over the course

319
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,330
of the week have had a
chance either to be hands-on

320
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,353
or attend a session
covering Strands or Kiro?

321
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,040
Okay, so good, good, that I was expecting.

322
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,930
So we're maybe at 60, 70% of the room.

323
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,730
So lucky for you, today we're going

324
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,710
to apply all of those
concepts that you started

325
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,230
to see specifically to this hybrid

326
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,310
and edge track of how you...

327
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,810
It's not just, so there
are gonna be plenty

328
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,250
of other sessions that show you,

329
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,740
hey, on a Outpost or Local Zone,

330
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,740
those same telecommunications
or media entertainment,

331
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,430
or gaming companies may be
running generative AI models

332
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,310
at the edge for latency
or data residency reasons.

333
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,810
We're flipping that
model on its head today

334
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,450
and saying, okay, what
you could also do is,

335
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,010
for your own edifice, use
generative AI tools in the cloud

336
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,035
to inform how you use those hybrid

337
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,650
and edge infrastructure
services in the first place.

338
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,483
- Let's move on.
- Let's do it.

339
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:14,310
- [Jesus] So first, let's
talk about a little bit

340
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,544
around our environment.

341
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,300
Again, we're gonna be using Outposts,

342
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,920
we are using a specific account.

343
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,290
It has five Outposts,
four of them are active,

344
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,580
one is in provisioning.

345
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,770
We'll be running this
in the Frankfurt region

346
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,450
where we have all the resources.

347
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,397
The first thing that we are
gonna be using is Kiro CLI.

348
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:33,090
This Kiro CLI implements behind the scenes

349
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,820
what we see as the agentic loop, alright?

350
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,290
It has the capacity of reason,

351
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,720
it has the capacity to
connect to the resources.

352
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,900
But the first thing that we're
gonna be using is Kiro CLI

353
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,750
to create this kind of a
static files, the reports,

354
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,558
and then move forward to
create the Strands Agent.

355
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:52,560
So for those that used to...

356
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,983
How many of you used before
Q CLI, Q Developer CLI?

357
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,530
Alright, Kiro CLI is
basically the evolution.

358
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,580
It's the integration of Q Developer CLI,

359
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,890
now it's Kiro CLI and it's part

360
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,590
of integrating of
agentic development tool.

361
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,153
So let's move into our
first step, let me see,

362
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,437
of let's create something here.

363
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,093
Can you switch the-
- Yep.

364
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,140
Demo.

365
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,620
- [Jesus] Yeah, so hopefully
we are using internet,

366
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,300
it doesn't fail, so let's
start talking with Kiro CLI.

367
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,133
- [Robert] And can everyone see?

368
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:35,310
Is the screen large enough?

369
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,210
We get, okay, great.

370
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,510
- [Jesus] Alright, for those
that haven't used this before,

371
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,690
here we are using an
agent that is default.

372
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,050
What we're seeing here is how
the context is being used.

373
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,320
So we can check more
here around the contents.

374
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,160
Basically, it has 3% of
being of some of the tools.

375
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,650
If you want to see the
tools that it has already,

376
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,720
it has, for example, one tool

377
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,570
that is called AWS1 is
the thinking report,

378
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,460
write/read files, and so on.

379
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,570
So those tools already consume
part of our content's window

380
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,247
because it's available
directly in the Kiro CLI.

381
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,910
I have some prompts here,

382
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,690
so, sorry, just to show you.

383
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,450
So I'm gonna be saying that,
"I'm presenting at re:Invent,

384
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm showing live how Kiro CLI works,

385
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,270
and for all my requests,
save all the generated assets

386
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,800
and scripts to," a specific folder.

387
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,750
So it knows where to do the file,

388
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,760
so we have some kind of consistence.

389
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,070
Again, we're gonna be
using on a specific account

390
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,430
that has some of the Outposts
that we already mentioned.

391
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,413
So this is the profile that we have.

392
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,780
So here, now Kiro CLI

393
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,420
is validating and creating the folder.

394
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,260
It's already there.

395
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,260
So I'm ready to set up all the demos.

396
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,930
What are the first thing
that you want to build?

397
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,510
So as we explain, let's move forward

398
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,700
and create a static file.

399
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,820
I have my prompt here, so let's see.

400
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,310
So I'm gonna be creating a Python file

401
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,700
that is called
edge_discovery, that use boto3

402
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,210
the SDK library for Python,

403
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,340
to discover all the edge resources

404
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,390
in this particular region.

405
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,190
And the script must contain

406
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,310
and discover things
like Availability Zone,

407
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,050
Local Zone, Outputs.

408
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,180
I want to see which are the instance types

409
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,860
available on some of the Outposts.

410
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,800
And the script itself needs
to manage all this information

411
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,827
around error handling (indistinct)

412
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:30,418
and I want this and output as a JSON file.

413
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:31,251
- [Robert] Right.

414
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,360
- [Jesus] So let's start doing this

415
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,770
and let's analyze what it creates

416
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,840
so we can dive deeply a little bit.

417
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,460
- [Robert] And key point
to think about right now,

418
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,230
this is the v1.

419
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,400
So if we're gonna think about, again,

420
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,800
resiliency and reliability in
a hybrid and edge environment,

421
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,320
step one, even before we
think about creating an agent,

422
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,070
yes, we're using an
agentic CLI tool to do so,

423
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,420
but we're just trying to take inventory of

424
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,630
what exists before we create
prescriptive recommendations.

425
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,030
And so that's exactly what
you're gonna see here.

426
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,931
- [Jesus] So it already create my file.

427
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,642
Let's check the file.

428
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:03,570
First, let's try to run it.

429
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,660
If something happened, it
can automatically fix it,

430
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,160
but let's see if it runs,

431
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,450
and we can dive deep a little bit

432
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,463
of the code that we generated, alright?

433
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,290
Alright, so let's see while it's running.

434
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,980
So we set to create a
file that is a static,

435
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,750
it discovered the edge infrastructure.

436
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,370
Basically, if we dive deep a little bit

437
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,900
on the function it created,

438
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,660
it go to boto3 using the profile

439
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,278
that we set on the region and it creates

440
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,520
and it fetched all the information

441
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,350
around the Availability Zone.

442
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,680
It have all the information
around the zone ID, state,

443
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,410
if it's Local Zone, whether it's...

444
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,300
Where's the parent AC or the network

445
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,860
border group that is attached.

446
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,840
For the Outposts, it's
doing basically the same.

447
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,973
It's listing is boto3,

448
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,140
SDK functions to list the Outposts

449
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,240
and basically it's getting the information

450
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,410
around the Availability Zones,

451
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,870
the instance type available, and so on.

452
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,380
Also, we want to see from
the Outposts perspective,

453
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,410
there is a content around
that is called slotting.

454
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,750
So the Outpost itself is a max service,

455
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,660
is a hardware that a 42U hardware

456
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,670
that you have compute nodes

457
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,010
and you need to specify
what are the shapings

458
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,817
or the type of EC2 instance
that you want to load

459
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:23,670
and have available on that configuration.

460
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,220
So we want to see, in this
particular post that we have,

461
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,320
what are the instance types available

462
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,690
and also if we have some placement group,

463
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,400
what are the placement group that we have,

464
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,740
and let's see the results.

465
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,379
So it run, alright.

466
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,470
This is the information that we got.

467
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,870
Alright, let's dive deep
a little bit on this.

468
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,210
It's basically saying the
region, the Availability Zones,

469
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,680
and all the information that we just check

470
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,540
in the Python script.

471
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,550
Now let's move forward and say that I want

472
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,030
to modify this script, I want this script

473
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,880
to be stored in a JSON file.

474
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,430
Alright, it's gonna be
a simple modification.

475
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,000
Basically, we expect
in that it will change

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,430
a little bit the last part, alright?

477
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,670
So now the output will be safe here

478
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,010
in the edge_discovery, that JSON file.

479
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,060
And if we run this, it
will generate my file,

480
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,510
my JSON file with the
information we already saw.

481
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,183
- [Robert] While it's generating,

482
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:26,040
any questions about what we're doing,

483
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,870
why we're doing it, and
sort of the sequencing here?

484
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,900
Again, this is just the, we're
creating a static snapshot,

485
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,320
a point-in-time view of just,
"Hey, what's out there?"

486
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,640
Once we have that, of course,

487
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,200
then we'll be able to
create recommendations.

488
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,590
And one very key insight,
especially for those

489
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,500
who are seeing Outposts and
Local Zones for the first time,

490
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,470
these are connected edge offerings.

491
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,610
The Local Zone in a given metro

492
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,750
or an Outpost sitting
in your customer premise

493
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,360
always has a parent region.

494
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,360
It's connected to an
Availability Zone in the region.

495
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,280
That creates of course high availability

496
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,930
but it creates that connectedness

497
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,930
that allows you to run API operations.

498
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,300
And why that's important is you see

499
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,940
how all those Outposts has
an anchor Availability Zone,

500
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,910
every Local Zone is anchored to a region.

501
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,260
You're starting to see
how that's gonna create

502
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,790
high availability best practices.

503
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,710
You're gonna want Outposts anchored

504
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,910
to different Availability Zones.

505
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,437
You're gonna wanna have Local Zones

506
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:25,425
with different availability Zone IDs.

507
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,245
So those same best
practices continue to apply.

508
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:30,240
- [Jesus] Let's ask even
Kiro CLI to create a,

509
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,740
based on the information we have,

510
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,540
let's create a first static report.

511
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,507
Basically, we are saying like,

512
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,330
"Create an HTML report based

513
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,070
on AWS best practice for the edge

514
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,830
and considering the resources
that we already discovered."

515
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,350
- [Robert] We haven't told Kiro CLI

516
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,340
what those best practices are.

517
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,540
So it's gotta figure it out.

518
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,820
- [Jesus] Yeah, it will
be using the knowledge

519
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,300
that it was until that
model that it's using,

520
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,700
that is auto model, and
we'll dive deep a little bit

521
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,280
on more on that, but it's
using the knowledge base

522
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,580
that the model itself have
onto the cut point time

523
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,570
that it was trained.

524
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,410
- [Robert] Right.

525
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,170
- [Jesus] Alright, so if we want to use,

526
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,880
and we will be using like,

527
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,040
if want to use the
up-to-date documentation,

528
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,380
the latest documentation,
we need to find a way

529
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,640
to fetch that documentation

530
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,200
and we'll be using an MCP tool

531
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,240
that provide access to the best practice

532
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,923
using AWS MCP documentation,
alright, for this one.

533
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,253
Any questions so far?

534
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,750
- [Audience Member] About
the MCP documentation,

535
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,750
(indistinct) automatically or-

536
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,354
- [Jesus] No, we'll be showing this-

537
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,960
- [Robert] Not yet, right
now it's just the knowledge

538
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,550
that this large language model

539
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,400
that's being used by default
by Kiro natively knows.

540
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,530
And the only reason it knows
anything about your environment

541
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,650
is we specifically say,
"Hey, edge_discovery.json,"

542
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,840
which we happen to know captured

543
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
that point of time snapshot.

544
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,780
- [Jesus] Alright.

545
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,610
- So trying to do this-
- Here we got,

546
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,579
we have our first, this is just generated.

547
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,530
- Completely live-
- We're seeing-

548
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,520
- [Robert] We're seeing
it for the first time.

549
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,030
- [Jesus] For the first time as you.

550
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,260
So we have here our information

551
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,470
where our three Availability
Zones in the us-central-1.

552
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,820
We have two Local Zones enabled,

553
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,130
we have three Wavelength Zones
and we have five Outposts.

554
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,920
Four of them are active, one
is in provisioning state.

555
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,830
And we have here all the details
of the Availability Zone,

556
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,780
the Local Zone, and the Outpost.

557
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,993
If you see the Outpost itself,
(indistinct) mentioned,

558
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:22,260
is tied to a parent AC

559
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,780
because when we request the Outposts,

560
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,220
we do something that is
called the anchor BPC

561
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,200
and we create a subnet in specific AC

562
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,340
that we want to put the control
plane go through that AC.

563
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,710
So we have here four Outposts,

564
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,770
one of the two of them in the 1a,

565
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,300
the one that is provisioning is not,

566
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,530
it doesn't have information yet,

567
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,850
and the other one that are spanning

568
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,460
across the rest of the AC.

569
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,560
If we see the best practice documentation,

570
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,490
it show a really comprehensive information

571
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,710
like your infrastructure
span in the three AC

572
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,690
with Outpost in each zone,

573
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,090
providing excellent
geographic distribution.

574
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,830
There are some recommendations around,

575
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,170
there is an Outpost that
is in provisioning status,

576
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,760
check what's going on.

577
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,240
And we have multiple of
instance type available

578
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,470
in terms of diversity.

579
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,200
We have several offers
around instance type

580
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,120
in terms of the Outpost Rack 1.

581
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,310
We have C5, M5, R5,

582
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,910
and we can also have different types here.

583
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,910
So again, this is kind
of static information.

584
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,377
We just generated the script

585
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:31,260
and now we're providing some information.

586
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,093
Any question?

587
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,530
- [Audience Member] This is
all one AWS account, right?

588
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,363
- Yes.
- Yeah.

589
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,835
- [Audience Member] What
if you wanna like try

590
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,460
to have multiple AWS accounts?

591
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,530
- [Jesus] Yeah, you can ask Kiro, say,

592
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,560
you can use, for example, if
you are using AWS Organization

593
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,480
and you have cross-role,
you can say, "Hey,"

594
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,070
for example, if you're using control tower

595
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,717
and you have a cross-role
across many, you can say,

596
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:59,900
"Hey, use this, verify
what are my accounts."

597
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,730
It can discover your
account and assume the role

598
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,610
to perform this information
across all your environment

599
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,140
spanning in multiple accounts.
- Right.

600
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,390
- [Audience Member] Would
you need to (indistinct)

601
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,838
when you use Kiro CLI,

602
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:14,280
like, how do you
authenticate the (indistinct)

603
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,500
- [Jesus] Yeah, I have here my profile.

604
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,890
So in the profile itself in
the AWS CLI configuration,

605
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,740
it has the information
around the account ID

606
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,719
and the profile of that
role that I'm assuming.

607
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:28,296
- [Audience Member]
Right, what I mean is...

608
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:31,948
I'm using Kiro CLI, so (indistinct)

609
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:35,948
know exactly how that
works, but every time I...

610
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,500
When I use it for the first time,

611
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,700
you know, I don't want
a profile giving a code

612
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,495
for the given database account,

613
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:46,647
so that I can-
- Right.

614
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,810
- [Audience Member] If
there are multiple accounts,

615
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,210
would you need to
(indistinct) every single one,

616
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:55,950
or just for the-
- Those are decoupled,

617
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,810
like one account is what
you would have access,

618
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,340
would give you access to Kiro.

619
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,500
But those other accounts could
simply be to pull resources.

620
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,290
So the simplest brute force way is

621
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,380
however you've authenticated
to have access to Kiro,

622
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,760
that remains unchanged.

623
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,640
But you could have your

624
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,980
AWS configuration file

625
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,280
where you typically have
your account secrets

626
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,630
and you could have multiple profiles.

627
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,170
And then in that, and
when you prompt Kiro CLI,

628
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,344
you can basically say, remember we created

629
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:24,810
that edge_discovery.json file?

630
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,920
We can basically say, "Hey,

631
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,300
iterate through all of
those AWS profiles."

632
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,290
And then given those credentials,

633
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,880
you're now talking to different accounts

634
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,104
of different resources, pull from there,

635
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:38,035
and now you have a more complete set

636
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,690
of resources reflecting that JSON.

637
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,760
Now, how you segment by account,

638
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,856
you would have to decide
what's important to you.

639
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:44,689
- Yeah, yeah,
- Yeah.

640
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:45,990
- [Jesus] Alright, so let's move forward.

641
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,480
Again, here we are not using the tools.

642
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,420
The tool itself is what keto CLI

643
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,180
has entered as default.

644
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,070
It has like to do, thinking.

645
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,820
You can enable some of these
tools in the experimental part.

646
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,370
So you see here, I have like to-do list,

647
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,770
checkpoint, delegate, knowledge, thinking.

648
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,620
This is our part of the Kiro CLI part.

649
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,440
But now I want to introduce
a new MCP, alright?

650
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,620
So let's create a new agent.

651
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,650
Let's create, it's called agent 3.

652
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,263
So here it's the
configuration of the agent.

653
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:23,750
Think around this, it's
like you can have multiple

654
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,940
Kiro CLI instances at the same time.

655
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,230
Think around like profiling.

656
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,080
So you can have one agent that has access

657
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,360
to different tools, different MCP.

658
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,320
In this particular case,

659
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm gonna be adding
this knowledge base MCP.

660
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,750
So hopefully it works.

661
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,060
So we have a, this is
a public documentation.

662
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,260
We will be sharing a little bit of

663
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,150
what all the AWS MCP we have
out there so you can consume.

664
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,790
This particular MCP is an MCP

665
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,280
that provides information
around best practice,

666
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,420
latest documentation, dynamically, right?

667
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,500
So now we have created,
let's change the contents

668
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,760
and then say I'm gonna
be using this agent.

669
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,620
So if you see right now,

670
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,310
and I go my tool, now have new MCP here,

671
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,290
that it's aws-knowledge-mcp-server

672
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:20,790
that have this kind of information
and this kind of tools.

673
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,710
So what if we, instead of
saying create a static file,

674
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,050
let's make something different.

675
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,170
Let's say that I want to create

676
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,200
a HTML report of edge
resilience best practice

677
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,760
for my infrastructure,

678
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,970
but I want you to find
the latest documentation

679
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,860
and using the AWS tool that it has,

680
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,693
find the resources for me, I don't-

681
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,560
- [Robert] There's no JSON file anymore.

682
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,197
- Yeah, you are not relying-
- We're clean-slate.

683
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,730
- [Jesus] On anything, on any static file.

684
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,630
It needs to somehow with
the agentic loop figure out

685
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,760
what are the resources
that it needs to find based

686
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
on the best practice documentation

687
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,660
and it create a report for me.

688
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,493
- [Robert] While the report is creating,

689
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:05,580
can we take a question from the audience?

690
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,870
- [Jesus] Yeah, sure.

691
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,770
- [Audience Member] What's the difference

692
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,040
between the knowledge
MCP server you just added

693
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,950
and the knowledge tool
that's already added and why?

694
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,640
Are they different from each?

695
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,860
- [Jesus] Yeah, this one?

696
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,300
- [Audience Member] Yeah,
so I see knowledge there,

697
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,920
and I saw you got knowledge,
a second knowledge.

698
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,590
Just curious what the difference is.

699
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,613
- [Jesus] Yeah, I'm not sure,
yeah, I'll take that offline.

700
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,770
Kiro was rebranded like one week ago.

701
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,230
It used to be QCLI,

702
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,972
so it introduced new features

703
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,980
like web search and web fetch,

704
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,740
which wasn't before on QCLI directly.

705
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,650
So you can dive deep a
little bit, I don't know if-

706
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,610
- [Robert] Generally speaking,

707
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,680
the idea would be that
it's the general knowledge

708
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,160
that the Kiro CLI must have
for just coding in general

709
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,630
and any best practices for software,

710
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,350
whereas the more specific
guidance you can give, the better.

711
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,490
And so we've created, you know,

712
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,320
to keep update documentation

713
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,880
to have a specific AWS knowledge.

714
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,826
But it's likely to your point
that there is some overlap.

715
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:09,706
- [Audience Member] Okay.

716
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,916
- [Jesus] Yeah, so if
we see, ah, go ahead.

717
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,138
- One last question.
- Yeah.

718
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:15,145
- [Audience Member]
Focused on his question.

719
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:17,585
So the built-in knowledge,

720
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:20,668
is it basically using an MCP

721
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:24,183
default (indistinct) something like that?

722
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:26,760
- [Robert] Right, 'cause those
are all tools that it has.

723
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,140
And so it may not be MCP.

724
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,220
- Okay.
- Right?

725
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,204
So as you'll see later when
you create a Strands Agent,

726
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:33,180
you can just have local tools

727
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,380
that you'll see with like a Decker.

728
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,550
You have just some function

729
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,120
like def cool function and
then it just has some logic.

730
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,190
It need not be called through MCP.

731
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,028
That's just one way for
a protocol for different,

732
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:45,660
for an agent to talk to a tool.

733
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,620
So in that case, it may not
be called via MCP itself.

734
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,220
- [Jesus] So if we see what
is happening behind the scene,

735
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,230
when I ask this kind of request,

736
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,490
it's gonna be running the tool

737
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,817
to search the documentation like,

738
00:29:57,817 --> 00:30:00,367
"Resilient best practice
for availability zones,"

739
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:01,987
"Outputs and failover best practice,"

740
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:05,490
"Local Zones architecture,
"Best practice," and so on.

741
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,670
And think around it's
getting all this information

742
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,110
and putting in the context

743
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,037
and now it needs to find
all the resources that,

744
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:16,020
because I want this
applied for my account,

745
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,900
it will find all the
resources using the profile,

746
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,960
it will run the CLI using this tool

747
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,160
to get all this information

748
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,703
and create the HTML file for us.

749
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,130
It's gonna take a while.

750
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,080
Let's go back into the presentation

751
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,010
to get some of the next
thing that we're doing

752
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,270
and we can talk a little bit

753
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,273
of the MCP servers we have there.

754
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,150
Meanwhile, and we go back to the...

755
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,360
So talking a little bit
of some of the MCPs,

756
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,503
we add this MCP,

757
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,270
which is the knowledge MCP server.

758
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,870
But there are other MCP
servers that you can use.

759
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,520
For example, in this particular case,

760
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,247
we didn't add because it was
built-in in the Kiro CLI,

761
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,360
but you can use Cloud
Control API MCP Server

762
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,640
to have access to all the resources

763
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,007
around your AWS infrastructure.

764
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,260
You basically have information around

765
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,690
how to access with API

766
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,410
and integrate with your environment.

767
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,610
In this particular case,

768
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:30,900
we didn't use it because
it has already tool

769
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,370
that is AWS tool to get that information.

770
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,213
Any question?

771
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,920
Alright, so...

772
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,230
So we won't reiterate this.

773
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,810
Let's talk a little bit around strengths

774
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,300
while it generates it,
it hasn't finished yet.

775
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,260
So we can talk a little
bit around how we...

776
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,260
Now we want to move out from...

777
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,650
We create this kind of
assessment and report,

778
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,660
but it was kind of interactive, right?

779
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,850
Like, we need to dive deep

780
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,580
and type what we have
in a prompting style.

781
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,860
What if we want to run a kind of agent

782
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,590
and we want to build an agent
using Python that can run,

783
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,120
for example, in my backend system,

784
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,270
I can execute and can
run every time I need

785
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,640
instead of having something

786
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,190
that I need to prompt manually.

787
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,140
We can create something
using a Python file

788
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,140
and an agent that can run in the backend.

789
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,010
So that's why we're gonna
be using Strands Agent.

790
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:41,010
Strands Agents are open source
SDK for building agents.

791
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:46,851
And you can use a Strands with
multiple online providers.

792
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,500
In this case, we're
gonna be using Bedrock,

793
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,257
but you can use a other provider

794
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:55,050
and it has a set of tools
that you can integrate,

795
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,363
use, and make it.

796
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,760
Wanna mention something?

797
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,050
- [Robert] Sure, maybe just to,

798
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,780
as we'll see in the code,
maybe just a few things.

799
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,850
When you think about an agent,

800
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,100
it's gotta have a model,
it's gotta have a prompt.

801
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,550
So the brain of how it's
able to logically reason,

802
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,960
the prompt to tell it what it's doing,

803
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
and then a series of tools,

804
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,990
the actions it can take to
deliver against that goal.

805
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,430
And we believe that with Strands,

806
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,990
it's one of the easiest ways,

807
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,390
specifically native to
AWS, to marry those three,

808
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,300
almost like Strands of
DNA that are intertwined.

809
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,370
And so the ability just to have like

810
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,920
a really, really simple
way you can create agents

811
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,730
in just a very few lines of code,

812
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,020
but also native integrations.

813
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,510
If you wanted to have a RAG
workflow as part of your tools,

814
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,330
so company-specific data,
you had a specific question

815
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,470
and you had that RAG workflow

816
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,450
and you wanted to expose it as a tool,

817
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,940
you could write a bunch of
extra code to do that manually

818
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,520
or you could just use the
native retrieve library

819
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,980
that's already integrated
with Bedrock knowledge basis.

820
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,940
So that's an example of where
the AWS integration shines

821
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,440
with something like Strands.

822
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,270
- [Jesus] So on the other hand,

823
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,733
now we're gonna be switching to use Kiro.

824
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,727
The IDE is our agentic development

825
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,770
platform for prototyping.

826
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,500
In this particular case,
we were using Kiro CLI.

827
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,900
Now we're gonna be using the IDE

828
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,260
for create our first agent.

829
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,700
And let's move on.

830
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Let's see if we should have...

831
00:34:16,748 --> 00:34:18,273
- [Robert] The report.

832
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:19,873
- [Jesus] The report ready.

833
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:23,703
Okay, it create the new report

834
00:34:23,703 --> 00:34:26,520
and generate this report.

835
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,670
We can see that it have
similar information,

836
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,040
three Availability Zones, two Local Zones,

837
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,100
four or five output, one of
them is in provisioning state.

838
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,170
But it has also more
information around, for example,

839
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,993
auto scaling group, load
balancer, placement groups.

840
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,860
It has information also
around multiple deployments

841
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,910
of information of EC2
instance infrastructure

842
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,300
that expands across

843
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,750
other load balancer, for example,

844
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,700
that we didn't have before.

845
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,371
So in this particular case, again,

846
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,960
when we create this,

847
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,530
we didn't ask any specific resources

848
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,930
to be like static generated,

849
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,670
or we didn't find statically,

850
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,680
it just find it for us.

851
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,080
It basically discovered
this placement group,

852
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,700
Local Zones and all this stuff.

853
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,640
So it generate this for us
based on the documentation

854
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,043
that it finds and it creates the report.

855
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,560
So let's move into Kiro.

856
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,360
This is the development environment.

857
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,553
Again, we're gonna be using Vibe coding.

858
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,493
This is a code talk.

859
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,790
Let's hopefully it work.

860
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,790
So let's just start with Kiro
asking something around...

861
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,020
Read the documentation of Strands,

862
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,030
and based on the documentation of Strands,

863
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,560
create our first agent.

864
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,660
So in order to read the
documentation of Strands,

865
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,430
we can use an Strands MCP documentation

866
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:06,550
for showing that

867
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,790
we have this Strands documentation.

868
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,860
Let's figure out, let's create

869
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,463
our Strands documentation agent.

870
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,370
Alright, so we can use, for example,

871
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,850
this agent that is called
a Strands MCP agent,

872
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,040
basically, it run uvx comment.

873
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,640
But in our particular
case, you can also use,

874
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,280
for example, you can
retrieve the documentation

875
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,420
of the software that you are building.

876
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,690
Ask the Kiro environment
to read the documentation

877
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,580
if you don't have an MCP server for that,

878
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,200
and based on the documentation,

879
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,160
start building on top of that.

880
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,320
- [Robert] And key point that I think

881
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,590
you'll see here is the
configuration of this agent,

882
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,930
whether it's the Kiro IDE or the Kiro CLI,

883
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,950
was almost identical.

884
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,936
And you'll notice when you
specify those MCP servers,

885
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:59,250
the first time when we were looking

886
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,010
at the aws-knowledge-mcp-server,

887
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,850
it was more of a URL

888
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,730
because it was a remote MCP server.

889
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,750
In this case when we were showing Strands,

890
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,250
it was a local MCP server.

891
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,303
So it's the consistency of
defining the MCP services

892
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:17,040
or rather to define these
MCP servers, is consistent,

893
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,300
but it could be local, it could be remote,

894
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,950
it could be a combination
of both, it doesn't matter.

895
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,440
- [Jesus] So in order to do that,

896
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,680
again, I downloaded the
documentation of Strands, right?

897
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,380
So I'm asking to read the documentation.

898
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,920
Also, I create a based template
of a simple Strands agent.

899
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,501
So it has all the information
around my profile.

900
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:38,167
I could use even Kiro
to say, "Hey," you know,

901
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,740
"create a agent using this profile,"

902
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,170
in order to avoid kind of kind of noise.

903
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,060
Or we have a short time,

904
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,610
I want to be focused on what we have today

905
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,710
and focus on our configuration.

906
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,150
So I create a kind of base agent

907
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,312
that it says I'm gonna
be using this profile,

908
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:59,312
I'm gonna be using a
structural response in Strands.

909
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,160
That means, for example,
if you want the output

910
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,120
of your agent to be structure,

911
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,800
let's suppose that you are
returning a person object.

912
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,530
You want to have a name, you
have to want to have the age.

913
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,590
So you can create a kind of,
when you create the agent,

914
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,990
you say, "Hey, use a static output."

915
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,110
In this particular, I'm
gonna say I'm gonna be asking

916
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,210
for a markdown report.

917
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,733
So, and these are just placeholder, right?

918
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,510
These are our main loop and
we are gonna be creating,

919
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,560
using ours profile, I'm gonna
be creating a runtime client

920
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,640
for Bedrock with 300 seconds,

921
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,730
300 seconds to create the client.

922
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,890
Then, I'm gonna be
creating the agent itself

923
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,290
and asking the agent for something.

924
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,123
There's a place-

925
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:47,956
- [Robert] That's the most important part.

926
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:49,650
Quickly, folks, if this
is your first time dealing

927
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,750
with Strands, what, four lines of code?

928
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,020
Really three, if you exclude
the closing parentheses.

929
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,940
When we say you can define an agent

930
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,250
in three lines of code,
that's what we mean.

931
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,260
You see the system
prompt, you see the model,

932
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,080
you see the agent
instantiation, and that's it.

933
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,687
- [Jesus] That's it.

934
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:08,130
So I'm gonna be asking to,

935
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,470
using the Strands
documentation from this folder,

936
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,000
create an agent with a Strands
name of v1, using this base.

937
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,030
And basically, the
script should be running

938
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,890
using this model, the 300 second
is there for read timeout.

939
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,310
And also, we are gonna be
using some tools similar

940
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,110
to the static file that we created

941
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,610
to create some information
around get_outposts,

942
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,070
get_local_zone, Availability
Zone, and so on.

943
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,520
So behind the scenes,
it's gonna be creating

944
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,250
several functions to get information,

945
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,900
similar to the Python file

946
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,640
that we created at the beginning.

947
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,003
So let's go and ask
Kiro to do that for us.

948
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,420
Meanwhile, this create the file.

949
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,160
Alright, it's reading the documentation.

950
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,980
I have a backup here, we
can show how it's gonna be,

951
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,270
the code that it's gonna be generating.

952
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,790
I'm only leaving this generating the code,

953
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:00,813
but we can start reading
how the code will look like.

954
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,313
Shall we do that?
- Let's go.

955
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,230
- [Jesus] So now it's
doing, right, but let's see,

956
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,410
in order to get some of the time, so-

957
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,243
- [Robert] And let's go back to the,

958
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:15,690
I think let's start with
the agent instantiation,

959
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,210
show what's the same, and then let's show

960
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,560
what's different, what the agent did.

961
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,060
So we should still see-
- Yeah.

962
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,990
- [Robert] Somewhere in
the middle of the file,

963
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,370
it instantiated the agent
just like it did before, but-

964
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,280
- [Jesus] Yeah, let's
go to the agent part,

965
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,836
where we define the agent.

966
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:31,860
So we have our main part
where we have our config,

967
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,890
our Bedrock client, the model itself,

968
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,660
and now we are creating an agent.

969
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,067
And we are saying that
you have some tools.

970
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:41,700
Which tools are this?

971
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,657
Basically, we ask to create
some kind of functions

972
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:48,960
where it can fetch information
around Outpost, Local Zones,

973
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,620
Availability Zone, EC2 RDS you mentioned.

974
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,210
So in this particular case,

975
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,680
we are creating this agent

976
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,677
and the system prompt for the
agent, it's basically this.

977
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:03,007
"You are an AWS edge
infrastructure resilient expert

978
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,047
"and your role is to analyze
the AWS infrastructure

979
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:08,317
"deployment and provide
comprehensive resilience assessment.

980
00:41:08,317 --> 00:41:09,960
"And your analysis should cover,"

981
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,840
and there is a lot of points
that it needs to cover.

982
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,420
This is being generated
right now, right away.

983
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,390
But I have a backup
here just to show this.

984
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,390
So when we create this,

985
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,980
we ask to create a kind of tools,

986
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,100
alright, like a EC2 instance, which are...

987
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,950
Now it's running.

988
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,210
Meanwhile it's running,
I'll be showing this.

989
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:37,890
So if you want to see the
tools that we created,

990
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,480
we ask to create like get_outposts.

991
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,090
So it's using boto3, the client,

992
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,080
to list the Outpost and
list all the resources,

993
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,910
pretty similar to the Python file

994
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,130
that we created at the beginning.

995
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,910
So after it run, it's running right now.

996
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,550
So it just created the new one.

997
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,683
Let's see the, not the backup,

998
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,830
let's see the one that
it actually created,

999
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,243
should be pretty similar,

1000
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,150
which is running right now.

1001
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,530
So it's conducting a
comprehensive AWS structure

1002
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,740
resilience analysis on
the us-central-1 region,

1003
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,700
and it's calling the tools.

1004
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,590
It calling get_outposts, get_local_zones,

1005
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,947
get_availability_zones,
instance, other stuff,

1006
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:22,380
and now it's basically outputting.

1007
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,910
It's creating my output.

1008
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,985
This is the report that is gonna be saving

1009
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:29,610
one second after it finish with my MD

1010
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,250
with all the information that I have.

1011
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,423
Any questions so far?

1012
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:38,040
- [Robert] And I think just
a key learning objective is

1013
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,380
no surprise that the individual tools

1014
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,574
that are being instantiated,
like get_outposts,

1015
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:44,850
is gonna be using almost identical code

1016
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,260
to that first program we created

1017
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,770
that describes the EC2
instances that are available

1018
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,630
or describes the Availability Zones,

1019
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,220
the Local Zones, and the Outposts

1020
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,380
that are available
anchored to that region.

1021
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,150
So it's just we're taking
these little primitives,

1022
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,440
these functions and showing

1023
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,221
it can be standalone Python file,

1024
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:03,960
it can be part of a tool
that talks to an agent.

1025
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,930
It can be embedded into
some remote MCP server

1026
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,200
that our CLI or agent talks to.

1027
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,760
It's just different ways

1028
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,180
of using the generative AI toolkit in AWS

1029
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,440
to get the results you need

1030
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,560
and often much faster
than doing so manually.

1031
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,760
- [Jesus] So now it's basically

1032
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,940
the output of all the
information that it's providing.

1033
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,910
Once it finish, it should generate a file

1034
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,483
with a MD that as we ask, like the v1.

1035
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,260
And I think it should be finishing

1036
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,053
in a couple of seconds,
hopefully it works.

1037
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:44,790
After this, we're gonna
be doing something similar

1038
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,380
to what we did with Kiro CLI.

1039
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,500
What if we say, "Hey, just
remove all these tools

1040
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,090
and let's use a tool

1041
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,220
that can provide access
to my environment,"

1042
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,900
I don't want to define any kind of tool,

1043
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,780
and simplify my agent saying,
"Now you are an expert.

1044
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,150
You have access to my AWS infrastructure.

1045
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,910
You have access to the
AWS documentation, do it."

1046
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,190
What I need is gonna
be simplifying our code

1047
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,600
of a Strands agent in less than 100 lines.

1048
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,573
So, great.

1049
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,963
Any questions so far?

1050
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,140
- [Audience Member] I have a question.

1051
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,710
But in terms of cost, how many
credited costs this exercise?

1052
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,780
- [Jesus] Yeah, so when
you are running Strands,

1053
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,180
you can use the metrics tool.

1054
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,460
So it generates how many input tokens

1055
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,590
and output tokens it's consuming.

1056
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,783
- [Audience Member] So for example,

1057
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,211
your particular exercise is one.

1058
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,430
How much did it cost?

1059
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,666
- [Jesus] Yeah, it should be
printing the metrics here.

1060
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:46,760
I think I have...

1061
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,944
Right now, in the base-

1062
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:52,200
- [Robert] We haven't
benchmarked this exercise

1063
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,340
and the specific number of credits

1064
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,343
that it would consume in Kiro yet.

1065
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:56,299
- [Jesus] Yeah.

1066
00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:57,613
- [Audience Member] I'm just curious.

1067
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:58,946
- [Robert] Yeah.

1068
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,910
- [Jesus] Yeah, so I don't
have right away the point.

1069
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,820
But we can do that, to try
and print the metrics for you.

1070
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,890
- [Audience Member] Yes, I'm curious.

1071
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,407
- [Jesus] Yeah, so-

1072
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:13,630
- [Audience Member] (indistinct) Design,

1073
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,638
but how much it costs.

1074
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:17,220
- [Jesus] (chuckles) Alright.

1075
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,830
So going back to the report,

1076
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,330
if you want to see the report,

1077
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,880
is the MD, it has pretty
extensive documentation.

1078
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,880
It should have also some
recommendation around buckets,

1079
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,187
information that we didn't have before,

1080
00:45:35,187 --> 00:45:38,340
and also some links around documentation

1081
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,650
and even some code of how
to modify, for example,

1082
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,634
the load balancer that we
identified that is running,

1083
00:45:43,634 --> 00:45:47,190
expanding on multiple AC, and so on.

1084
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,733
Again, if we want to
simplify this a little bit,

1085
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,630
of the code, because now our v1 version

1086
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,400
is more than 500 line of code

1087
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,650
that we may not need all of them.

1088
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,550
So what if we say that I
want to create a new version?

1089
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,023
Alright, it's gonna be v2.

1090
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,020
Let me show you the prompt here.

1091
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,640
So I'm gonna be creating a new version

1092
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,600
of this resilience agent,
but based on the first one,

1093
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,220
but with an additional tool,

1094
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,430
I want to configure the MCP,
the knowledge MCP server,

1095
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,980
and also remove all the tools

1096
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,780
to get resources from AWS instead

1097
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,593
of use the predefined use AWS
tool that comes from Strands.

1098
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:32,970
So the idea here is just
to simplify the code

1099
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,050
and similar to what we did

1100
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,790
in the first Kiro CLI,

1101
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,530
it's gonna be creating a Python file

1102
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,100
with a Strands agent
that is simple to read

1103
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,723
and basically it's prompted.

1104
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,630
So again, let's see

1105
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,503
how it should look like while
it generates the code for us.

1106
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,450
So can you read there?

1107
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,270
Okay, so it's pretty similar.

1108
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:08,010
We have the response and a
structure format output response.

1109
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,407
But now we have a system
prompt saying that similar,

1110
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,520
"You are an AWS edge resilient expert,

1111
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,430
you have real access to
real time AWS documentation

1112
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,770
and your role is to analyze
the infrastructure deployment

1113
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,150
and provide a comprehensive
resilient report."

1114
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,100
Pretty similar, we have our model.

1115
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,490
Now we have this MCP client

1116
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,410
that is a streamablehttp_client

1117
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,767
that it has access to
the endpoint of the MCP

1118
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:36,180
and we are creating an agent

1119
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,597
that with a model, and say like,

1120
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:40,350
"Now you are gonna be
using this tool, use AWS,"

1121
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,750
this is a tool that is
embedded in Strands.

1122
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,940
We'll see it here in Strands tool.

1123
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,110
You can find more tools available

1124
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,720
on the documentation on GitHub,
on the Strands tools repo.

1125
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,540
And also now we're gonna be
using the aws_knowledge_mcp,

1126
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,300
that it's basically
what we defined before.

1127
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,980
- [Robert] And instead of
having all those tools,

1128
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,830
get_outposts, get_availability_zones,
get_ec2_instances,

1129
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,510
you could define all those tools manually

1130
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,240
or you could have your Strands Agent

1131
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,010
in turn be an MCP client

1132
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,870
that connects to these remote MCP servers.

1133
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:13,980
- Yeah.
- Saving you a bunch of time.

1134
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,210
- [Jesus] Now, if you see,

1135
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,670
it's running the v2 version.

1136
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,440
It's using the tools to get all
the resources documentation,

1137
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,140
and also it's using the AWS
search documentation itself.

1138
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,920
Now it's pretty similar to
the second version that we did

1139
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,337
with Kiro CLI saying like,

1140
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:32,310
"Hey, now you have access to the tool,

1141
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,435
now you have access to
the AWS environment,

1142
00:48:35,435 --> 00:48:38,820
and just figure out and do all the things

1143
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,940
that you need in order to
get that information for me."

1144
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,430
So once we run that,

1145
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,660
we should get a report pretty
similar to the first one,

1146
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,370
maybe with more details
because now it's conducting,

1147
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,810
okay, it's printing here.

1148
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,780
It has access to more resources

1149
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,687
because it can think instead
of saying the static,

1150
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:03,240
"Oh, you have access to a ALB,

1151
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,250
you have access to the EC2."

1152
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,960
It can figure out, "Oh, I need access

1153
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,800
to the placement group.

1154
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,440
I need access to
understand what are the S3,

1155
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,750
how is the NLBs," or whatever resources

1156
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,970
that are spanning in
across our infrastructure.

1157
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,380
It's generating that.

1158
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,140
I'm gonna be showing one that is similar,

1159
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,820
we just created this.

1160
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,480
But basically, the output
should be something similar

1161
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,410
of what we are running, right?

1162
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,663
So any question here?

1163
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:35,995
Nope? Yeah.

1164
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:38,610
- [Audience Member] So I
see instantiating agent,

1165
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,443
I'm just curious about the code itself.

1166
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:44,167
What's driving the event
loop or the agent loop?

1167
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:48,420
Are we just like calling
agent on run and it's just-

1168
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,907
- [Jesus] Yeah, so let's say the code

1169
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,410
of the agent loop part here.

1170
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,120
So the agent itself, it's basically to...

1171
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,540
You have to select which
is the model, alright?

1172
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,970
And you can have different
model provider here,

1173
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,357
you can use OpenAI, you can use Bedrock.

1174
00:50:04,357 --> 00:50:06,240
In this particular case,
we're using Bedrock,

1175
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,900
but you can implement even
your own provider, alright?

1176
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,430
And then, you have a set of
tools that it's available,

1177
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,496
the system prompt, and then you want,

1178
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:20,790
when you want to call
it, it's basically agent.

1179
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:24,660
It's like, "Do this, run
this execution for me."

1180
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,180
And this is the prompt that
we're asking the agent.

1181
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,837
The agent, what we're asking is,

1182
00:50:28,837 --> 00:50:30,256
"Please conduct a comprehensive

1183
00:50:30,256 --> 00:50:32,040
AWS infrastructure resilience analysis

1184
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,527
for this region," is the
variable that it's passing,

1185
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:37,470
"and the report must be generated on,"

1186
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,247
the current date, alright, today.

1187
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:40,830
"And include the following things,"

1188
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,280
edge infrastructure report,
it generates that for you.

1189
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,610
So it's kind of, you define
where is the system from,

1190
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,990
from the agent, the tools available,

1191
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:50,910
and then you ask the things.

1192
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,110
So in order to have a
respond that is a structure,

1193
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,700
you need to pass this argument

1194
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,500
that is a structure output model.

1195
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,450
And it's basically a class

1196
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:03,780
that says in description mode

1197
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,420
what is the model the agent needs

1198
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,870
to fulfill as a response, alright?

1199
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,760
Suppose that you can have something,

1200
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,700
an agent that validates
information for a person.

1201
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,810
You may need to have age,
name, address, whatever.

1202
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,920
You may ask something

1203
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,010
and then you can ask directly
information response,

1204
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,930
a structural response that edge,

1205
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,733
and you have the information there.

1206
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,463
Clear?

1207
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,290
We have eight more minutes, awesome.

1208
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,660
So it's gonna be generating this.

1209
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,220
Let's dive deep a little
bit on what we have.

1210
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,750
While this generate,

1211
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,340
let's talk a little bit
of how we can create

1212
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,940
multi-agent patterns on Strands.

1213
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,320
So now we saw information around, okay,

1214
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,768
now we have the call, we
have access to some tools,

1215
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:03,180
and we can create a new version

1216
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,590
that has multiple agents.

1217
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,660
Instead of having isolated tools,

1218
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,250
what if we can create an agent

1219
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,190
that is an expert of assist admin?

1220
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,750
For example, AWS's admin,

1221
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,060
it has access to your AWS environment

1222
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,790
and it can do read
operation, write operation,

1223
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,250
whatever is the scope of the agent.

1224
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,530
So it has access to a specific tool.

1225
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:26,009
Then, you can do an AWS
documentation expert

1226
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:31,009
where it has access to the
MCP of the AWS knowledge.

1227
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,677
And then, you can figure out and say,

1228
00:52:32,677 --> 00:52:36,180
"Hey, I want a coordinator
that I want you to,"

1229
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,470
I will be sending a request
and using those agents,

1230
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,170
it will figure out, it
will have as a tool,

1231
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:47,190
it will figure out and do,
perform the action for me.

1232
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,740
So this one is gonna be the third agent

1233
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,240
that we're gonna be implementing if we,

1234
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,010
ooh, I think we have time.

1235
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,900
But then, we have other kind of pattern.

1236
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,790
We can do something like instead

1237
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,250
of having agents unpack that

1238
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,400
and provide that agent as
a tool for other agent,

1239
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,200
we can do a kind of graph

1240
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,440
where this agent can talk with other,

1241
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,530
in a kind of a deck, direct graph.

1242
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,690
So we can say, which is the flow,

1243
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,400
like I'm the researcher,

1244
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,130
I'm gonna be passing the
information to the writer,

1245
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,830
and the writer pass the
information to the reviewer,

1246
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,380
and the reviewer print
the output, for example.

1247
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,860
And this just a kind of graph information.

1248
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,660
And then we can create a kind of workflow

1249
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,790
that in the graph, we can go back

1250
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,004
and we can define the
transitions going back and forth,

1251
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:35,340
but it's established transition, right?

1252
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,720
Stable transitions.

1253
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,640
And in the kind of workflow,

1254
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,070
it's basically a structural
coordinator of task

1255
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,547
that we can define, "First
step, do this, second step,"

1256
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,600
Second step, do whatever,
like researching,

1257
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,710
like coding, right?

1258
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,170
If we want to code an
application, maybe we need

1259
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,070
to figure out first is
the architecture itself.

1260
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,510
Send the coder, the tester,
and the reviewer and so on.

1261
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,110
So we can create a kind of flow.

1262
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,810
Third, we have the Swarm pattern.

1263
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,360
In the Swarm pattern,
it's a kind of multi-agent

1264
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,610
that there's no a single coordinator.

1265
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,680
It's basically between them.

1266
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,560
They figure out the task and they,

1267
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,560
you can specify the Swarm
agent two different ways.

1268
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:24,727
You can define a Swarm agent saying like,

1269
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,700
"Hey, you have this complete task.

1270
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,370
Create the agents that
are expert in this,"

1271
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,870
in each particular area.

1272
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,160
And each particular area,

1273
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,050
they start talking each other

1274
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,810
as they believe they needs to do.

1275
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,713
Or you can specify a specific agents,

1276
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:43,107
you can create agents like
AWS documentation expert,

1277
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:45,990
the sysadmin expert, the report expert,

1278
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,547
and then as a whole, say like,
"Hey, I have this problem.

1279
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:51,120
Figure out how to solve it."

1280
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,807
And they will be passing information like,

1281
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:54,087
"Hey, I need to talk with the expert."

1282
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:55,027
The expert saying like,

1283
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:57,630
"Hey, I need to talk with a sysadmin

1284
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,070
to get this information.

1285
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,440
Go back to the other
documentation expert."

1286
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,470
And they can retrieve the
information and work as whole,

1287
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,533
sharing information across
the agent dynamically.

1288
00:55:08,636 --> 00:55:11,013
You want to see the code of Swarm,

1289
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,713
how it looks like,

1290
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,583
I have a couple of samples here.

1291
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,340
So still generating the...

1292
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,473
Oh, let me close this, the second.

1293
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,633
So in the Swarm part,

1294
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,540
we are saying here that,
again, we have our response,

1295
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,647
but then we are creating agent one.

1296
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:40,800
"You are the infrastructure expert.

1297
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,960
Your name is Infrastructure Discovery,

1298
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,840
and you are an agent that specialize

1299
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,510
in discovering and
cataloging AWS resources."

1300
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:52,980
So it have access to the tool, use_aws.

1301
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,390
Second, we have an agent

1302
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,830
that it's the Best Practice,

1303
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,770
it has access to the aws_knowledge_mcp.

1304
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,420
Third, we have an agent that it says that,

1305
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,890
"What is the gap analysis?"

1306
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,420
It doesn't have any kind of tool,

1307
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,020
but it says based on the
specialized agent, alright,

1308
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,340
comparing our infrastructure

1309
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,217
versus the Best Practice,
which are the gaps," alright?

1310
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:13,077
And it figure out what are the gaps

1311
00:56:13,077 --> 00:56:15,190
and what we need to do in order to make

1312
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,990
our infrastructure pretty similar

1313
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,620
or compare against the AWS Best Practice.

1314
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,170
And then, we have the recommendation.

1315
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,120
Again, "You are a recommendation agent.

1316
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,270
Based on the previous information,

1317
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,430
just gather and create an actionable

1318
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,660
remediation plan for that."

1319
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,050
And based on that, we create a Swarm

1320
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,450
and it says like, "Okay,
let's create a Swarm

1321
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,307
where we have all these agent.

1322
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:43,200
The first that will receive this

1323
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,790
is the Infrastructure agent."

1324
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,730
You can put the Best
Practice, whatever you want.

1325
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,110
And you have some transition

1326
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,330
and that situation that you can take.

1327
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:54,630
As we don't define how the
transition will look like,

1328
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,017
it just start talking each other like,

1329
00:56:56,017 --> 00:56:58,350
"Hey, I'm the expert of this information."

1330
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,927
So it pass information to the other one

1331
00:56:59,927 --> 00:57:03,090
and it just create a kind of mesh loop

1332
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:07,773
instead having interaction
between all the agents.

1333
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,680
And the Agent as Tool,

1334
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,093
alright, which is, let
me see if this finish.

1335
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,020
We can ask our third version

1336
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,820
to create a Agent as Tool,

1337
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,950
I'll be sharing here.

1338
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,037
But the Agent as Tool,

1339
00:57:28,037 --> 00:57:30,547
now what we're saying is,

1340
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:35,280
"Alright, now I just
want to have an expert

1341
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,030
that it's a AWS sysadmin expert,"

1342
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,200
and we define this as a tool.

1343
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,900
But if you see, the implementation code

1344
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,560
of this tool is, again, it's an agent.

1345
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,970
So we have the same pattern.

1346
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,090
We have an agent with a
model, we have a tool,

1347
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,970
but we are exposing this function,

1348
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,620
which is an agent itself,

1349
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,570
as a tool that can be consumed

1350
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,410
by another agent as a
coordinator agent, alright?

1351
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,360
So we can create a kind of tree

1352
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,536
where we have a coordinator
talking with other agents

1353
00:58:07,536 --> 00:58:09,186
that are being exposed as a tool.

1354
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,050
In this case, we have a sysadmin expert

1355
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,170
that have access to the use_aws tool.

1356
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,640
We have a documentation expert

1357
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,040
that have access to the MCP.

1358
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,660
And alright, and we have
the finally the coordinator

1359
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,620
that provide information to both tools,

1360
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,393
and it provide information for you.

1361
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,620
- [Robert] So that's about all
the time we have left here.

1362
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,160
But just to give you I guess a
little bit of parting wisdom.

1363
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,160
We recognized that we had to
make trade-offs in the session

1364
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,310
of going all in on what
those best practices are

1365
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,870
for resiliency while trying

1366
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,130
to introduce all these primitives

1367
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,740
for generative AI and
agentic AI specifically.

1368
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,480
And we thought that to
strike a healthy balance,

1369
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,220
we would show you how to take

1370
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,200
or how to go from a
static resiliency report

1371
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,520
with a simple Python file

1372
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,470
to starting to integrate MCP servers,

1373
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:01,653
Strands Agents, Kiro CLI, and Kiro's IDE.

1374
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,680
And to take that one step further,

1375
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,530
if you've had sessions that
you've seen around AgentCore,

1376
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,780
you could run that Strands Agent

1377
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,360
that we created in AgentCore.

1378
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,500
So you don't have to run
it remotely on your laptop.

1379
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,390
You could have it running in

1380
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,750
that secure, isolated environment.

1381
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,130
So we hope that this painted a picture

1382
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,770
of what the future of, let's say,

1383
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:26,160
your Well-Architected Framework
review could look like

1384
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,770
for your applications using AWS hybrid

1385
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,506
and edge services or otherwise.

1386
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:32,910
If you're interested in getting

with hybrid and edge services,

Thanks for hanging out with
us and we'll stick around

1392

to answer any questions and look

1393
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,500
into that credits question you asked.

1394
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,120
