1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,999
- Okay. Hi all.

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,660
Yinon Costica running
product management, one

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,150
of the co-founders at Wiz.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,670
First thank you for coming to
this session and to re:Invent.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,650
Super excited to be here.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,500
And today we're actually gonna cover

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,217
how cloud security became AI security

8
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:25,260
and how are we thinking about securing

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,053
the new attack surface that
is now generated with AI.

10
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:33,210
We have a packed agenda,
I'll try to keep it

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,210
in under 45 minutes and leave
Q&A 15 minutes afterwards.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,130
But we're really gonna cover first

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,010
how did the attack
surface change as a result

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,920
of introducing AI both from the blue side,

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,480
from the red side, we're going
to cover AI security with Wiz

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,710
and how do we see organizations
customers actually securing

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,600
their AI transformation?

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,769
We're gonna cover also

19
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:02,730
how can we accelerate our
security operations, our ability

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,980
to detect faster, respond faster,

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,231
and be one step ahead
of the bad guys with the

22
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,790
attack surface management
capabilities that we've released

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,280
and also how we are introducing agents

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,570
to our operating model
to be faster than ever.

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,570
So with that packed agenda,
let's start with the

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,160
basically how does the
attack surface change

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,395
and what are the new things
we should think about

28
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:30,330
as we think about AI?

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,440
And the first thing is really,
does AI actually happen?

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,900
Is it a real thing or is it just a hype?

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,399
The answer is based on a servers surveys

32
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,820
that we're doing times and again.

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,030
AI is real, your development
teams are using it whether you

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,390
like it or not, everybody's
adopting it to the scale

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,390
that almost every one out,
like just one environment out

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,500
of 10 is not using at
least one hosted AI model.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,990
We are seeing that you have AI software

38
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,990
that is hosted on your VMs,
containers also managed AI.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,460
All of the bedrocks of
the world is being used

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,210
across 80%, roughly 80%
of all cloud environments.

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,500
So it's a real deal.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,300
And even if we look at the more,

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,470
let's say advanced AI
implementations, agents, MCP,

44
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,530
these are also in use already

45
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,140
for instance MCP in use
across more than half

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,210
of the cloud environments today

47
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,631
or this is one of the fastest
adopted technologies we've

48
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,370
seen historically.

49
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,780
And it's amazing to see

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,290
how fast organizations
businesses can actually bring it

51
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,290
into their environments to
make business value out of it.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,180
And from even the
development perspective, 80%

53
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,180
of all environments have at
least one AI ID extension.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
And more than this, even when you look

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,650
at the GitHub application ecosystem,

56
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,390
almost 20% already run in AI application.

57
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,690
So this is to say that
when we think about AI,

58
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,363
it's not just people experimenting

59
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,470
with like some technologies.

60
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,499
Across the board, AI is being adopted

61
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,700
and it's something that we have to account

62
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,730
for when we think about
our cloud security.

63
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,620
Now, on top of this also the bad guys,

64
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,710
the threat actors are leveraging AI

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,540
and we're gonna spend some time

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,959
into how should we think about

67
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,959
AI changing the way attackers
are actually behaving?

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,310
One thing that is relatively
easy to understand is

69
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,450
that like we are using AI in order

70
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,130
to accelerate, be faster, more efficient

71
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,530
in what we do, attackers
do it in the same way.

72
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,570
So if they want to
create a phishing email,

73
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,080
they can do it faster, better

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,310
with AI that's an easy example.

75
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,440
But when we think even about stuff

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,860
like weaponizing vulnerabilities,
the time it takes

77
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,710
to weaponize the vulnerability
from the moment the CV

78
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,710
is released to the time you
have an exploit ready can

79
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,720
be automated dramatically with AI.

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,600
And we're seeing sometimes
it's down to hours, minutes.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,058
If it's a simple vulnerability

82
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:14,070
that you can actually
get to a working exploit

83
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,290
that you can start spraying, that's scary.

84
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,320
It doesn't leave us with a
lot of time for patching.

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,420
It accelerates in reconnaissance instead

86
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,010
of doing reconnaissance manually,

87
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,930
we can automate it using AI.

88
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,510
So there is a lot of
acceleration that happens

89
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,510
on the red side with AI and in
order to understand basically

90
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,020
that the attack surface is
existing and actually expanding,

91
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,733
we launched recently a competition.

92
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,490
I won't spoil it

93
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,206
because we're gonna run
the competition next week

94
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:52,234
at Black Europe, but the
competition basically has more

95
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:55,932
than 20 technologies that
are very commonly used

96
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:58,950
within AI and cloud native architectures.

97
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,400
Whether these are Kubernetes
technologies, web technologies,

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,940
AI technologies like
Ollama NVIDIA toolkit.

99
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,170
And basically we are
asking for researchers

100
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,960
to find RCs on these technologies.

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,890
Now I will say that it's
gonna be very interesting

102
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,760
to see the results.

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,760
We've received a numerous
basically candidates for RCs.

104
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,950
But the more interesting
thing, and it's really

105
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,140
to understand that the vulnerabilities

106
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,600
that are found are not only
found in the components

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,931
that we're using to
build our AI applications

108
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,850
and cloud application.

109
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,030
They're actually found
through AI research.

110
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,990
So AI is helping this time, the good guys,

111
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,284
but in other cases also the bad guys

112
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:48,090
to find vulnerabilities in any software

113
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,010
that we're using faster.

114
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,100
So that's just to think
about accelerating processes.

115
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,995
And one of the other
things that we've seen

116
00:05:55,995 --> 00:06:00,090
with AI, an emerging use of AI in malware.

117
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,640
Now this is like relatively novel.

118
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,470
You can see example, the first example

119
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,475
I think was in LameHug.

120
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:09,240
It was reported by the Ukrainian cert

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,575
and this is basically a
malware that got commands

122
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:15,540
through and basically ran it as a prompt.

123
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,780
So you can literally read the comments

124
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,980
that the malware received.

125
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,610
It's like plain English,
make a list of everything

126
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,280
that you see, search for secrets, search

127
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,530
for a sensitive file, search for access

128
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,850
to production environment.

129
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,985
And also in the Amazon queue
basically developer extension

130
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:38,714
attack that happened, it was
also leveraged AI prompts

131
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,800
on the device itself.

132
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,080
The most recent example for it were came

133
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,870
in the singularity attack were basically

134
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,630
through a supply chain vulnerability
threat actors were able

135
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,670
to land on developer machines

136
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,250
and then you can see the
type of prompts they ran

137
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,026
on top of it, a search
for sensitive file, search

138
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:59,340
for secrets that will gain them access

139
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,740
to production environments to code.

140
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,190
And this is just, and by the
way, everything I'm saying

141
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,510
is just the tip of the iceberg.

142
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,390
We have fantastic
research that is published

143
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,210
on our blog and you can
really read through.

144
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,960
This is like yet another
research paper by Scott Piper.

145
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,610
It really shows how malware
is transitioning to simplify.

146
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,050
So if you are running locally,

147
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,990
your agent malware can use it as well.

148
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,799
And our IoCs that used to
be IPs hashes now become

149
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,220
basically sentences in English

150
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,380
that has a malicious
intent, right? (chuckles)

151
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,470
So that's what we start thinking
when we think about a new

152
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,520
attack surface,

153
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,120
not just accelerating things
we're already familiar with.

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,430
So new techniques, we have

155
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,380
what we call living off the LLM.

156
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,643
I get to a machine, then it has agents

157
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,970
I can leverage these agents to pull

158
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,540
to basically move laterally
to pull to do reconnaissance.

159
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,980
So that's one example.

160
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,640
Second one is using AI related
components, models, prompts,

161
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,560
MCPs compromise them,

162
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,570
having a malicious model on hugging face.

163
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,550
So if someone downloads it

164
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,310
and uses it, it infects an environment.

165
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,080
And lastly, agent compromise.

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,416
We have seen again recently
the sales SalesLoft

167
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:19,290
drift attack where through
the code of the agent,

168
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,740
basically the threat actors
were able to get keys tokens

169
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,720
to sensitive customer environments.

170
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,010
And this is just to show

171
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,400
that the attack surface now
is not only accelerating

172
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,523
because of the use of AI,
it's actually expanding.

173
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,330
Vibe-coding is another great tool

174
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,850
that is being used more and more.

175
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,070
It's great, it allows non-developers

176
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,330
to develop applications.

177
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,780
It allows developers to develop faster.

178
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,310
But one of the things we've seen,

179
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,090
and that's again a series of
research papers we've released,

180
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,990
is that vibe-coding
platforms have some patterns

181
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,210
in which they produce the code.

182
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,030
And some of these patterns
are vulnerable by design.

183
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,486
For instance, you implement authentication

184
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:06,030
and the entire logic sits on
the customer on the client-side

185
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,320
or you embed secrets or tokens
and then they are downloaded

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,930
to the client-side as well.

187
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,700
And we're seeing these patterns.

188
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,650
There are known vulnerabilities,

189
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,110
but this time it's actually the platform

190
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,700
that generates it systemically
into the applications.

191
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380
So we think about vibe-coding

192
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,500
and this is again introduces
a whole new area of risk.

193
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,950
For instance, are the
vibe-coding platforms generate

194
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,400
secure code or maybe they have
some systemic risk we have

195
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,243
to account for.

196
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,880
Like any other application,
we generate an application,

197
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,940
there may very well be
vulnerabilities in it that we need

198
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,140
to fix non-systemic endemic
to the application we created.

199
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,230
And the last piece, attackers
can vibe-code as well.

200
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,650
So in the past to be an
attacker and develop attacking

201
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,680
and like attack tools, offensive
tools, it required a lot

202
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,730
of efforts and usually they were generic

203
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,840
and not very specific.

204
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,240
But if it's very easy to develop tools,

205
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,600
maybe I can develop a
tool per target, right?

206
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,910
So I can become very targeted

207
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,540
in how I develop vibe-code offensive tools

208
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,330
so I can get faster during attacks.

209
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,330
So all of this we try to
map and understand all

210
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,050
of these new risks and
how should we be thinking

211
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,940
about these new threats.

212
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,553
And we came up with this quadrant model

213
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:35,040
and I'm gonna spend a bit of time on it

214
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,723
because I think it's
important to understand

215
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:40,047
that a lot of the things
we see are actually related

216
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:43,207
to an attack surface we already know.

217
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,900
Code secrets, these are things that were

218
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,360
in using attacks and will be used.

219
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,080
But obviously threat actors
can use existing techniques

220
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080
or new techniques to
exploit it faster, better.

221
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,490
The other thing that we're seeing

222
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,890
is a completely novel attack surface.

223
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,840
Like the models like we now
we have training data sets,

224
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,500
but let's say training
data sets in public buckets

225
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,090
that are now exposed.

226
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,465
This is an existing technique targeting

227
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,770
a new attack surface.

228
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,540
So the other dimension that we want

229
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,700
to think about is whether
it's a new technique

230
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,350
or an existing technique?

231
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,470
Are the threat actors
using the same things

232
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,650
or are they inventing
more stuff, new stuff

233
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,330
that we need to account for?

234
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,810
So when we think about the new
stuff we want to account for,

235
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,650
so the AI powered malware is
definitely a new technique

236
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,010
but it uses existing attack surface.

237
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,460
And if you think about
these four quadrants,

238
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,980
this actually gives us a
really good understanding

239
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,950
on how should we think about our response

240
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,720
to these attacks, to this new
expanding threat landscape.

241
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
First on the that are known techniques

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,000
with expanded attack surface, we need

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,340
to be really good in keeping up

244
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,080
and improving the platform we use

245
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,760
to secure the to create code.

246
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,680
We need also to secure the code.

247
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,900
We need to think about
every single code piece

248
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,210
of code we generate
and how do we secure it

249
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,450
at the get-go, even if it was vibe-coded.

250
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,720
On the flip side, if we look

251
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,330
at the new components, we
have to extend our tooling

252
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,810
into securing the new
attack surface as well.

253
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,190
So when we think about okay,

254
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,530
how do we secure AI applications?

255
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,841
We have to extend our CSPMs, our Synapse

256
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,780
to do AI-SPM.

257
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,790
We want to protect AI as well.

258
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,093
Same concept extended
to a new attack surface.

259
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,750
On the novel techniques,
this is really tricky.

260
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,150
How can we face all of
these novel techniques

261
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,970
that are now being applied against us?

262
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,500
So one on the existing attack
surface always keeping great

263
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,030
fundamentals is key.

264
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,490
We have to scan better, we
have to be faster, we have

265
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,150
to implement fundamental security first.

266
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,850
But then we also need to start thinking

267
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,230
how can we leverage in our
defenses AI based tools?

268
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,750
So they AI based tools will test us,

269
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,910
will tell us whether we
are doing a good job.

270
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,730
So when we are actually
scanning our environments,

271
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,510
we'll do it with a new
AI enabled, let's say

272
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,900
view like the threat actors use.

273
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,660
And then on the bottom
right quadrant, that's

274
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,000
where we are gonna see
a lot more innovation

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,670
because these are really new threats.

276
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,240
So malicious models, we had
to come up with a concept

277
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,980
to how do we scan models?

278
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,110
How do we actually do it the same way

279
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,390
that we scan containers
but we needed to build it

280
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,820
from scratch, we needed
to make it available.

281
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,740
And same thing will happen across all

282
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,530
of these new techniques
on the new attack surface.

283
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,200
That's where we are going
to continue and innovate.

284
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,960
But the good news is that
the other three quadrant,

285
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,790
we can actually secure it today.

286
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,020
And we can work on it

287
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,830
and we can actually
fortify our AI applications

288
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,453
with the tools we already have.

289
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,190
The last challenge is really
about the visibility piece.

290
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,620
And when we think about AI visibility,

291
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,010
it's such a hard problem
and I want to spend

292
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,160
like a couple of minutes
explaining like why is it so hard?

293
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,230
Answering a very simple question like

294
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,420
where am I using AI in the environment?

295
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,270
So first what is an AI application, right?

296
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,490
So you have the
infrastructure, the transit.

297
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,460
When we think about the
infrastructure, you have containers,

298
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,400
you have gateways, you
have buckets, databases,

299
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,638
these are the things you consume from AWS,

300
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:32,340
other cloud providers on any application.

301
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,283
So that's a Synapse layer,
right? The infrastructure.

302
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,330
Second, you have the new
components, the model, the AI.

303
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,200
You have the model, the training
pipeline you have basically

304
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,800
where actually you're storing
the data for the pipeline.

305
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,850
You have the guardrails,

306
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,740
you have the prompts, you have the MCPs,

307
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,870
these are the new
technologies you're bringing

308
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,680
into making this is what
makes it an AI application.

309
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,690
And then you have the
data component to it.

310
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,450
Data is important from
three different angles.

311
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,920
One, what is the data that is
the input from the outside?

312
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,550
So what data comes and
leaves to the end user?

313
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,580
What data was the model trained on?

314
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,850
And then what data does
the agent have access to?

315
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,800
Because I can trigger an agent to go

316
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,119
and pull new data, I need to be able

317
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:21,090
to know what it is accessible to?

318
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,490
So this is the third layer of AI.

319
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,310
And then the last layer is
actually the application itself.

320
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,480
Where does the code see

321
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,790
how is it exposed, how is it configured?

322
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,830
And then only when you combine all

323
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,220
of these four components together,
this is where you're able

324
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,881
to say, okay, I understand

325
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:40,080
that I have an AI application,
this is how it works

326
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,030
and these are all the
components that pertain to it.

327
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,930
Because as a threat actor, I
can go with every single layer

328
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,810
and try to compromise your AI application.

329
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,471
And why is it such a hard task?

330
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:54,897
Because do you know what other
tool has visibility to all

331
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:57,060
of these layers in one piece?

332
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,430
That's why when we look at the Synapse,

333
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,380
the Wiz graph security graph,

334
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,720
we feel like we have a
really good understanding

335
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,880
of where the AI applications live,

336
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,730
how are they constructed,
where are they running?

337
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,570
And just to make it a bit
more complex, (chuckles)

338
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,220
it's actually a lot more complex

339
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,650
because I showed you
a naive example on AI.

340
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,703
But if you think about the decisions,

341
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:20,700
the architectural decisions

342
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,090
that developers can make in
building these application.

343
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,920
So they can take the model,

344
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,950
they can host it locally
on a VM, on a container,

345
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,550
they can use it as a pass
from Bedrock, they can use it

346
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,830
as a SaaS from open AI.

347
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,440
They can actually, they
have multiple choices

348
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,740
and we as security we need
to account for all of them.

349
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,930
When we think about agents, same thing.

350
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,360
When we think about identities,

351
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,350
how do agents actually can perform tasks?

352
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,650
They can get cloud roles, they
can have applicative roles

353
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,450
and they can have SaaS roles.

354
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,240
We need to account for all
of these choices. (chuckles)

355
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,670
So not to make it too complex,

356
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,270
but we have a very hard problem
actually understanding all

357
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,180
of the AI applications that
live in our environment

358
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,520
so we can start securing them.

359
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,160
And we spent a 15 minutes
like covering around

360
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:16,770
what is the impact on our attack surface?

361
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,520
What is the impact that
on both blue side red side

362
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,870
that we should account for?

363
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,130
And just to summarize this,

364
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,520
we we think about four items mainly

365
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,130
a new technology stick
that we need to secure.

366
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,080
A new construct like agents

367
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,210
that are operating in our environment

368
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,120
and then acceleration of two processes.

369
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,692
Acceleration of development, so more stuff

370
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:42,030
to secure and acceleration
of threat to actors

371
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,513
and how they can weaponize
and carry attacks against us.

372
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,680
And there now to the silver lining,

373
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,049
we have the tools to secure.

374
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,660
Okay, so let's look at it in a, sorry,

375
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,220
let's look at it in two ways.

376
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,460
One, how do we extend the tooling we have

377
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,350
to secure AI workloads?

378
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,340
And second, how do we leverage
AI to become better, faster

379
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,370
in what we do so we can be faster

380
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,143
than the threat actors using AI?

381
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,410
So let's look at AI security.

382
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,990
We're gonna do it in three sections.

383
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,070
The first section is how
do we use a Wiz Synapse

384
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,110
to secure AI workloads?

385
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,848
Second, how do we use an automated tooling

386
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:29,940
like an attack surface
management capability

387
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,400
to identify exposures we need to fix

388
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
before others can find them?

389
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,470
And third, how do we implement agents

390
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,800
into our operating model
so we become faster?

391
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
So tackling the AI security challenge.

392
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,290
First we need to tackle shadow AI.

393
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,360
If we don't see it, we cannot secure it.

394
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,920
It's true, always true.

395
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,650
So the ability to really
map all of the components

396
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,020
of the AI are, it's really the key

397
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,690
to start an AI security program.

398
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,020
The second thing is mapping
all of the infrastructure risks

399
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,090
that we are already familiar with.

400
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,250
If we know how to secure buckets

401
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,960
from being publicly exposed,

402
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,150
let's protect our training data sets

403
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,000
so they won't be exposed
on public buckets.

404
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
And mapping it that way will allow us

405
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,870
to actually use existing
scanners, existing processes

406
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,830
to secure our AI applications
from the infrastructure today.

407
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,110
And this is where we're
actually seeing most

408
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,433
of the AI related AI applications related

409
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,100
breaches actually come from
the infrastructure layer,

410
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,870
not from the application layer.

411
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,090
So this is like the
first step that is key,

412
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,770
second step that is key.

413
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,240
And then we can layer on top all

414
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,550
of the AI native risks, AI native risks.

415
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,040
Like how can we secure the models we use?

416
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,350
How can we assure the guardrails.

417
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,740
And last, monitoring the actual activity

418
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,420
on the AI application.

419
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,710
There is a lot that we can do

420
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,110
by monitoring AI, monitoring models.

421
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,780
Whether it's model
escape, malicious behavior

422
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,460
of an agent and so on.

423
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,710
And then we can monitor it live

424
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,320
and detect threats as they happen.

425
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,660
But there is a lot more we can do

426
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,350
before that to prevent
the threat initially.

427
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,120
So let's start with visibility.

428
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,480
We start with connecting to
all of your cloud environments

429
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,030
to connecting to your SaaS environments

430
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,160
and connecting to your code.

431
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,780
This is allowing us across all
of the development lifecycle

432
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,128
to detect the full breadth of AI

433
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:29,970
that is in use in your development teams,

434
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,070
in your production environments today.

435
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,950
Whether it's identifying SDKs in the code,

436
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,710
whether it's identifying past services,

437
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,080
bedrocks used in your cloud, whether it's

438
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,993
to identify training data sets in buckets.

439
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,590
More than this, today we have

440
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,780
the service catalog capability.

441
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,410
The service catalog actually
takes all of these components,

442
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,140
builds them in a service catalog view.

443
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,140
So you have an applicative
aggregation of these resources,

444
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,990
every single service and
all the resources it uses.

445
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,630
And then you can have a very simple filter

446
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,450
called does it have AI? (chuckles)

447
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,400
And you can go to the service catalog,

448
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,980
it's automatically generated,
scans your environment

449
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,950
and then you can filter
what are all the services

450
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,990
that have an AI component to them?

451
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,480
And that's a denominator you're gonna use

452
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,320
across your AI security
journey, this is a foundation.

453
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,080
And if I am asking you today,
let's say you're a CEO comes

454
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,020
to you today and asks you,
okay, give me the full list

455
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,690
of all the AI applications
in our environment today?

456
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,193
Are we able to give an answer?

457
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,060
Not so much, but through the
service catalog we start having

458
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,240
a structure where we can actually identify

459
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,267
and have governance around
everything that is AI.

460
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,010
And when we think about AI,

461
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,160
so building this inventory will allow us

462
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,660
to build a program will also
allow us to remove shadow AI.

463
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,600
And I think the most prominent
example for shadow AI,

464
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,281
when deeps was announced almost 10%

465
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,239
of all cloud environments were using it

466
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:06,060
within a week, within a week.

467
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,630
And we were asking ourselves
and with our customers,

468
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,210
how can we help customers
really identify all

469
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,860
of these new technologies

470
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,510
and remove them from the environment

471
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,800
if they're not approved?

472
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,270
And that's why we have invested

473
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,820
in these capabilities
to create visibility.

474
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,690
So you can see the SDKs in the code,

475
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,700
you can see the models in your cloud

476
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,920
and then you can put
guardrails around what's

477
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,903
to use and what not to be used.

478
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,250
The lesson very important point
is when we think about AI,

479
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,190
it's not only the application
itself, it's also all

480
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,100
of the pipeline that led to the model.

481
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,570
So we want to know which data
training data sets were used

482
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,100
in order to train a model.

483
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,010
So the visibility doesn't go
only to the app, it's actually

484
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,620
to the entire lives
and the entire pipeline

485
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,663
that created the model for instance.

486
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,220
Second, we take all of
the scanners that we have.

487
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,420
And we have scanners for
identities to identify

488
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,150
what are the permissions
that are granted to agents?

489
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,642
We have scanners on vulnerabilities

490
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:12,137
so we can scan models
and AI technologies SDKs

491
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:14,670
to see that there are not vulnerable.

492
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,990
We can scan network access

493
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,210
to see which ones are internet facing.

494
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,680
And we layer everything
into the same graph

495
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,800
and we are also extending
it with new scanners,

496
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,770
for instance, scanning models for malware,

497
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,480
for malicious behavior.

498
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,910
So we start scanning everything that we do

499
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,390
and we layer it into using
the same vulnerability scanner

500
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,617
that use configuration.

501
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,637
We have released dozens

502
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:42,600
of different configuration posture rules

503
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,293
that extend the CSPM to AI resources

504
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,908
like bedrock and SageMaker.

505
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:53,520
So you can configure your
cloud resources as you should.

506
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,670
So when you're looking at
your existing scanners,

507
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,580
you should really make sure
that they apply seamlessly

508
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,030
to your AI workloads, to
your expanded attack surface.

509
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,340
And we have done it, so out
of the box you don't need

510
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,230
to click anything for it, it just works.

511
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,970
So we scan your entire environment

512
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,890
and we map it to the vulnerabilities,

513
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,147
misconfigurations, exposures,
lateral movement path

514
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:16,920
of identities that are attached to agents

515
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,313
and also to the new scanners
that we have launched.

516
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,550
One challenge is really how do we account

517
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,140
for the new platforms that
are generating applications?

518
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,710
And one of our partners
Lovable, in this case, it's one

519
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,040
of the fastest growing
vibe-coding platform

520
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,982
and really we did a lot
of research with them

521
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:42,090
on vibe-coding security
and what need to be done.

522
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,880
One of the things we
have just implemented is

523
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,140
that any mutual customer
can now basically see

524
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,370
with scans available in their
lovable portal, they can scan.

525
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,490
The scan will be based on the
same policies you're using

526
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,270
for your code security today.

527
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,370
So you don't like, you have the same set

528
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,070
of policies applied across
vibe-coded applications

529
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,920
and traditionally developed applications.

530
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,460
And then you can see the
findings of the code both in Wiz

531
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,967
but also in by the developers in Lovable.

532
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:18,660
So we can start in injecting
the security mining mindset

533
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,290
into the developed application
even if it's vibe-coded.

534
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,533
So we standardized across
vibe-coding, traditional coding

535
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,810
and it's not such a scary thing anymore

536
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,630
because we have our
security guardrails applied.

537
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,930
So that's a new integration that happens.

538
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,960
And when we think about how
do we prioritize all of this?

539
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,180
Because like any scanner,
this will produce

540
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,600
many misconfigurations,
vulnerabilities, exposures.

541
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,990
But we really want to know
what do we need to focus on?

542
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,660
And this is where the graph plays

543
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,040
as always a significant role.

544
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,510
We actually layer everything

545
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,180
into the architecture we
have built in the graph.

546
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,340
We try to map these attack path.

547
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,680
We try to find whether we have risk

548
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,550
to the AI pipeline or
through the AI applications.

549
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,000
And the examples are
just surfacing from with

550
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,590
through the graph detections
we have for instance.

551
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,810
And these are all based on real examples.

552
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,810
Externally facing MCP that
has access to a cloud role.

553
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,560
The cloud role has excessive
access to data they shouldn't.

554
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,720
Someone can literally ask the MCP

555
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,750
to get data and the tooling will do it.

556
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,760
You want to avoid exactly these type

557
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,670
of exposures and you can
do it using the graph.

558
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,670
We can actually see
from the exposed element

559
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,980
to the application, to the identity,

560
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,953
to the actual sensitive
data that it can access.

561
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,440
Same thing about exposing
applications that have agents

562
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,390
that have access to sensitive data

563
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,060
and they all surface regardless
of the platform, regardless

564
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,010
of the implementation
through the security graph.

565
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,440
So you can prioritize it
to your development teams.

566
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,930
And these are all things
that happen today,

567
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,730
like it's not roadmap and these are things

568
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,240
that you connect with and
you can start prioritizing

569
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,113
these combinations across
your AI applications.

570
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,380
Last but definitely not least,

571
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,170
the ability to monitor
the behavior of the AI

572
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,570
and be able to detect whether you have

573
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,990
actual malicious activity
carried against it.

574
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,080
So for instance,
detecting malicious models

575
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,830
or compromise models or model escape.

576
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,870
So this ability is actually achieved

577
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,550
by monitoring the environment

578
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,100
on which the model runs
typically like hosts.

579
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
And we have the runtime sensor

580
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,470
that is now able to monitor
models and detect this.

581
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,396
We should also look at the control plane

582
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:43,680
and identify let's say abnormal activity

583
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,110
around your LLM resources.

584
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,471
So we can identify LLM hijacking attacks

585
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:52,530
that we see also in the world.

586
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,910
And these are all components

587
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,567
that are related to
our defend capabilities

588
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,500
that is really about monitoring

589
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,138
your cloud environments, your runtime,

590
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,010
your runtime workloads

591
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,140
and detecting when bad things happen

592
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,020
so you can respond timely and contain.

593
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,320
So summarizing AI security
in just a few steps.

594
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,140
First, AI visibility first and foremost,

595
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,860
that's a foundation for your
entire AI security program.

596
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,740
Second, scanning for AI risks,

597
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,170
whether these are the known
risks, vulnerabilities,

598
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,960
misconfiguration, whether
these are new risks,

599
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,470
then we prioritize, we remediate
the things that matter.

600
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,730
There is a term coined

601
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,330
by Simon Willison that
is called the Trifecta.

602
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,660
Trifecta means that you can have input

603
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,080
to an application with
access to sensitive data

604
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,660
and it can respond back
with a sensitive data.

605
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,300
So we want to basically be
able to block these type

606
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,920
of toxic combinations, right?

607
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,060
And this is what we do by
prioritizing the issues in Wiz

608
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,730
and last having the runtime monitoring

609
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,663
on a every AI workload
so we can detect threats.

610
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,130
This was AI security
101, you can do it today

611
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,080
with your Wiz environment.

612
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,913
And second,

613
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:08,250
this is a new capability
we have just GAD this week

614
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,890
and this is the attack
surface management capability.

615
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,380
I'm super excited about this capability.

616
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,610
It's very different

617
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,150
than how typical attack surface
management tools operate

618
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:23,150
because it is tightly coupled
with our security graph.

619
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,558
And I want to try to explain
why is it so dramatic in terms

620
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,510
of how we think about
attack surface management

621
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,522
to couple the external scanning
with the deep understanding

622
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:39,093
of the cloud architecture, the
graphs, the security risks.

623
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,690
First, when Wiz connects
to an environment,

624
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,980
the first thing we do is
actually analyzing really good

625
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,700
what are all the potential
exposures this environment is.

626
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,160
Whether it's a checkbox somebody did,

627
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,070
the make this serverless function public,

628
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,360
make this bucket public.

629
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,740
And whether these are applications

630
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,320
that you're exposed through
gateways, load balancers

631
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,833
and so on Wiz maps, all of
this we make public repos

632
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,190
and you can actually have
a really good understanding

633
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,440
of what's potentially exposed.

634
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,230
Through the attack surface
management capability,

635
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,147
we are now automatically scanning them

636
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,470
from the outside like a
threat actor would do.

637
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,860
And we're able to test first fingerprint

638
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,110
what is the technology that is exposed?

639
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,760
Is it a database of this type?

640
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,910
Is it a Jenkins, is it
what is the technology?

641
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,500
And then we are able to test

642
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,500
for multiple different risks
threats against it live.

643
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,170
So if we get a qualified validation.

644
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,590
Did you open in this
case like a PostgreSQL

645
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,130
with the default admin credentials?

646
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,220
Did you have a Jenkins
with misconfiguration

647
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,770
that allows access to configuration files?

648
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,200
Did you expose a resource

649
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,116
with a vulnerability
that can be exploited?

650
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:02,100
We're doing these simple
checks from the outside

651
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,470
and we are able to validate these risks,

652
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,330
but that's only the first step.

653
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,390
Typically with a attack
surface management tools,

654
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,810
you get the external finding
and now it's up to you

655
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,475
to go try to triage it, find

656
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:17,100
who owns this resource,
where is it running?

657
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,920
Maybe it's in the cloud so
it's ephemeral, so it's gone.

658
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,360
And so who does own it?

659
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,650
And then you have many questions

660
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,300
on the triage that actually prevents us

661
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,520
from automating the response to it.

662
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,050
But not with Wiz.

663
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,860
With Wiz we have the entire
story behind under the cover

664
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,860
so we know which resource
actually exposed this endpoint.

665
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,760
We know who like what
can it actually access

666
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,740
so we know whether it's
a sandbox environment

667
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,630
or maybe the main way to your crown jewels

668
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,123
in your crown jewel database.

669
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,260
And then we're able to create
an impact analysis saying this

670
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,250
externally facing asset
has validated exposure

671
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,280
and also a validated impact.

672
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,170
So we can prioritize better

673
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,990
but more than this we
created the attack with,

674
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,090
but we also know who owns it.

675
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,550
Through our code analysis we can correlate

676
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,861
the cloud resource with
the code contributors

677
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:15,660
and now we have an understanding

678
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,120
of who owns a resource, who can fix it.

679
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,430
And we can start automating the response

680
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,603
in terms of ticketing PRs in order to get

681
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:25,923
to the fastest resolution possible.

682
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:29,010
Because we know this is a ticking bomb.

683
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,600
We know that if we were able

684
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,210
to find this, the threat actors can.

685
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,620
And the goal here is actually
to create SOC level findings

686
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,640
for risks before it becomes an incident.

687
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,040
And this is how powerful this tool is.

688
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,400
But one thing is even more powerful.

689
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,010
In order to enable it, it's a toggle.

690
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,260
There is zero deployment,
there is nothing.

691
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,020
You basically have a
toggle and you're done.

692
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,180
It's going to scan your environment

693
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,520
and going to surface the
attack surface findings

694
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
that matter so it can be covered today.

695
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,870
So that's a very powerful way to get ahead

696
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,210
of the attackers and become faster

697
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,300
in how we identify these
potential exposures

698
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,253
and respond to them timely.

699
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,980
And the third pillar that I want

700
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,520
to cover is how do we use
agents in our environment,

701
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,460
in our security operations
in order to be faster?

702
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,000
And for years since the day one

703
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
at Wiz, we always talked about
the cloud operating model.

704
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,930
The tools, the technology is great,

705
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,600
but the real thing that
matters is are we able

706
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,967
to change the way we
are operating in order

707
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:44,850
to really solve the
challenge of cloud security?

708
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,880
And we always talked about democratization

709
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,480
because if we were able to
find the things that matter

710
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,850
and democratize them
to the development team

711
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,820
so the development teams
can fix them immediately,

712
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,910
we are actually fixing
the biggest bottleneck

713
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,740
we had in security.

714
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,560
So now the entire development community

715
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,690
in our organization is working with us

716
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,930
to secure our applications,
so that was great.

717
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:14,460
It allowed us also to shift
left with preventive security.

718
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,000
So once you have a developer,
not like a development team

719
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,210
that sees how how good looks like,

720
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,450
but also how bad looks like,
they're much more inclined

721
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,340
to then implement guardrails

722
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,131
into their development processes

723
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:30,736
in order to prevent mistakes, risks

724
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,940
from being introduced in the first place.

725
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,430
And that's how we were
able to introduce Wiz Code

726
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,500
and actually shift all of the policies

727
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,610
to the development experience
itself to the SDLC.

728
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,070
So we are fixing it at
the source when it's easy

729
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,140
to fix and not afterwards.

730
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,600
And last, after we have
cleaned up the environment,

731
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,420
we have better processes
to deploy, to remediate,

732
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,690
then it's a perfect time
to bring in the SecOps.

733
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,720
They can actually monitor the
environment, they can respond

734
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,850
to threats in the cloud environment

735
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,000
and they can grow their
proficiency in what does it mean

736
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
to really address, contain
threats in cloud setups.

737
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,560
So this was the operating
model we've started,

738
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,030
but the core of it, the
foundation was always the graph.

739
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,970
The graph is a thing that
allowed us to prioritize.

740
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,370
It's allowed us to explain visually.

741
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,930
You don't need to understand much

742
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,960
about this implementation
on this implementation.

743
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,840
When you see an attack path, you see it.

744
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,240
You're saying okay, I need to fix it.

745
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,800
Whether you're in SOC, whether you're

746
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,910
in the development team,

747
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,343
whether you're in security, you get it.

748
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,200
But more than just humans,
what we actually figured out

749
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,660
that if we can teach our agents

750
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,393
to understand the graph,
ask questions on the graph.

751
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,530
They can actually become
very, very powerful as well.

752
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,810
They can be become our colleagues, right?

753
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,320
They can ask questions on the
graph, they can get answers

754
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,990
and that's what we've been
doing in the past year.

755
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,400
So any agent is as good
as a model behind it.

756
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,317
And what's a better way to model security

757
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:07,860
and cloud than the Wiz security graph?

758
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,710
So the first thing that we've done,

759
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,590
and this is something maybe I should ask,

760
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,080
how many of you're running like MCP

761
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,728
with MCP today implementing
your own agents

762
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,490
with the show of hand?

763
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,363
Not too many. Okay, this is
something you can do today.

764
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,655
There are fantastic examples with Wiz.

765
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,450
So let's walk through the,

766
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,400
let's say history of applications.

767
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,490
We used to build applications
and we wanted to integrate.

768
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,770
So we said okay, it has to be API first.

769
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,570
We did it API first.

770
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,810
And now the next wave is
you have to be MCP first.

771
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,460
You have to make everything available

772
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,800
through an external MCP server.

773
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,540
So if you have a team that wants

774
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,663
to know something once context
from Wiz, they can just ask

775
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:55,170
and they get it in
their native experience.

776
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,040
And that's exactly

777
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,280
what the Wiz external MCP
server allow you to do.

778
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
It allows you to streamline
the context from Wiz

779
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,490
to any team, any persona you need.

780
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,290
And we have fantastic customers

781
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,980
that were really sharing how they did it.

782
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,510
We have an example with Grammarly,

783
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,470
again, it's public, you
can go on the website.

784
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,460
Basically Grammarly integrated

785
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,792
into their SOC through the MCP server

786
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,600
of Wiz context about cloud resources.

787
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,320
They were able to achieve 90% efficiency.

788
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,640
90% reduction in time it takes
to the SOC analyst to respond

789
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,840
to threats in cloud given the
context they got from Wiz.

790
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,990
So it's really powerful
and it's achievable today.

791
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,670
So the first thing we would say

792
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,940
in terms of extending
Wiz to agencies, use MCP

793
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,300
to bring context, bring
the knowledge from Wiz

794
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,003
to any persona, any team that needs it.

795
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,020
And you should ask it from
any other vendor, right?

796
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,880
It's not only from Wiz,
you can correlate it

797
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,130
with your threat intelligence agent

798
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,130
with your C agent, with
your ticketing system.

799
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,460
So everything becomes part
of your custom agents.

800
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,500
And this is very achievable today.

801
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,550
Second thing that we've
launched is the SecOps agent.

802
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,500
Now when you are a SOC
analyst, you get a threat,

803
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,866
you start investigating
it, you make queries

804
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,210
in the portal, you use a graph to look

805
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,910
for dependencies, relationships

806
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,830
and over the year we've
basically templatized what,

807
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,830
how does a cloud threat
investigation process look like?

808
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,060
And we were able to
create this knowledge base

809
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,160
that says if you see this,
then you need to look

810
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,650
at all of the these aspects.

811
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,820
And we've done two things.

812
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,840
We taught the the agent
how to query on the graph,

813
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,170
but we also created on top of all

814
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,490
of our APIs tools so
the agent can use them.

815
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,060
So it can read issues, it
can read vulnerabilities,

816
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,780
it can read all events, it
can read all of the context

817
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,650
that a human analyst,
SOC analyst would read

818
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,300
in the Wiz portal.

819
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,200
And now the thing we did
is just every single threat

820
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,170
that is triggered in Wiz Defend

821
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,310
is automatically investigated
by the Wiz SecOps agent.

822
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,760
And we can provide the
full investigation summary,

823
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,595
but it's not just an investigation summary

824
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:24,930
that is black boxed.

825
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,940
It's actually using the same data

826
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,620
that the SOC analyst can use.

827
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,050
So it has a hundred
percent explainability.

828
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,670
You can drill down to every
single investigation step SQAI.

829
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,770
It helps in both ways.

830
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,852
We help analysts to understand
what are best practices

831
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:45,060
to investigate threats in cloud?

832
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,730
But on the other hand we can
actually gain more inputs

833
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,310
about we need to also to investigate this,

834
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,720
we need to investigate that.

835
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,390
So it allows us to learn as a team.

836
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,280
And lastly it provides a verdict.

837
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,916
Based on this investigation, I was able

838
00:39:57,916 --> 00:40:00,300
to see that this is a common pattern.

839
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,340
That's why last time you ignored it.

840
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,380
So I suggest we ignore it as well.

841
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,850
We can do it automatically.

842
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,440
We provide like the real severity

843
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,420
or maybe it looks like a medium,

844
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,400
but it's weird enough
in order to trigger it

845
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,940
as a critical, so it is
able to provide a verdict.

846
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,010
Is it malicious? Is it benign?

847
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,730
Is it an automated test? And
what's the true severity?

848
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,337
We should think we should provide it.

849
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,860
And that way your SOC analyst, instead

850
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,480
of focusing on five alerts a
day, they can actually do 50.

851
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,350
And this is really when we get a scale

852
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,484
and we're able to do not
only addressing the threats

853
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:41,130
that we see today, we're
now able to do much more

854
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,110
to see much more through the mediums,

855
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,670
through the things we rarely see.

856
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,290
We can do more hunting.

857
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,010
So we have a lot more
opportunity to extend the horizon

858
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,990
than just dealing with false negatives.

859
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,990
Right? And then the third
pillar is a remediation agent.

860
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,750
The remediation agent is key

861
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,240
in order to understand
how to fix an issue.

862
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,810
Today when we trigger an
issue, you see the attack path

863
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,060
and typically you go to
the development teams

864
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,660
and they know well we
shouldn't touch here.

865
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,330
Maybe we should fix
there, this is not in use.

866
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,080
Maybe we can just, you know,
shut down the public exposure.

867
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,900
Maybe we can trim the
right size, the permissions

868
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,910
because it's not needed.

869
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,750
It's a lot of knowledge that
is not written anywhere.

870
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,930
The development teams know it
because they know it, right?

871
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,700
They know their application.

872
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,470
But we have the knowledge

873
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,630
and we can sequence these questions

874
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,880
for our remediation agent

875
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,550
to basically see whether a
public exposure is actually

876
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,730
in use or not, whether
permissions are in use or not.

877
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,990
Whether a resource can be
remediated without impact

878
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,410
on the environment, whether
there are dependencies or not.

879
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,280
Whether this bucket is
click oped from the portal.

880
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,940
So you can do the fix
directly in the CSP portal

881
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,487
or whether this bucket
is actually a result

882
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,820
of a cloud formation or a Terraform file.

883
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,220
And you should apply the fix in the code

884
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,690
and we know who is a developer

885
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,520
and we can actually create the PR.

886
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,563
So basically the remediation
agent is analyzing the

887
00:42:14,563 --> 00:42:18,090
ownership, what is the impact
analysis, the attack path,

888
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,370
and what's the best course of action

889
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,370
to remediate a certain issue
that is identified by Wiz?

890
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,520
So MCP, the SecOps agent

891
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,160
and the remediation
agent are all available

892
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,080
for you to integrate today

893
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,290
and accelerate dramatically your

894
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,823
cloud operating model using
these agentic capabilities.

895
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,530
And I know I covered
a few different areas,

896
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,530
but it really comes down to
the model we discussed earlier.

897
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,830
How can we extend the
Synapse to secure any type

898
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,120
of AI workload that is now
created in our environment?

899
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,943
How are we able to
accelerate the detection

900
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:07,170
of exposures threats

901
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,460
before automated attackers
would do it using ASM?

902
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,990
And third, how are we able

903
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,880
to accelerate remediation
response using agents within Wiz?

904
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,590
And these are all the capabilities

905
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:23,490
that were launched actually
recently you can use today

906
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:28,230
that feed exactly into this
winning AI with AI model

907
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,500
where yes, there are new
challenges that are introduced,

908
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,080
but yes, the tooling we have today,

909
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,850
the processes we have implemented

910
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:40,320
for cloud security are robust
enough in order to accelerate,

911
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,100
in order to support this
new technology stack

912
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,590
that is introduced, these new challenges.

913
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,560
And we're confident that as
we continue to implement,

914
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,920
we will be able to securely
enable AI for your businesses,

915
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,690
for your developers.

916
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,680
And with that, this was
a tip of the iceberg

917
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,770
in terms of what Wiz can do.

918
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,840
We will be super excited to show you

919
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,730
like a full demo answer any
questions in our booth, 1447

920
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,900
and just reminding Wiz is a
platform, we covered a lot

921
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,689
of the capabilities.

922
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:19,020
Wiz Code secures the code.
Wiz Cloud analyzes your cloud.

923
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,660
Wiz Defend is for SecOps
team monitoring, responding

924
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,970
to threats, so a lot to show there.

925
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,130
We are a platform to actually secure

926
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,620
the entire cloud development lifecycle.

927
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,440
And with that, I really want
to thank you for the session.

928
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,493
I'll be here for any
questions you may have or

929
00:44:34,493 --> 00:44:36,750
in the booth and thank you very much.

930
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,808
Enjoy re:Invent.

931
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:41,808
