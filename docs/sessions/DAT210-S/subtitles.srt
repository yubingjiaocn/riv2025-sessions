1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,470
- Can you hear me okay?

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,270
Perfect. All right, wonderful.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,070
So the agenda for this, gonna speak for,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,340
I'm so privileged to have one
of our valuable customers,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,130
Equifax, with me today,
to share their experiences

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,720
as well on the multi-cloud.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,150
But I'm gonna spend like
seven, eight minutes talking

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,590
through some general overview topics

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,530
and then hand it over to Avinash and then,

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,330
we try to leave four or five minutes

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,390
if you have any questions
to go through that.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,800
All right, my name is Kambiz Aghili,

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,650
I'm vice president of product for CI

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,970
in charge of multi-cloud.

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,623
So thrilled to be here with you.

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,110
A couple things wanted to
talk about to establish

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,300
what multi-cloud is.

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,400
Oracle has been a, you know,

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,610
best in class database,
(indistinct) database technology

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,590
for the past 40 years.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,500
Any of the eight or nine
out of 10 verticals,

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,350
customers within each
vertical you look at,

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,110
they're utilizing Oracle
one way or another.

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,140
And Oracle has always been
available on premises across

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,760
different deployment models.

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,170
And this is the first time

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,967
that we're bringing the Oracle end to end,

28
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,320
the Exadata technology

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,450
and an entire database services

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,000
and all the surrounding elements

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,610
of the Oracle technology
natively available

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,070
through AWS data center, right?

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,410
So Oracle is in all
clouds, including now AWS

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,040
and Azure and GCP, natively
operating from data center,

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,470
operating from the Exadata hardware.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,180
And we'll talk about some
of the things that are

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,680
so unique about it as opposed

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,780
to operating just on a commodity hardware.

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,880
So we've been working really,
really hard since last year

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
to continue to innovate on
behalf of the customers.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,360
If I were to classify three
categories of innovations

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,610
that we work really hard on, you know,

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,010
on the customer requirements to deliver,

44
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,270
they're threefold.

45
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,080
One is on simplifying the management

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,900
and operations of the database.

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,140
So customers now they have,
you know, access to tools

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,350
to automate the database
infrastructure as code.

49
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,040
They can utilize API, CLI, SDKs,

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,470
cloud formation as well as Terraform.

51
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,710
So simplifies end to end of their journey.

52
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,250
Two, now we do offer customers

53
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,290
the full automated data protection

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,700
in near real time,

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,360
whereas they can utilize
autonomous recovery service

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,950
that was never ever available

57
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,540
through a third party
cloud natively operating

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,230
on our hardware before.

59
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,820
Third is security.

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,580
We understood that it's
really critical for customers

61
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,270
to be able to not only
use our Oracle technology

62
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,380
in terms of a database

63
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,860
and all the underlying services we offer,

64
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,140
but also to be able to integrate very well

65
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,790
with the AWS's best in
class also cloud and AI

66
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,050
as well as the, you know,

67
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,880
operational services and around it.

68
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,360
So for instance, from a security
perspective, now we offer

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,700
as of last week integration

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,130
with the AWS Key Management, KMS.

71
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,170
And this is really fantastic

72
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,120
because customers who love to use KMS,

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,410
they're able to utilize that on Oracle

74
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,900
operating natively on OCI
from the AWS data center

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,070
like never before.

76
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,790
And on that angle, they're
also able to continue

77
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,320
to use other services around
security, including OCI Vault

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,170
and Oracle Key Vault and TDE.

79
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,170
So when you look at the
multi-cloud is basically operating

80
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,100
all the Oracle database services

81
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,570
and services around it,

82
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,780
operating on native Oracle
hardware infrastructure

83
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,760
from the AWS data center, with
the native interoperability

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,033
of the Oracle technology
alongside all the AWS services

85
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,490
that customers would love to use, right?

86
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,413
So there's a ton of integration

87
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:57,840
that we have put in place
in terms of you want to use,

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,550
you saw the prior presentation as well,

89
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,623
that you want to use,

90
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,040
you know, AWS's Bedrock,

91
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,810
you want to use agentic application.

92
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,130
So this gives you ability

93
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,970
to combine the data from the
Oracle data, Oracle workloads,

94
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,530
and Oracle Exadata,

95
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,830
and then you know, autonomous AI database

96
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,050
with the AWS services

97
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,440
and AI capabilities natively
integrated with one another.

98
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
So when you're building and
modernizing new applications

99
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,270
that need to utilize AI

100
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,820
or need to utilize the
best of breed of, you know,

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,490
kind of both technologies,
this is for the first time,

102
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,480
it's available.

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,000
And the third piece in
addition to integration

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,590
is just like making sure

105
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,200
that we have federated or otherwise,

106
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,660
having all these surrounding services

107
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,910
around operational governance and security

108
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,060
and data protection to be
also available natively

109
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,043
and integrated with AWS.

110
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,980
As the two key players there

111
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,880
that have never ever been done before.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,230
Exadata has been the best
in class hardware technology

113
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,600
for running database services.

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,570
It's the unique technology that allows you

115
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,700
from an enterprise class set of workloads

116
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,700
to have zero RTO, RPO within
region across multiple AZs,

117
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,990
as well as getting to, you know,

118
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,230
near zero asynchronous data guard

119
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,500
and billing active configurations
across the regions.

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,430
So all of these are now available
natively to AWS customers

121
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,960
that would love to utilize both
services across AWS regions

122
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,173
that are operating Oracle workloads.

123
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,150
Again, it's a full
end-to-end feature parity,

124
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,750
performance parity, MA your
architecture of the Oracle,

125
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,710
that technology customer
have used for 30, 40 years,

126
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,356
available natively to them from

127
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:51,060
AWS under Oracle database
at AWS specifically.

128
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,340
Not to confuse with the other services

129
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,460
that are operating on the
commodity hardware and AWS,

130
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,670
but compliments them for the most part.

131
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,710
We have low latency networks built out

132
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,240
into the configuration,

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,000
whereas customers who
were running applications

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,790
and the database tiers
independently of one another,

135
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,140
separately than one another,

136
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,750
these are now operating
from the same data center

137
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,090
with microsecond latency in between.

138
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,240
So as you're thinking about
agentic AI applications,

139
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,650
modernizing your applications

140
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,170
or building new configurations over time,

141
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,810
that latency plays a
very, very unique play

142
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,853
into the horizon going forward.

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,770
Seamless experience, customers
will have the same experience

144
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,400
going to the AWS marketplace
as they do with any

145
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,250
of the other first class AWS services.

146
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,470
They can utilize the AWS PPA

147
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,390
and all the other capabilities and

148
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,700
financial means that are
available to them to procure

149
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,603
and pay for Oracle services
operating natively from AWS.

150
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,880
And then as I indicated,
connecting these services

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,340
to one another is built in natively

152
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,750
into what we have offered.

153
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,640
So I'm gonna stop there,
you know, for a second,

154
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,020
hand over to Avinash from Equifax
to share their experience.

155
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,520
One thing I wanted to share is

156
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
that we launched last year GA,

157
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,310
so this is an enterprise class service

158
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,010
with hundreds and hundreds
of customers already on it.

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,680
We are available in US east, west,

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,020
two AZs, multiple AZs each.

161
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,400
We are launching three more regions

162
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,410
with multiple AZs at the end of this month

163
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,770
where 20 more regions are
aligned with a, you know,

164
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,980
next nine to 10 months to
go live and GA accordingly.

165
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,380
So this is a service
gonna be available in,

166
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,320
and around the world,
everywhere customers need it.

167
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,450
Avinash, take it over. Thank you.

168
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,680
- Hello everybody.

169
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,020
Are you able to hear me? Cool.

170
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,680
So I will talk a little bit about Equifax.

171
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,560
I think most of the people in US at least

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,700
that are using Equifax as one
of the major credit bureau,

173
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,920
we are not just a credit bureau company,

174
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,270
we are a data company.

175
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,370
We have all the consumer data and all.

176
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,250
So why Equifax basically.

177
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,870
So, I mean it's a very loaded slide.

178
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,260
I cannot go everything based
on the given time I have.

179
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,820
So I will just talk a little bit about

180
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,880
how Equifax is using AI and then AWS

181
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,830
and all other cloud provider services.

182
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,400
So Equifax built its own cloud internally,

183
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,290
we call it data fabric layer,

184
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,140
and we harness all the
data of the consumer

185
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,720
and provide the insights of the data

186
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,850
to the consumer for their benefits.

187
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,090
So we are mainly providing
three major services like

188
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,160
employer workforce solution,

189
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,620
US information system solutions,

190
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,390
which is like mortgage services and all.

191
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,460
If you go for any mortgage and all that,

192
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,490
any bank or any lenders,
they use our Equifax services

193
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,503
for all the verifications.

194
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,600
Employment verification.

195
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,980
If you join any company

196
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,810
and you know, a company needs to

197
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,250
do the verification and all,

198
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,630
they use our services.

199
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,400
So Equifax is a lot of services.

200
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,233
These are the major services

201
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,280
which most of the people are aware of.

202
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,900
So I was just talking about that.

203
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,810
So how that all the data that Equifax use

204
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,900
and provide that by
maintaining that Equifax cloud.

205
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,160
So we have that internal
Equifax own design

206
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
for our cloud stuffs to
provide the real time insight,

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,450
multi-data asset at scale,
improved speed and performance.

208
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,020
Because when that, you need or any B2B,

209
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,850
our customer need any data,

210
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,080
their performance and speed
is very important, right?

211
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,160
So there are a lot to talk,
I mean you guys can have

212
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
that access to the slide,
you can read through that.

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,473
Any question always
ready to answer further.

214
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,640
So we are using autonomous database at AWS

215
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
because we have that.

216
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,780
So I support basically
all the enterprise data

217
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,430
and financial systems.

218
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,450
So financial systems consist
of the billing system,

219
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,990
which is very highly
OATP database we need.

220
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,590
So currently we are having
like billions of users' records

221
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,030
come to our system

222
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,010
and then we have to process,

223
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,950
we have the three major billing cycles.

224
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,000
Before the billing cycle,

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,630
we have to rate all the data,
we have to build the data,

226
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,730
create the billing data,
create the invoice,

227
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,870
and ship the invoice.

228
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,880
So it's a very, very always

229
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,260
time constraint related, right?

230
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,230
We need a very high performance
system to perform that,

231
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,970
otherwise that we have a revenue loss.

232
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,040
If that we don't ship the invoices on time

233
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,080
that we will have a revenue loss.

234
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,990
And also that the data
that we cannot, you know,

235
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,150
immediately remove the
data from the system.

236
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,923
So we need a high storage data.

237
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,970
So I mean like this is like a
high level architecture that

238
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,380
how the data comes to the system

239
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,910
and how we process and all that.

240
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,020
Certain points are there

241
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,060
that high volume process,
users processing,

242
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,960
dynamic order management and all that.

243
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,350
So what are the major key benefits

244
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,540
that we are getting using ADB?

245
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,540
So currently that we are
using RDS, RDS Oracle,

246
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,530
definitely very good service.

247
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,360
We have been using since seven years RDS

248
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,740
for BRM system.

249
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,180
Over the seven year period time

250
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,700
that our database is grown like anything.

251
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,910
So we are at the world
of around 64 terabyte.

252
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,503
Good news that yesterday it was announced

253
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:11,280
that we are having the 256
terabyte version of RDS.

254
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,754
But the reason of moving to ADB is,

255
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,800
basically it is sitting in AWS,

256
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,977
using all the infrastructure of ADB,

257
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:22,450
ODB which is sitting in AWS.

258
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,977
So as Kambiz mentioned that,

259
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,920
I mean Exadata is sitting
on the AWS data center.

260
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,010
So my all the application
are sitting in the AWS.

261
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,800
So it's a seamless no latency, no issues,

262
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,580
even if that we want to use
that Exadata service in OCI,

263
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,150
we will have to deal with the
latency between AWS and OCI.

264
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,000
So this is like kind of
a best of the both world.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,370
So I mean like major is optimized

266
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,450
performance and throughput.

267
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,980
If you see that we are like
a very highly OATP systems,

268
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,470
we have to, as I
mentioned, that we have to

269
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,240
do the users on time,

270
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,270
create the billing and
invoices and ship the invoices.

271
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,220
So we need very, very
high performance system,

272
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,283
which underline Exadata is
definitely going to help us.

273
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,210
Scalable storage and data visibility.

274
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,820
So I mean like Exadata provides

275
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,710
that petabytes of storage so we don't have

276
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,470
to worry about storage constraint,

277
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,370
which other database services we have.

278
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,230
For an example that,
currently to manage RDS,

279
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,570
we are having 64 terabyte limitation.

280
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,190
So we have to every quarter purge the data

281
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,680
and then archive the data
whatever we are purging,

282
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,170
because the billing data,
we cannot just purge it.

283
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,790
So we have to maintain a lot of archives

284
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,790
because of that process and limitation.

285
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,652
So with Exadata

286
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:39,690
and the petabytes of the storage capacity,

287
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,490
we don't need to worry about.

288
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,950
And also once that our data grows

289
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,400
in size, Exadata performance will help

290
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,080
to, you know, navigate that data.

291
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,160
If any other service we are
taking for Oracle databases

292
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,210
to run like on-prem

293
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,130
or whatever, we have to do a lot

294
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,900
of maintenance activities for that.

295
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,370
So that is one of the best
benefit we are getting

296
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,290
using this service.

297
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,660
As I mentioned that (indistinct)
unified cloud workload,

298
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,580
because it is sitting with AWS,

299
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,740
we have a lot of AWS
services we are using.

300
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,046
So it is seamless integration,

301
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:16,503
is another key benefit
we are using through ADB.

302
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,063
We also have one important
part is that 23 AI

303
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:27,063
and 26 AI, Oracle AI was
that 26 AI was announced.

304
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,160
So by moving to this that we
are making our data AI ready.

305
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,050
So application has made constant

306
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,790
because we are using
Oracle billing system,

307
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,650
which is (indistinct) product,

308
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,520
it may lag on their
roadmap for AI enablement.

309
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,710
But what we could do by moving to ADB,

310
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,990
we are making our data AI ready

311
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,440
so we can have our own AI
solution sitting on ADB

312
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,717
using Apex and all that which
is available as part of ADB.

313
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,623
So these are the major benefits.

314
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,180
Due to time constraint,

315
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,600
I will just pass it to Kambiz.

316
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,470
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

317
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,530
Hey, thank you Avinash,
really appreciate it.

318
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,920
All right, so there are a bunch of places

319
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,570
you can go to learn more.

320
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,540
Just simply search for Oracle multi-cloud,

321
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,190
search for multi-cloud on Google

322
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,340
or some of the links here that
I'm sure you can remember.

323
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,830
But the video recording will be available

324
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,430
on the AWS website in a couple weeks

325
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,730
and I wanted to dedicate
between Avinash and I,

326
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,900
four, five, six minutes for
any questions you might have.

327
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,720
So there's a microphone out
there if you have questions.

328
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,170
We are here at your disposal.

329
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:39,275
(attendees chatting)

330
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,990
- [Avinash] I should have taken more time.

331
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,820
- [Kambiz] All right, give
you back the two minutes.

332
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,653
Thank you so much.

333
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,796
I appreciate it, thanks
for being here. Bye.

334
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:49,496
- Thank you, Kambiz.
- Thank you.
