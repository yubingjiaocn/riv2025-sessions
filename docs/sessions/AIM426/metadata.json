  "abstract": "Explore the cutting edge of AI with Strands Agents—autonomous systems that evolve and learn continuously. We'll demonstrate advanced agents that can identify knowledge gaps, self-modify reasoning strategies, and dynamically build tools. These systems learn from interactions, improving decision-making without human intervention while communicating through multiple protocols and real-time, bi-directional streaming. Using Strands' model-driven approach, agents operate independently for extended periods, continuously enhancing effectiveness. Through real-world examples, see how self-improving agents have transformed business processes by adapting to changing requirements automatically. Join us to challenge conventional thinking about agent limitations and reshape your approach to building truly autonomous AI systems.",
