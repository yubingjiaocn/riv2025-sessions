1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:02,700
- Welcome to re:Invent 2025.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,897
My name is Umesh Sampat.

3
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:06,930
I'm the director for
training products at AWS.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,076
I'm also enlightened to
welcome my good friend,

5
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,050
Julio Blanco Perez from Santander.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,300
He's gonna share the stage with me today

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,790
and talk about AI skills.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,490
So, Julio, if you wouldn't mind
kinda introducing yourself.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,640
So, he's the acting CTO at Santander.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,550
I'm really excited about the
portion of the presentation

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,860
that Julio is actually gonna deliver today

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,240
'cause it brings home

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,490
a lot of what we wanna talk about.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,400
- Thank you, if you can hear me too,

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,720
everything's all right.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,160
Thank you, Umesh, for having me.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,010
I really thrilled to be here to share

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,120
what we've been doing
for the last two years

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,620
in partnership with AWS.

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,960
- Yeah, no, exciting times ahead.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,820
Like, I was very thrilled

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,360
about what Santander was able to do,

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,860
how they've been able to leverage

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,380
a lot of the, like, mechanisms
that we'll talk about

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,865
in the products that we've built at AWS,

26
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,411
particularly around
upskilling the workforce

27
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:07,350
and they see some really
practical, outstanding results.

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,060
So, looking forward to Julio

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,310
kind of talking a little bit about that

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,433
towards the second part
of the presentation.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,209
So let me kinda start with what is...

32
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,480
like, let me kind of talk a little bit

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,460
about what we'll cover today.

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,620
Largely, we're actually
gonna talk a little bit

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,200
about the challenges and the opportunities

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,360
that exist from AI,

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,370
and particularly around AI upskilling

38
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,970
and why it's important
both for individuals

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,953
as well as for organizations.

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,669
Next, we'll actually
cover how Skill Builder,

41
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,730
how we've evolved Skill Builder,

42
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,870
and how we continue to actually
make Skill Builder available

43
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,700
with AI-powered experiences

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,610
that actually help you achieve

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,950
the AI transformation and AI skilling

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,230
that you're looking for at scale.

47
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,240
And then to bring it home,

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,100
I'll hand the mic over to Julio

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,770
who will walk us through
Santander's story.

50
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,616
So we'll spend about 20, 25 minutes

51
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:10,800
just talking about the problem space

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
and the approach that we're taking.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,550
And then, we'll actually land

54
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,703
with the practical aspect
of Santander's story.

55
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,860
So let me kinda start with a few stats,

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,189
some data just to kind of land

57
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:27,243
the challenge in front of us.

58
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,780
According to the World Economic Forum,

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,150
the jobs report in 2025,

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,640
40% of core job skills

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,950
are expected to change by 2030.

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,410
Just reflect on that for a second.

63
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,470
That's nearly half,

64
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,943
the world's population is
gonna see changes in skills.

65
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,520
It's really interesting
challenge for all of us

66
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,073
and ahead of us, particularly
around upskilling.

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,760
The other statistic that I wanna share

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,810
is AWS ran a research study

69
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,003
across several different organizations.

70
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:10,470
Most of these organizations
that we talked to,

71
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,420
92% of them said

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,940
they plan to have AI projects

73
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,440
either in the works

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,980
or in production by 2028.

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,240
However, three out of four or 75% of them

76
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,690
said that they can't find
the talent that they need.

77
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,790
So there's this really interesting gap

78
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,663
of ambition and capability.

79
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,620
And this is actually really interesting.

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,710
I see some heads nodding in the crowd.

81
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,900
This is a really interesting time

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,793
for all of us around AI upskilling.

83
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,510
The other aspect of this challenge

84
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,670
that makes it a bit more interesting

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,590
and complicated in some ways

86
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,147
is this idea of half-life

87
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:57,420
or skills half-life.

88
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,590
According to Forbes,

89
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,650
this was an article
published in Forbes in 2024.

90
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,880
I still think it's relevant,

91
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,400
so we've included it on the slide.

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,220
The half-life for jobs in the 1980s

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,933
was about 10 years.

94
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,623
In 2024, that was about four.

95
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,740
And the Forbes article
through the Stanford study

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,110
shows that that half-life for skills

97
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,670
could actually be just two years

98
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,920
in the next two to four years.

99
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,840
So what's happening is AI skills

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,120
are evolving pretty quickly,

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,750
and constant continuous learning

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,600
is essentially going to be required,

103
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
no longer a nice to have.

104
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,103
So this is the other aspect
of what we're actually seeing

105
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:45,633
in terms of how the skills
are actually evolving.

106
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,040
Now, we've talked about challenges so far.

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,713
Let's actually talk a bit
about the opportunities.

108
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,770
A study that was done

109
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,100
by Skillsoft IT Skills and Salary Report

110
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,130
indicates that individuals
that possess AI skills

111
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,293
tend to make 47% higher in compensation.

112
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,110
So if you can actually be decisive

113
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,080
about taking control of your career

114
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,144
and your AI skilling

115
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:18,870
and essentially bring AI skilling

116
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,300
as a part of your
professional development,

117
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,940
you have the opportunity
to tap into that premium.

118
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,290
It's not a small descent,
lift in terms of compensation.

119
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,290
So there's a really
interesting mix of challenge

120
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,360
and opportunity that we see

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,373
from a AI skilling standpoint.

122
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,880
So let's talk a little bit

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,833
about how the modern learner's
journey is evolving as well.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,970
Obviously, technical
skills and core skills

125
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,810
have been part of
learning for a long time.

126
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,310
That's not changing.

127
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,990
The foundational aspects

128
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,050
continue to still be incredibly relevant.

129
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,105
However, complementary to
those foundational aspects

130
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:03,829
are human-centric skills.

131
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,570
And generative AI and AI technologies

132
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,310
are actually making it a lot easier

133
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,820
for products like ours, frankly,

134
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,430
that can bring human-centric skills

135
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,133
to complement the
technology-focused skills.

136
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,470
So human-centric skills,

137
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,510
particularly like communication,

138
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,790
critical thinking, relationship building,

139
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,330
these are all integrated into
learning experiences today.

140
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,200
And we'll talk a little bit

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,930
about how Skill Builder has evolved

142
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,690
to support these capabilities.

143
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,690
The other aspect that is changing
quite rapidly is this idea

144
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:43,770
that people don't have time
professionally, personally.

145
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,430
And so taking out two,
three days from your work,

146
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,470
some people can still do it.

147
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,350
But oftentimes, micro learning

148
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,060
is becoming much more of the norm.

149
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,220
It's like 15 minutes,

150
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,900
I have 15 minutes to learn something,

151
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,430
I have a couple hours to learn something.

152
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,210
And so this idea of
transactional learning,

153
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,510
making it fun and engaging
is the other aspect

154
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,950
of what we're actually seeing

155
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,900
the individual's learning journey

156
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,013
and how it's evolving.

157
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,650
So let me reframe the
learning cycle, if you will.

158
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,730
We obviously think of the learning cycle

159
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,410
through the learn lens,

160
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,820
where you're learning concepts,

161
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,670
you practice it to
reinforce your learning,

162
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,520
you prepare for credentials or exams,

163
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,990
and then you basically get,

164
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,790
let's say an AWS certification.

165
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,980
And that's traditionally been sort

166
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,810
of the waterfall approach.

167
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,730
However, what we're actually observing

168
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,990
is that the learn and practice phase

169
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,863
are getting smaller and
much more continuous.

170
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,540
So you learn bursts of concepts,

171
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,540
you practice them in the same experience,

172
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,810
and that actually helps
you go back and forth.

173
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,150
You can actually do this
micro learning thing

174
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,560
back and forth multiple times.

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,690
You learn a concept, you practice it.

176
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,520
You learn the next
concept, you practice it.

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,230
If you need to reinforce
the first concept,

178
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,708
you learn, you can do that.

179
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,130
This also helps you

180
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,800
in the context of what you're working on.

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,380
So while you're actually
solving a problem,

182
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,120
you say, yeah, I need 30 minutes.

183
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,790
I'm actually gonna go learn
a concept, practice it.

184
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,080
And then, come back to my
real work that I'm doing.

185
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,580
And so this idea of micro learning

186
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,100
is becoming much more of the norm.

187
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,360
And it supports this idea

188
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,034
of continuous learning that we saw

189
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,583
previously in terms of
one of the challenges.

190
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,750
Once you've amassed a body of knowledge

191
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,120
and you've accumulated these concepts

192
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,180
across a single domain,

193
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,610
you can actually go
into the prepare phase.

194
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,950
And then, once you actually
have prepared for your exams,

195
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,153
you can get credentials.

196
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,420
So these AI-powered personalization

197
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,903
is really actually helping
a lot of our learners.

198
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,883
So let me dive a little bit
deeper on the learn phase.

199
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,330
AWS Skill Builder provides

200
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,360
330 or so resources and ever-growing

201
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,970
to actually help you grow your AI skills.

202
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,150
And those are a combination
of technical skills

203
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,980
where you learn core concepts

204
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,870
or you can actually go deeper

205
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,960
if you're interested in
learning deeper concepts with AI

206
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,673
as well as human-centric skills.

207
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,490
And so we've actually built products

208
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,690
that bring those experiences together

209
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,860
where you can learn, you can practice,

210
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,570
and you can actually practice both,

211
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,153
technical skills and
human-centered skills.

212
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,750
I'll talk a lot about these products

213
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,850
that you see on the
slide here where it talks

214
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,010
about AI-powered immersive
learning experiences

215
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,190
like SimuLearn or Meeting Simulators.

216
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,464
So I'll cover those in
in a bit more detail

217
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,893
as we walk through the presentation today.

218
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,480
Let's talk about the practice phase.

219
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,560
If you're interested in building a role

220
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,300
or industry expertise,

221
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,380
we have a series of products

222
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,060
that actually help you do that.

223
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,050
For example, top left,
you see Cloud Quest.

224
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,690
Cloud Quest is a 3D game product

225
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,140
where you can actually
learn cloud concepts

226
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,140
in essentially a game-based
learning experience.

227
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,510
You can try out a variety of AWS services

228
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,073
in the same game,

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,020
and you can actually learn
concepts, practice it,

230
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,270
solve the quest, go to the next one,

231
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,770
and so on.

232
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,220
So these experiences around
micro learning are built in

233
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,503
to essentially the Skill
Builder product set.

234
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,920
Similarly, if you're just
interested in reading,

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,620
like looking at labs,

236
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,430
you can actually go and
practice a lot of the concepts

237
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,430
within Builder Labs or Jam sessions.

238
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,650
These are, again, products that help you

239
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,290
practice what you've actually learned

240
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,353
in a real AWS environment.

241
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,780
You can develop communications

242
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,670
and human-centric skills

243
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,147
through products like Meeting
Simulator and SimuLearn.

244
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,070
And then, the other aspect

245
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,220
of what we've actually
learned with practice

246
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,258
is group-based learning,

247
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:24,977
where you can actually use Card Clash,

248
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,500
which is essentially a game-based product

249
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,860
that helps you go head
to head with individuals

250
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,070
and you can actually learn
in a group-based format.

251
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,890
So again, these learn and
practice experiences are built

252
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,713
right into the product set
with AWS Skill Builder.

253
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,230
Let's take a look at some of
the products that I mentioned

254
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,730
slightly in more depth as we
walk through the presentation.

255
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,090
So Cloud Quest generative AI practitioner,

256
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,140
it's primarily designed

257
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,573
for someone interested
in foundational skills.

258
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,060
But essentially, you
are in a 3D virtual city

259
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,590
and you take...

260
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,340
you're actually learning
from guided experiences

261
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,813
that are built into the game.

262
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,616
You go through recommendations

263
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:16,080
and you actually try
out your recommendations

264
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,240
in real-world AWS environments

265
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,760
right there in that experience.

266
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,260
So it's bringing learning and practicing

267
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,610
all within the entire-

268
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,220
in essentially the same experience.

269
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,440
And so you learn and you
get hands-on experience

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,380
with Amazon Bedrock, with SageMaker,

271
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,030
with Q Developer,

272
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,740
and the list goes on.

273
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,573
You can also learn

274
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:42,330
about essentially foundational
models, prompt engineering,

275
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,740
you can learn about RAG
implementation concepts and so on.

276
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,128
And this is an ever-growing
list of capabilities

277
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:51,600
that we're adding continuously.

278
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,680
I mentioned with Skill Builder,

279
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,750
we have 330 such resources.

280
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,390
We continuously add to them

281
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,790
as new technology comes out.

282
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,570
If you're not quite friendly

283
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,080
to a 3D-based game type learning format,

284
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,510
we have SimuLearn.

285
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,210
Essentially, SimuLearn is mimicking

286
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,100
a real-world scenario for you.

287
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
So it's a simulated learning experience

288
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,263
where you engage with
AI-powered virtual agents.

289
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,490
And essentially, you are
gathering requirements,

290
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,220
you're developing
architectural recommendations,

291
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,940
you're providing essentially
proposals to AI agents.

292
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,820
And these agents are
actually providing you

293
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,560
feedback on two things:

294
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,770
One is the technical skills
that you're learning,

295
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,720
the other is the human-centered skills,

296
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,100
particularly around communication.

297
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,270
So you get the entire feedback
right within the context

298
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,340
of the simulated learning environment.

299
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,900
So it's a nifty experience.

300
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,310
And what we've noticed

301
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,430
is like when we look at engagement data,

302
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,490
particularly with Cloud
Quest and with SimuLearn,

303
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,790
our engagement numbers with
learners is incredibly high

304
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,970
when compared to traditional
digital learning formats

305
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,110
because you're actually bringing

306
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,720
these two experiences together

307
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,490
in a micro learning format.

308
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,480
And by the way, it's perfect

309
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,200
for either you're starting off

310
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,580
or you're actually developing

311
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,440
advanced architectural concepts.

312
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,530
We have a ton of different
courses in SimuLearn

313
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,470
that actually specifically cover

314
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,453
generative AI architecture plans.

315
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,500
Next I wanna talk about Meeting Simulator.

316
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,006
This is a super interesting launch.

317
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:33,755
We launched this product not too long ago,

318
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:36,183
November 12th, just last month.

319
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,260
And this is actually primarily focused

320
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,423
on developing human-centered skills.

321
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,190
So it simulates real-world,
high-stakes conversations

322
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,753
through voice or text.

323
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,090
So again, it's fascinating.

324
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,070
This is where we've actually leveraged AI

325
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,800
and generative AI technologies

326
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,800
to improve and make our
learning products better,

327
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,180
but also we're actually leveraging them

328
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,673
to teach AI and AI concepts.

329
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,620
So in this case,

330
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,558
you can actually simulate
practical scenarios.

331
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:13,380
So for example, you can simulate scenarios

332
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,800
where you're discussing cost
conversations with the CFO

333
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,110
and the agent persona goes back and forth

334
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,090
and gives you real-time feedback

335
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,890
on how you're communicating.

336
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,810
So if you're essentially preparing

337
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,490
for a technical sales role

338
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,233
or you're preparing for
stakeholder type roles,

339
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,953
this product would actually
be perfect for you.

340
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,250
Next, once you've amassed

341
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,330
sufficient body of knowledge

342
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,820
where you've gone back and
forth with micro learning,

343
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,640
you can prepare for certification exams.

344
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,747
And we've made preparation

345
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,110
for the certification exams quite easy.

346
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,940
You get to know your exam,

347
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,893
you refresh your skills,

348
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,153
you can review and practice
through exam-style questions.

349
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,410
And then like essentially self-assess,

350
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,010
are you ready to take an
AWS certification or not?

351
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,860
These certifications tend
to be several hours long

352
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,380
with multiple choice
questions back and forth.

353
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,840
So going through a preparation phase

354
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,063
actually helps individuals.

355
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,570
Now, before I dive into
what are the specific

356
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,430
AI/ML certifications that we
have published or launched,

357
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,613
I wanna talk a little bit

358
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,673
about why certifications are important.

359
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,493
Remember the 47% compensation
bump that I talked about?

360
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,340
Knowing the skills is one thing,

361
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,430
but having the credentials on your resume

362
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,990
helps you overcome

363
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,560
because it actually validates
for prospective employers

364
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,040
that you actually know the AI skills.

365
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,048
The other aspect is and
these are some stats

366
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,890
that I'll kinda share more broadly,

367
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,510
it's about a million
unique individuals today

368
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,180
over a million that
possess AWS certifications,

369
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,980
and some of them possess
multiple certifications.

370
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,570
So it's actually quite
popular amongst individuals,

371
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,663
but also frankly amongst
prospective employers.

372
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,420
We actually ran a study
and we asked organizations,

373
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,370
do these certifications mean a lot?

374
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,280
And I know Julio will talk
a little bit about this

375
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,020
with Santander as well.

376
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,310
But interestingly enough,

377
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,880
91% of the organizations we spoke to

378
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,300
said that having AWS-certified staff

379
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,553
increased innovation in their companies.

380
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,020
Also 90% plus

381
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,050
said that they were able to reduce costs.

382
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,270
So we see both innovative

383
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,470
and productivity gains for organizations

384
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,960
when you actually are hiring individuals

385
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,990
with AWS certifications.

386
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,010
Now let me talk a little bit

387
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,100
about the four
certifications that we have.

388
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,745
We have in a total of
about 12 certifications.

389
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:11,430
AI Practitioner Foundational,

390
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,861
it's sort of validating

391
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:15,663
that you know foundational concepts in AI.

392
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,900
Machine Learning Engineer Associate

393
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,230
is actually really
validating that you know

394
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,370
essentially machine learning

395
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,810
and deep learning concepts;

396
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,330
model tuning, those types of things.

397
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,179
Data Engineer Associate is
a really interesting one.

398
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:35,070
Oftentimes to get agentic
applications built,

399
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,100
data and data pipelines
are incredibly important.

400
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,330
And so data engineer
associate helps validate

401
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,760
essentially the data
pipelines are in place

402
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,850
and your set up to build
those agentic applications.

403
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,370
And then, we're proud to announce

404
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,267
on November 18th the beta version

405
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:54,855
of Generative AI Professional.

406
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:58,297
So this is a developer
certification that helps validate

407
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:01,740
that you can actually
build agentic applications.

408
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,010
So we're excited with
these certifications.

409
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,900
And just so you know,
machine learning engineer

410
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,360
and data engineer have
been around for some time,

411
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,170
but they've been updated
with more recent questions

412
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,170
and essentially skills that
validate agentic capabilities.

413
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,770
We've also heard from
a lot of our learners

414
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,040
that taking these
certifications can be onerous.

415
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,760
And so we are excited to, again, announce

416
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,373
that we launched microcredentials.

417
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:38,100
These microcredentials are
actually incredibly valuable

418
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,540
'cause they actually
provide real-time assessment

419
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,820
in real AWS environments.

420
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,730
Unlike certifications that have Q&A

421
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,560
where they're testing your knowledge,

422
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,223
these microcredentials actually
validate hands-on skills.

423
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,080
So your assessments are actually
within AWS environments,

424
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,510
and you can prove that not only you know

425
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,370
the concept in theory,

426
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,555
but you actually know how to operate

427
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:07,230
those services at scale.

428
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,127
Currently we have two that
we launched on November 12th:

429
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,740
AWS Agentic AI Demonstrated

430
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,080
and AWS Serverless Demonstrated.

431
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,930
These complement our
certifications really well.

432
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,580
And they actually go hand in hand

433
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,950
with the concept of micro learning.

434
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,320
So now imagine you learn,

435
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,930
you practice, you validate,

436
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,430
and you do it in smaller chunks

437
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,510
and you rinse and repeat

438
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,120
and you're essentially amassing

439
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,463
a body of knowledge continuously.

440
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,460
So that's kind of a bit of a recap

441
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,190
of the individual journey

442
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,530
where we talked about learn and practice

443
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,973
getting closer one another.

444
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,180
Preparation for exams
becomes part of the journey

445
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,860
after you've actually gone back and forth

446
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,270
with learn and practice.

447
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,078
With microcredentials, you can do

448
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,560
a certain percentage of validations

449
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,693
in that learn and practice phase.

450
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,810
And then, validate actually is either

451
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,300
through microcredentials
or certifications.

452
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,500
So that's your path as an
individual to AI career

453
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,850
and hopefully the success
that comes behind it.

454
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:22,590
Now, now that we've
talked about individuals,

455
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,123
let's actually talk about what
happens within organizations.

456
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,120
One of the most powerful ways
we believe to build culture

457
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,730
is through collaborative
team-based learning.

458
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,230
And Julio will talk about this,

459
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,420
like, I'm really excited about his talk,

460
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,240
where he brings this together.

461
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,000
But essentially, we've
built a series of products

462
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,273
that actually help collaborative
team-based learning.

463
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,640
Remember I mentioned Cloud Quest,

464
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,150
which was essentially the
3D game for individuals?

465
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,810
There's Cloud Quest
tournaments for organizations.

466
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,250
So it's really open-ended.

467
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,460
You learn, you solve problems together

468
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,180
in real-world AWS environments as teams

469
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,300
competing against one
another in a healthy way

470
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,000
and you actually get the
engagement at the team level.

471
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:15,990
AWS Jams have been around for some time.

472
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,500
These are open-ended lab-based problems

473
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,300
where teams get together

474
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,760
and actually solve real-world challenges.

475
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,845
There's leaderboards, you can
actually see who's doing what.

476
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,940
You can set up your own
challenges that you'd like.

477
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,640
So again, super interesting way

478
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,731
to actually get engagement
across your teams.

479
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,680
AWS Card Clash,

480
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,460
it's a game-based app that we've built.

481
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,320
You can actually test your knowledge

482
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,603
head to head with other individuals.

483
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,000
It helps to learn,

484
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,550
but it also helps to
reinforce what you've learned.

485
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,110
Escape Room is really,
really popular one too.

486
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,210
Escape Rooms are actually group-based

487
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,370
certification exam preparations.

488
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,320
So if you've been in a
physical escape room,

489
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,170
it's a similar concept, it's virtual.

490
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,180
And you can essentially go,

491
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,390
you can actually solve problems together,

492
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,140
learn for actually certifications.

493
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,320
And once you actually get
from one room to another,

494
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,140
you're actually doing it in a
group-based learning format.

495
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,980
So it's fun to kinda
get prepared for an exam

496
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,600
in a group-based format.

497
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,270
And then lastly, Skill Builder Trivia.

498
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,610
It's another way to
actually reinforce knowledge

499
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,180
through large-scale team competition.

500
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,680
Now a lot of these formats

501
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,620
are actually available at re:Invent.

502
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,300
So I'll talk a little bit

503
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,610
about exactly where you'll find them.

504
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,340
So if you really want to
experience them firsthand,

505
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,899
they're present across several venues

506
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,593
here at re:Invent '25.

507
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,180
Let me talk about one more launch

508
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,540
that we had on November
12th called Cohort Studio

509
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,200
before I hand the mic over to Julio.

510
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,750
But Cohort Studio, essentially,

511
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,000
one of the feedback that we had received

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
from a lot of our customers,

513
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,743
and particularly in partnership
with Santander even,

514
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,250
essentially bringing a lot
of these experiences together

515
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,442
in multiple of these experiences,

516
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:22,470
like SimuLearn or, you know, Card Clash,

517
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,175
or Jams, et cetera

518
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:28,020
together in a single experience

519
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,910
was a problem for a lot of our customers,

520
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,400
particularly when they
were actually looking

521
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,550
to launch team-based learning

522
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,930
within their organization.

523
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,550
So with Cohort Studio,

524
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,430
anyone can launch a cohort program

525
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,173
in less than 15 minutes.

526
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,150
It's AI-powered.

527
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,320
You can pick and choose the
experiences that I talked about

528
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,210
and you can drive engagement

529
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,773
and teamwork and recognition.

530
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,830
Whether you're trying to
organize a certification exam

531
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,730
or you're actually trying to
get AI skills bootcamps ready

532
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,190
or you're actually looking
at team competitions,

533
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,080
you can actually do that in Cohort Studio.

534
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,243
So we're very excited about this launch

535
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:12,090
and I have to thank like Santander

536
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,880
to, like, helping us actually figure out

537
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,280
and visualize what this
product would look like.

538
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,243
With that, let me hand
the mic over to Julio.

539
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,280
I'm really excited.

540
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,385
He's the acting CTO,
again, of Santander Bank

541
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:31,385
and he's gonna walk you
through how Santander took over

542
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,100
some of the mechanisms and
products that we've talked about

543
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,570
and made it real and actually
ran a program at scale

544
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,010
in a financial services company.

545
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,910
Thank you, Julio.
- Thank you, Umesh.

546
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,100
Hello, everybody again.

547
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,250
I will first try to introduce Santander

548
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,430
because I don't know if
everybody knows Santander.

549
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,615
But it's a bank of 180 years of history

550
00:25:56,615 --> 00:26:00,129
and that is really relevant
when we are talking

551
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:03,816
about cloud and AI

552
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:06,180
for scaling training

553
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,600
because we are a traditional bank

554
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
and we are a global bank

555
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,650
and we are dealing with
products that deals

556
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,310
with individual from individuals
to huge corporations.

557
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,160
So we have a portfolio product that cover

558
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,710
nearly everything that you
think about in banking,

559
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,860
probably we have a
product that cover that.

560
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,440
We have nearly 200 million customers

561
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,430
and nearly 2 billion
euros in managed assets.

562
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,740
And also we are partnered
with AWS since 2018

563
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,990
to scale the way that we deal

564
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,240
with our customers.

565
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,364
We're like to introduce ourself

566
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:52,830
as a digital bank with branches.

567
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,630
So technology is embedded

568
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,720
and should be embedded
in everything that we do,

569
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,220
but we also think that
branches gives a lot of power

570
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,392
and a lot of reach depending on the people

571
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,053
that we are dealing with.

572
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,460
So really engaging this hybrid approach

573
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,860
between a full digital bank

574
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,850
and a traditional bank

575
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,580
that has relationship through branches.

576
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,606
And even if we are a
digital global company,

577
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:24,450
we are focusing here of a program

578
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,240
that we launched two years ago in Brazil.

579
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,980
So everything from here

580
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,520
to the end of the
presentation is Brazil-based.

581
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,549
And we are trying to think
about how to you scale it

582
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:36,993
throughout the company.

583
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,893
So what's AWS Level UP?

584
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm taking some words
from Umesh' presentation

585
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,700
that traditional learning
is not working anymore.

586
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,210
At least from our point of
view in a big enterprise,

587
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,130
launching lots of mandatory
training does not scale.

588
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,850
People don't want to be
three days in a classroom

589
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,280
with people of different levels.

590
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,130
So in the end, you don't
get the things that you want

591
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,283
that everybody on board that
everybody want to be learning.

592
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,033
But we also don't really see

593
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:22,010
that we are there in terms
of you as a employee,

594
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:30,719
manage your own training
program by yourself,

595
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,670
getting into Skill Builder,

596
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,890
trying to build everything that you need

597
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,760
to be able to be certified.

598
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,230
So when we thought

599
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,230
about how we will be scaling our program,

600
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,270
we mixed everything together.

601
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,510
So Level UP,

602
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,003
it's just like a progression game,

603
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,220
but we have rules,

604
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,920
we have paths,

605
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,970
we have accountancy,

606
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,267
we have three-to-nine months expectation

607
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:11,703
depending of the
complexity of the courses.

608
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,293
And we designed it with
AWS because, you know,

609
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,785
they know a lot

610
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:21,120
about their own platform

611
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,390
and we mix our needs

612
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:28,020
and our paths for certification

613
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,523
with their knowledge.

614
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,750
So more or less, how it works?

615
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,367
When you get onboarded,

616
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,143
you are assigned with a study group

617
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:44,850
that more or less fits your knowledge

618
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,710
and what certification

619
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,423
you're gonna get.

620
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,403
And then, you're also
onboarded on Skill Builder.

621
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,560
So you have a clear path
of where your next train,

622
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,610
but you are also able
to do it by yourself.

623
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,810
You can get courses from
outside of your learning path.

624
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,770
But what I'm saying,

625
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,213
you have a cadence.

626
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,976
People around you,

627
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,730
asking questions about the next training,

628
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,100
asking if you got...

629
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,000
you are up to the training path.

630
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,080
So everybody is trying,

631
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,340
is pushing the other
members of the team forward.

632
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,740
We started seeing that
this is not something

633
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,000
that we planned for, right?

634
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,740
We started seeing along the way

635
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,730
that people started pushing each other

636
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,040
because of the badges,

637
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,000
because of it's not a real gamification,

638
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,480
we don't have a leadership,

639
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,580
but you can see how other people

640
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,900
in your study group are going.

641
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,850
So in the end, you have
a little gamification.

642
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,850
We didn't want a full
gamification without leadership,

643
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,870
a champion in the end

644
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,480
because we wanted everybody to go on board

645
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,030
and everybody to put in pushing

646
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,355
for the training to go over.

647
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:05,820
And we also,

648
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,553
and I will be explaining you some slides,

649
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,670
you know, in a few slides,

650
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,240
we thought about how we were doing

651
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,030
to have something different

652
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,040
for the people that went to the end

653
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,093
and got certified.

654
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,100
We created what we call an AWS experience

655
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,630
with kind of re:Invent

656
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,980
and our certified people
can have a VIP lounge.

657
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,093
Lots of things over there.

658
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,920
They are different T-shirt,

659
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,450
they can show all over the organization

660
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,350
that they are certified.

661
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,910
So they're kind of our VIP guys

662
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,503
for the party.

663
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,610
So what I'm saying,

664
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,353
we created a framework.

665
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,726
So we created that kind

666
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:58,611
of progression system

667
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:01,110
throughout the process.

668
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,900
So even we have lots of different parts

669
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,930
for AI certifications,

670
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,160
for cloud practitioners,

671
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,470
for solution architects.

672
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,700
They have different paths,

673
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,001
but in the end everything goes

674
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:17,070
through the same way,
through the same road.

675
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,803
So different study groups,

676
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,480
we have a hard schedule.

677
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,243
So if you are going to be certified,

678
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,540
not certified, but going to the end

679
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,310
of the training in three months,

680
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,110
we schedule several
trainings along the way,

681
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,070
but we expect you

682
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,906
to go forward on your own self-paced,

683
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:47,300
but you will be, you know...

684
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,903
Everybody will see that you
are not doing your training

685
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,580
with your own group,

686
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,580
which was something
really, really interesting.

687
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,170
And what are we saying?

688
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,920
More effective communication

689
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,490
was starting to come up

690
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,960
through all the teams

691
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,340
that this is something that created

692
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,390
a kind of speed of community

693
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,930
that didn't have before.

694
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,450
We had other ways of training people.

695
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,700
We had lots of AWS training.

696
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,700
We had invested a lot in training,

697
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,652
not only with AWS,

698
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:28,720
but we wouldn't get the same results

699
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,790
until we got up this mixed system

700
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,840
that, I think, that we
reach the sweet spot

701
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,420
between mandatory things

702
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,080
and feeling free

703
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,623
to go after knowledge.

704
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,863
So let me switch a little bit over here.

705
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,450
If you are a tech worker
in Santander, Brazil,

706
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,253
something from someone
for our development teams,

707
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,710
what would you see when you start

708
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,820
your journey, you're onboarded?

709
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,390
You register in our portal,

710
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,440
in our learning portal.

711
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,900
It's available for many other things

712
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,743
and you are enrolled
inside AWS Skill Builder.

713
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,780
So that's, you know, the
more traditional thing.

714
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,849
You'll go over there,

715
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,120
you are onboarded.

716
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,300
But then other things along the path

717
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,353
are assigned to you.

718
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,390
You are assigned, for example,

719
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,250
for a cloud west tournament

720
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,113
and people go together,

721
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,500
play together to resolve

722
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,913
all that different scenarios.

723
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,930
We also have training
sessions from Skill Builder

724
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:52,830
that are more or less sync
for that particular team.

725
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,950
We also have traditional

726
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,173
what we call outlaws in Portuguese,

727
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,990
a big classroom,

728
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,090
which is the sync part of the training.

729
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,380
Everybody goes there for some day

730
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,850
for some specific topic.

731
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:13,850
So we are not abandoning
traditional learning

732
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,400
because there are some
people from the team

733
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,400
that don't really get that
micro learning strategy.

734
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:24,030
They're not there.

735
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,990
So as we want everybody to go forward,

736
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,253
we mixed everything up.

737
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,680
Then, we got everybody
to practice their sums.

738
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,970
You use SimuLearn,

739
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,300
they use other platforms

740
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:39,300
to simulate the sums.

741
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,150
And then, we are ready, they pass.

742
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,526
We have some evaluations

743
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:48,423
for all the results they got.

744
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,960
They are given the AWS voucher

745
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,373
to go for the certification.

746
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,420
And then when everything is finished,

747
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,560
as we are saying,

748
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,750
it's a fixed timeline.

749
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,633
At the end of the three
months, six months,

750
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,023
or nine months project,

751
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,090
we have a closing session

752
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,754
when we have some pricing,

753
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,870
giveaways from devices

754
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,790
or whatever that only the
people that got certified

755
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,080
can get the prices.

756
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,080
So it's the last mile gamification.

757
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,940
It's not really big money,

758
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,610
but you know that everybody
wants to go in the stage

759
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,263
and get the device.

760
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,670
That was from the point of view

761
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,900
of a person.

762
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,705
But from the point of
view of the organization,

763
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:50,010
you can really see that we got thousands

764
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,910
of people onboarded

765
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,710
in our training,

766
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,370
and hundreds of them
being able to complete,

767
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,330
even to certify,

768
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:05,330
we had nearly 120 certifications

769
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,590
when we began the this project.

770
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,590
So from 100 to 700, it's huge.

771
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,390
It's a huge-

772
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,470
and we also saw

773
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,990
that kind of change

774
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,620
in how training

775
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,900
was being misunderstood

776
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,850
because training was
that mandatory training,

777
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,000
everything the HR wanted people to do

778
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,630
and your manager will go after you

779
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,370
if you didn't complete your training

780
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,423
during that period.

781
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,400
And we started seeing
more people going together

782
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,580
and discussing about how to get the best

783
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,413
from the tooling

784
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:54,460
that we are giving to them

785
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:56,861
and start seeing

786
00:37:56,861 --> 00:38:01,861
that complete tooling being
used in other use cases,

787
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,290
that special teams wanted

788
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,250
more advanced classes, ILT classrooms

789
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,027
because they something

790
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:12,450
in their path was not covered

791
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,930
and they really wanted that

792
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,700
for their day-to-day job.

793
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,550
So it really changed

794
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,420
the way that we manage training

795
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,053
throughout the last two years.

796
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,523
And as I was saying,

797
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,650
was three years ago,

798
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,910
some of our executives

799
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,483
were coming back from re:Invent to Brazil,

800
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:48,120
and they just start saying,

801
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,300
why don't we try to organize

802
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,280
and experience like
re:Invent there in Brazil?

803
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,890
So we partnered with AWS,

804
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,337
another and another partners of us.

805
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:04,410
And we started re:Invent,

806
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:09,270
which Santander AWS experience,

807
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,120
which what I'm saying,

808
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,300
it explode the way that
we felt about training

809
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,290
because we have 2021

810
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,273
last time.

811
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,140
In October, we got 21
talks level 200, level 300,

812
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,660
as we have lots of people trained,

813
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,830
we didn't have to have L100 sessions.

814
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,470
We tried to push to rise the bar

815
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,853
and have more quality paths.

816
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:47,333
We have different paths.

817
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:52,333
We have AI path, we have
databases path, architecture,

818
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,320
so I cannot say it's the same as re:Invent

819
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,457
because there are lots of things together,

820
00:39:56,457 --> 00:40:01,457
but we have three to four
different talks at the same time.

821
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,350
We also, this year, we
also got the DeepRacer

822
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,020
inside our, in the
middle of our open space,

823
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,020
so the teams that won for the final

824
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,380
got a lot of public throughout the office

825
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,790
because everybody was
in the same building.

826
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,260
So, you know, we also got escape rooms

827
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,980
and exam preparations
through the three days.

828
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,340
So escape room is usually digital.

829
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,900
We got everybody in the same room

830
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,290
and try to get together

831
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,883
to go to manage to exit.

832
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,230
We make some jokes about that we are going

833
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,290
to close the door,

834
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,020
and they are only going out if they can.

835
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,243
You can't really finish the challenge.

836
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,620
So what I'm saying is and in the end,

837
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,330
we also got a big party,

838
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,080
but I said the people that were certified

839
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,513
are the ones that go in the VIP session

840
00:41:00,513 --> 00:41:04,650
that was in the middle of the parties.

841
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,060
So they have different things,
different booth, whatever,

842
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,060
whatever we thought about
having people gamified thing

843
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,050
without having to create a leaderboard

844
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,590
because if you are useful
in a gamification program,

845
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,770
only the ones that are in
the front are really engaged,

846
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,000
but get in the middle and get
in the end, you lose them.

847
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,550
We wanted everybody on board.

848
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,460
So that's what, even in the
last day, if you got certified,

849
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,990
you go there with your certification

850
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,160
even it's not in the system,

851
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,673
people got the T-shirt
and go into the party.

852
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,743
And that gives us something like this.

853
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,593
As more people got trained, cloud and AI,

854
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,520
we can do things in an easy
way that they wouldn't before.

855
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,850
So we got a problem inside
of our advising organization.

856
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,660
They got stuck trying to
have the correct pitch

857
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,940
for our customers.

858
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,090
They spend more time
preparing the conversation

859
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,850
than having that conversation
with our customers.

860
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:25,260
So we helped also with help AWS

861
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,300
and we got some stack.

862
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,393
We use AWS stack to get
everything together,

863
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,670
but we transform,

864
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,210
change completely the
way our advisors works.

865
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,530
Now they spend nearly
30 seconds to one minute

866
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,030
to prepare that pitch

867
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,250
because we got everything prepared

868
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,570
for them in our knowledge base,

869
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,850
so all the products of
the Vanguard catalog there

870
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,342
with a relative returns, risk, whatever,

871
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:56,370
and they can adapt the pitch
for more depth conversation

872
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,540
for that kind of client.

873
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,127
For other clients, it's a
not so deep conversation

874
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,660
and we need a more formal approach

875
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,783
so they can tune many
things on the project.

876
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,020
And the results, you
can see it already there

877
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,780
and I'm passing through all the results,

878
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,780
but we increase nearly 1.2 times increase

879
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,780
in customer contact.

880
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,400
And not only that that
it's just a project,

881
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,400
but it was our first initiative
that went through, you know,

882
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,220
a compressed space of time.

883
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,100
We experimented it, we launched it,

884
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,390
and changed completely the
way one of our main areas

885
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:44,390
of growth in Brazil is using their time,

886
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:50,060
so trying to wrap up everything.

887
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,320
We truly believe that there's a transition

888
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,410
to a new way of training inside companies,

889
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,240
especially big ones

890
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,073
that are more mandate-based tradition

891
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,130
of dealing with learning.

892
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,200
We believe that lifelong learning is here

893
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,253
to be here forever.

894
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,350
But we also recognized
that our team was not ready

895
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,700
for a self-pa-

896
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,920
I don't know if some time,

897
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,690
they will be ready for a
full self-paced experience.

898
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,690
So that's was our way of mixing
some things from the past,

899
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,590
like we are 180-years history bank

900
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,190
with top-notch technology
like Skill Builder

901
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,453
to be able to have everything together.

902
00:44:49,922 --> 00:44:50,755
And I'm gonna say,

903
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:55,730
so I will thank you Umesh
for having that time

904
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,610
to share our story.

905
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,623
And I give the word to you.
- Oh.

906
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,135
Thank you so much Julio.

907
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:09,135
What an amazing story, like,
just look at how a project,

908
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,610
and then look at some of the outcomes

909
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,920
both in terms of their learning

910
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,900
and how they accomplish the skills,

911
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,180
but also how they applied those skills

912
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,390
in a production context within
their business application,

913
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,040
so super exciting story.

914
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,480
I want to thank Julio for
joining me on on stage today.

915
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,260
So we're towards the end of
our presentation somewhere,

916
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,430
another two more minutes,

917
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,223
and then we're happy to
basically take questions.

918
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,350
In terms of next steps,
here for individuals,

919
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:45,087
you have access to over
1000 learning resources.

920
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,500
For individuals, you can
go to Skill Builder at AWS,

921
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,020
there's also 330 plus trainings on AI,

922
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,150
you can launch them today.

923
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,160
For organizational leaders,

924
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,500
upscale your workforce at scale.

925
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,760
A lot of these capabilities

926
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,483
that we talk about exist
today in Skill Builder.

927
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:09,180
Some AI learning spotlight options here,

928
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,890
so if you wanna take a few minutes

929
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,323
to just grab a screen print.

930
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,920
Essentially, there's
Generative AI Learning Plans

931
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,390
for Decision Makers.

932
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,940
There's Generative AI
Learning Plans for Developers

933
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,953
that includes the practical aspects,

934
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,360
Quick Suite Learning Plan,
Agentic AI Learning Plan.

935
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,490
So there's several
different learning options

936
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,834
across the 330, we've just picked a few

937
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:34,653
to highlight up here.

938
00:46:35,857 --> 00:46:39,060
And I wanna kind of end
our presentation today

939
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,213
with get building agreement.

940
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,610
You can actually take your
AWS cloud AI expertise

941
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,030
to the next level, just
in your mobile app,

942
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,863
in mobile app,

943
00:46:51,863 --> 00:46:54,960
you can plug in training and certification

944
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,210
and it'll show you a variety of these.

945
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,690
And many of these actually
don't require registrations,

946
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,302
you can just walk in.

947
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:05,163
So you can take boot
camps, spotlight labs.

948
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,830
There's essentially
the gamified challenges

949
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,010
that we've talked about, AWS Jam sessions,

950
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,833
SimuLearn, Escape Room, et cetera.

951
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,433
There's breakout sessions
throughout the conference.

952
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,630
And the trivia app that we talked about,

953
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,970
if you take shuttle buses between venues,

954
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,950
you can actually see it
in the shuttle buses.

955
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,640
So we've tried to bring in a
lot of the learning experiences

956
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,550
right within the conference this year.

957
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:36,360
So really excited in terms
of what we have to offer.

958
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,945
Hopefully, the session was useful

959
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:43,200
to kind of talk about the shift,

960
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,580
A, we talked about the challenges,

961
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,290
the opportunity in front of us.

962
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,630
We also talked about
the shift in learning,

963
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,830
continuous being much more of,
not no longer nice to have,

964
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,090
but much more of a requirement

965
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,570
given how quickly the
technology is evolving.

966
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,540
And then, the product
set that we're building

967
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,780
and customers like
Santander are able to use

968
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,450
and personalize it to their needs.

969
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,680
So hopefully, the session was helpful,

970
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,265
please leave us some feedback.

971
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,815
We're happy to take questions.

972
00:48:11,815 --> 00:48:14,581
Logistically, what we were told was,

973
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:18,180
we're actually gonna walk
over in that area back there.

974
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,590
We have about 10 minutes.

975
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,670
Julio and myself will be there

976
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,440
for at least 10 or 15 minutes.

977
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,460
Happy to take questions,

978
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,890
I don't know how the format would work

979
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:26,760
with the headphones on,

980
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,130
so we're gonna venture over in that area

981
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,110
and happy to talk to folks.

982
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,741
Thank you so very much,
enjoy the conference.

983
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:35,588
(audience applauding)
