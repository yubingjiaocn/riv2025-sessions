1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,528
- Hey, everybody. Thanks
for joining today.

2
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:05,010
This is a presentation
from a company I'm with

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,690
called Island, and I
can't wait to show you.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,910
This is a very game changing technology.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,070
We're doing some really great stuff

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,930
with something called
the Enterprise Browser.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,610
And if you've never heard of what that is,

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,960
you're gonna learn a bit about it.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,010
You're also gonna understand

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,040
kind of how we helped
Amazon on the .com side,

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,703
do some really revolutionary
things, specifically with AI.

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,580
And unfortunately, my co-presenter, Adam,

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,600
could not make it today.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,720
So it's just gonna be me
as we go through this.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,270
And we will have some
time for some questions

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,340
if anybody would like to have, you know,

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,900
understand a little bit
more about what this is.

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,520
Obviously, our booth is back there,

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,700
but we're gonna have a roaming
mic as well for questions,

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,010
and there will be time
for questions as well.

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,050
So, what is the big deal?

22
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,460
What is the challenge here today?

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,390
Well, the challenge is that
we have these AI agents

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,430
that can do a lot of stuff,

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,280
but we need to make sure
it's governed in a good way.

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,980
And so today, you know,
we are thinking about

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,660
the data governance that
goes along with that.

28
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,590
It's nothing, you know.

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,540
You can do basically whatever you want.

30
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,390
The data, the sensitive
data goes right in.

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,520
There's really not a lot
of governance to that.

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,510
Data comes back out.

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,760
And then we start talking
about agentic AI, right?

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,320
So when it's doing things.

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,700
And it's really nice when it does things

36
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,120
for you from a personal
consumer type way, right?

37
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Maybe you give it your, I don't
know, your OpenTable login

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,100
and it does a reservation, that's cute.

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,720
But then when we bring
that into the business,

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,130
we need different controls.

41
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,600
We need different governance around it.

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,370
So, what we're gonna talk about today

43
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,200
is that control in that security

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,680
and making sure it's reliable

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,060
and some use cases that Amazon found

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,790
that really helped them
drive some true value

47
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,640
and some cost savings
within their enterprise.

48
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,060
So, first, if you haven't heard
about what this category is,

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,400
it's probably the most exciting
thing I've seen in tech

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,233
for a long time.

51
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,710
I've been in tech for a long time.

52
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,700
This is super exciting.

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,290
I've been with the company for five years.

54
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,210
We started about five years ago.

55
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,630
But in order to bring in data

56
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,040
and think about when your data gets,

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,873
you know, brought to you.

58
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,440
It's brought in usually
through a web browser,

59
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,180
some sort of an interface.

60
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,650
And this is where it gets decrypted.

61
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,510
And today it happens in a consumer browser

62
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,830
that you use, right?

63
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,270
So, Chrome and Edge and others,

64
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,097
and that's where that
thing called SSL kicks in

65
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,440
and it does the big
two prime numbers thing

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,630
and magically brings you your data.

67
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,160
And so, you know, five years ago,

68
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,390
or about four years ago, rather,

69
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,820
we launched the Enterprise Browser

70
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,800
and now we have controls over that.

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,990
So, this brought us data
protection controls.

72
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,030
It brought us delivery controls.

73
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,670
It brought us things we could
never do before, you know,

74
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,280
without trying to break open
SSL and inspect the wire

75
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,140
and see what the data
was doing inside there.

76
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,480
That's getting harder
to do as you guys know.

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,510
So, when we brought this
to market, you know,

78
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,220
we put all the controls that are needed

79
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,350
to also gain network access.

80
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,390
So, you think about this as
really not just a browser,

81
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,250
but really an enterprise workspace

82
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,950
that gets you access to the
data that you need to get to

83
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,810
and governs and controls the data

84
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,210
as it goes in and out of the organization.

85
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,270
So, that's kind of the
basis of what we've done.

86
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,090
And since we have brought
this to market, you know,

87
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,760
we have some of the world's
largest banks, you know.

88
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,280
I think we have most all
of them at this point,

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,930
at least in the top 10.

90
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,150
We have some of the largest
travel companies in the world,

91
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,510
a lot of adoption in
healthcare and BPOs, right?

92
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,310
Because that's where the data leaks out.

93
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,390
This is, unfortunately,

94
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,790
this is where data, the
operators can, you know,

95
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,040
potentially accidentally leak data

96
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,410
or intentionally, deliberately leak data.

97
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,770
And so we have, you know,
some fantastic customers

98
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,560
that have proven that this
technology, you know, is real.

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,550
They've invested with us

100
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,000
and obviously they're big
companies that we have

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
working with all around the world.

102
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,530
So, now, we have AI, and
this is kind of where we are.

103
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,880
You guys are probably gonna be flooded

104
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,180
with all kinds of stuff
around AI today and tomorrow

105
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,560
and for the rest of the week.

106
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,870
And it was cool. It's
super cool technology.

107
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,523
And we started with the
chat bots, you know,

108
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:51,180
then we got into, thanks
to ChatGPT and others,

109
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,190
and then Anthropic created the protocol.

110
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,250
So, we can do our modeling protocols.

111
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,820
We had connections we brought
in those AI agents, right?

112
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,280
We're starting to also see
consumer-based, you know,

113
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,230
AI browsers hit the market as well.

114
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,660
So, those are really
focused on the consumer.

115
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,880
So, the challenge though is what do we do

116
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,710
with trusting the data?

117
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,630
We need to make sure it's useful

118
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,170
so that builders and developers
can access backend data.

119
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,720
But they need to have
governed access to the apps.

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,210
They need to have governed
access to the data.

121
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,810
And it all needs to be audited
in a secure and safe way.

122
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,610
And what I mean, audited,
I mean, we need to see,

123
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,443
you know, what do they did?

124
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,860
What did they do? What did they click on?

125
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,560
What data did they go to?
Where did they move the data?

126
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,590
Did they move it from this
system to a different system?

127
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,620
And unfortunately, in
the world of AI agents,

128
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,030
when that access is granted,

129
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,850
it doesn't know much about
the role of the user.

130
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,120
And so, you know, you might
have somebody that has access

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,570
to, you know, the HR system
and they could query that.

132
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,040
They could say, "Hey, what's the CEO's

133
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,450
social security number?"

134
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,430
And of course it's got
access to that data.

135
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,840
It could deliver that data,

136
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,390
but the context of the
role was missing, right?

137
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,640
And so that's when it
starts to get complicated.

138
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,040
And the one thing between
you and those roles

139
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
is today an Enterprise Browser.

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,330
It's today something that
governs that activity

141
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,020
and governs your access
to what they can get to.

142
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,140
Passwords. A good example
of this are passwords.

143
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,940
So, yes, like I mentioned before,

144
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,590
I don't mind giving, you know,

145
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,570
somebody my OpenTable account.

146
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,150
That's a password. Maybe I
don't give them my bank account.

147
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,230
I certainly don't give them the keys

148
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,660
to the corporate accounts, right?

149
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,830
But that's where we are today.

150
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,730
We need those credentials in
order for AI agents to work.

151
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,470
So, how do we do this

152
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,620
without giving those credentials to AI?

153
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,440
And the answer is the Enterprise Browser.

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,310
That's the way to do it

155
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,260
because that's where it can be injected.

156
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,350
That's where data can make sure
it's never exposed visually.

157
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,530
It's never exposed on the wire.
It could be sent securely.

158
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,760
That's a big leg up for
everything we need this to do.

159
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,630
This is the future.

160
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,790
When we start talking
about these agentic AI

161
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,380
and you start seeing demonstrations

162
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,570
and, you know, future plans for this,

163
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,070
this is where the rubber meets the road.

164
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,960
It has to be done in the browser.

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,020
And we've already built this
to create that technology

166
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,870
and enable that in a way
that's safe and secure.

167
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,200
So of course, you know, we
need to have collaboration

168
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,800
and this is a lot different
than the consumer AI agents.

169
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,080
Again, as I mentioned
before, these are useful.

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,100
These are great.

171
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,612
These are great for the
individual, not for the role

172
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,320
within the corporation, right?

173
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,690
So when we think about the
enterprise grade requirements

174
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,880
that we have, this is where
we need to step it up.

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,980
We need to say, "What role
is that user responsible for?

176
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,720
What do they do within the company?"

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,910
You know, "Can they have
access to that data?"

178
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,970
So, that's where those
Enterprise AI agents

179
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,200
really come into play.

180
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,610
And so, today, you know,

181
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,000
we are talking about the Island AI agents

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,130
as something that we have introduced.

183
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,660
This lets teams create, share, run

184
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,110
secure, reliable agents in the browser.

185
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,480
And that's the place where
you need them, right?

186
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,640
So, this is where we can
control the data protection.

187
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,400
This is where we can automate
work across the businesses.

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,260
We can keep the data protected.

189
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,220
So, this is agentic AI
in an Enterprise Browser.

190
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,870
Today we're calling it AI agents.

191
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,840
And just to show you kind
of how we've built this.

192
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,580
You know, there is a trust layer

193
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,950
and some of these are
components within Island.

194
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,290
So, the Island components
of private access,

195
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,930
getting you to those network
resources already built in,

196
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,840
you know, the components
of data protection,

197
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,850
you know, those layers
are already built in.

198
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,440
So, when you create a model,

199
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,380
it's very easy to create that
model with a set of skills

200
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,820
that are repeatable.

201
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,620
And in order to do this, it's real easy.

202
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,440
You just do it, guess
what, inside of a browser.

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,580
You hit the record button.

204
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,200
You go through a series of steps.

205
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,990
And some of those steps
might be manual intervention.

206
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,490
You might have somebody
that needs to do something,

207
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,020
approve something, you know.

208
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,450
After all, they've got access to the keys,

209
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,070
to the kingdom, and everything else.

210
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,900
So we need to make sure
we have that audit trail.

211
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,340
We have that visibility.

212
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,100
And having those actions
in that human oversight,

213
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,040
it has to be done where humans work.

214
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,350
And again, that's inside of that browser.

215
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,860
And so we've built this
with control policy

216
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,530
into that hardened Enterprise Browser.

217
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,590
It can access storage, secure storage.

218
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,170
What's secure storage?
Could be your cloud storage.

219
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,790
Well, can I get there
with Chrome and Edge?

220
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,470
No, you used to,

221
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,790
but now you have the Enterprise Browser.

222
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,110
That's your only way to get there.

223
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,720
That's also the agents' only
way to get there, right?

224
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,150
So we've created that closed loop system

225
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,220
for that agentic AI to take over

226
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,870
and be able to do the functions

227
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,730
that are needed for the company,

228
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,230
and of course, that full audit trail.

229
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,330
This includes screenshots,
you know, mouse clicks.

230
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,950
Where did they type? What did they put in?

231
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,080
What came back out? What
did the screen look like?

232
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,750
You know, full audit,
full capability for that.

233
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,110
And so, when we have this
governance and control,

234
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,580
you have to think about,
well, who's gonna use it?

235
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,700
Well, we got the mode set up
so that a builder can build

236
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,680
what they need to build for an AI,

237
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,510
for an agentic AI within the browser.

238
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,760
Again, do the recorded replay.

239
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,650
You know, we have the
access to the applications.

240
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,720
Those are running in a
browser, whether they're PWAs

241
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,890
or, you know, just basic web
apps or maybe WebAssembly apps.

242
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,340
And then of course,
what they can do, right?

243
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,410
What they can do, which
button can they click on?

244
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,390
Which button can they never click on?

245
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,070
That's kind of an important thing.

246
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,540
If you don't want an agentic AI

247
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,390
to accidentally click the
big red button that deletes,

248
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,034
you know, 20 instances, you
know, of your EC2, right?

249
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:15,750
That's gonna be a challenge.
That happens in a browser.

250
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,750
That can be an agentic AI configuration.

251
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,360
So, that configuration
is important, you know,

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
can they just read the data
or can they delete it, right?

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,970
And so, now we have that
ability to give that oversight

254
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,010
and deploy with confidence.

255
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,290
And so, we can deploy
this in a number of ways.

256
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,030
Obviously, you know, the Island browser,

257
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,910
it can be run in a remote browser,

258
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,530
isolated browser environment.

259
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,360
This is a locally running browser as well.

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,400
So, most of the activity that you do

261
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,630
is gonna run on the endpoint.

262
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,410
It's gonna run, you know,
locally with your system

263
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,290
on your network, with your
data, with your credentials.

264
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,410
That's the productivity that
we really wanted to see.

265
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,780
And that's what, you
know, we can integrate

266
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,370
with Bedrock for that as well.

267
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,830
So, full integration with AWS Bedrock

268
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,120
so that you can keep your data.

269
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,180
It could be, you know, stored
within the Bedrock system

270
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,130
and it obviously built
for scale for there.

271
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,260
So, what did amazon.com do?

272
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,400
So, again, I mentioned

273
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,290
that we have kind of a
customer testimonial,

274
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,320
and I was hoping Adam could
be here to talk about it,

275
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,360
but what they were able to do is

276
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
they found a way to use our
agentic AI or Island's AI agents

277
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,240
to build some real productivity

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,280
within some of their key systems.

279
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,170
And they did this in a few ways,

280
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,140
but the whole point of
this was that it was easy

281
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,400
and they put the hands in the folks

282
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,020
that actually knew what they were doing.

283
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,420
Folks that know that it's
a repetitive task, right?

284
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,070
If they're doing the same
thing over and over again,

285
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,570
they know that they could save time.

286
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,460
So let's put the power of that automation

287
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,740
into the hands of the
folks that could use it

288
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,880
and let's make sure it's governed

289
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,500
and let's make sure it's safe.

290
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,860
And so, you know, this
is kind of how it's done.

291
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,100
Pretty simple as you can
think about a recorded replay.

292
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,560
If anybody, you know, has
been in IT as long as I have,

293
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,900
you probably heard of Mercury Interactive.

294
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,390
We used to record and replay
scripts like Selenium scripts,

295
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,310
and COM, and CORBA, and DCOM,

296
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,960
and all these different protocols.

297
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,910
It's kinda like that, but super easy

298
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,620
'cause it's built into the browser.

299
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,720
So, all we do is you prompt the user

300
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,820
with what workflow to build

301
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,190
and include a set of skills along the way.

302
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,790
And those skills could be
click on this, search for this,

303
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,310
do this button, take this PO number

304
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,440
and copy it and paste it over here.

305
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,460
And that's productivity

306
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,610
that you can quickly
do across applications.

307
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,630
And again, this all happens

308
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,120
within that governance of the browser.

309
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,820
You validate it. You edit
the flows if you need to.

310
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,880
You add human interaction
steps for those needed.

311
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,530
And then of course you share
that with your department

312
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,973
and increase productivity.

313
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,130
These are the three use cases.

314
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,250
And I do wanna have questions
here in just a minute,

315
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,480
but these are the three use cases

316
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,190
that they actually put to work.

317
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,510
So, amazon.com and their
marketing teams and a few others,

318
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,300
they're doing some really
cool automations already

319
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,950
as Island customers.

320
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,020
And so what that means
is their purchase orders.

321
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,060
They're automating the updating of the,

322
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,500
a lot of these manual
tasks that are happening

323
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,750
as well as the social media
team and the marketing team

324
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,520
doing things across different platforms

325
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,150
and moving data, adding
tags to certain areas

326
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,030
so that they can be quickly
monitored a little bit better

327
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,260
with those tags.

328
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,370
But again, all things

329
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,620
that they would just be
naturally doing in the browser,

330
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,610
we can automate that

331
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,760
and make sure that they're
now governed and safe.

332
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,250
And again, that's that tag
creation there at the bottom.

333
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,180
So, in particular, I like this solution

334
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,000
that he really wanted to
showcase this himself,

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,160
but the challenge here on
this purchase order one

336
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,920
that top use case was
that they were spending,

337
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,870
and I think it was 30 minutes
per day for 1,000 users.

338
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,210
So 30 minutes per day for 1,000 users

339
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,630
today at Amazon right now are being saved

340
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,690
because they've implemented
this agentic AI solution

341
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,010
with the Island browser.

342
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,350
And basically what it is,
it's updating permissions.

343
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,480
It's copying and pasting PO numbers.

344
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,070
And before it actually gets executed,

345
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,770
before they actually pay that
bill, they get a little prompt

346
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,660
that says, "Okay, we did all this work.

347
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,710
Is this the bill you want to pay?"

348
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,870
And they hit yes in the browser

349
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,430
and then it executes that transaction

350
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,960
and actually pays the bill.

351
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,400
So anyway, 80, I think it's
80 cumulative hours per week,

352
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,100
which is an amazing
impact over 1,000 users.

353
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,740
That's a big deal. So, that's
what I wanted to show today.

354
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,630
Obviously you can see the power

355
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,160
when you think about agentic AI.

356
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,210
If you're not thinking about

357
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,880
what it can do within a browser context,

358
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,580
you're not considering
it, you know, thoroughly

359
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,170
because this is where the data is.

360
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,300
This is where you have access to the data.

361
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,430
And now with the Enterprise
Browser of Island,

362
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,160
you've got the governance,
the control, the audit,

363
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,280
and you have that capability
just naturally built in

364
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,080
to a single, you know, ecosystem

365
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,210
for that app delivery mechanism.

366
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,940
And we'd love for you
guys to come see a demo.

367
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,710
This is something that
I could talk about for,

368
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,180
you know, for three days.

369
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,260
You still wouldn't get it.

370
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,170
If you come see it, I guarantee
you it's not just a browser.

371
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,270
It's a true enterprise delivery workspace.

372
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,580
We'd love to give you a demo
and walk you through it.

373
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,500
We've got just a few minutes for questions

374
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,700
if anybody has any.

375
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,650
We've got a roaming mic coming through.
