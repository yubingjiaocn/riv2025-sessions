  "abstract": "As use of serverless technology grows, the resilience testing (also known as chaos engineering) for serverless becomes even more crucial for ensuring reliable and available applications. Join us as we demo new capabilities for testing the resilience of AWS Lambda-based workloads, and unpack how these faults were built and run under the hood. You'll also leave with valuable lessons gleaned from our customers' experiences with modern serverless applications.",
