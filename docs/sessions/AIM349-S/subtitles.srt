1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,110
- All right, good morning.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,610
I think it's still morning.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,750
Appreciate everyone joining.

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,480
Welcome to AWS re:Invent.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,890
My name is Anita Mikus,

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,350
and I run the Government
and Education market

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,150
for Kyndryl in the US.

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,170
Wanna welcome you here.

9
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,970
Thank you for joining our session.

10
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,030
We will be talking about
AI-native enterprise today.

11
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,420
We've got a pretty cool
lineup in terms of format.

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,280
First, I'll be talking about

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,440
how AI and Kyndryl are partnering

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,480
to help the public sector experience.

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,000
And then we'll weave into a fireside chat

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,520
with a couple of special
guests to talk more about

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,433
how AI is helping the student experience.

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,670
So I wanted to start with a quick poll.

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,590
Hopefully you guys can hear me.

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,710
First question, how many
people are articulate

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,300
and fully understand the difference

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,763
between generative AI and agentic AI?

23
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:51,120
(audience chattering)

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,953
Okay, good.

25
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:56,160
All right, and how many
people are using AI today

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,060
to solve their business problems

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,925
or maybe personal problems?

28
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:02,220
(audience chattering)

29
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,120
All right, good.

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,030
So my hope is that by
the end of this session,

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,760
you've learned a little bit more about AI,

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,950
and specifically, how we can leverage

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,330
and how you can leverage AI

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,733
to solve some of your business challenges.

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,680
So as we look at the public sector today,

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,830
and especially in the state
and local government space,

37
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,450
there is a huge disparity

38
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,550
between what the public expects

39
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,940
and the services that are
offered by public agencies.

40
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,930
Over 50%, actually, 53% of citizens say

41
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,350
that they are frustrated with
accessing public systems.

42
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,690
And I think about my own experiences.

43
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,750
I can, on Sunday night, order
my groceries on my laptop

44
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,830
with a click of a button.

45
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,480
I can get a ride to here

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,910
with an Uber or a Lyft
app within a minute.

47
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,350
But I think about, "Oh my gosh,

48
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,660
I gotta figure out the
status of my state taxes.

49
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,807
I don't know where to start."

50
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:57,807
"I gotta go get my transcripts
from 1992 when I graduated.

51
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,330
That's gonna take a
whole day for me to do."

52
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,480
So it's really just a
huge disparity between

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,030
what people are used to
receiving in the private sector

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,080
versus the public sector.

55
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,773
And that's really something
that we all need to work on.

56
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,080
In parallel, there is a 80% use of funds

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
by the state and local government entities

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,610
on maintenance and operations.

59
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,710
That means old systems.

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,030
That means we're not talking

61
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,350
about moving the needle forward,

62
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,760
we're not talking about modernization,

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,170
we're not talking about transformation.

64
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,680
We are literally spending a
majority of our taxpayer dollars

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,450
to maintain legacy systems.

66
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,650
And what this means over
time is increased cost.

67
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,690
It means that you have less resources

68
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,060
that are able to staff the functions

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,860
to maintain your legacy systems,

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,340
and eventually you may end
up having security issues

71
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,453
and exposures.

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
So this is where we intersect
between the challenge

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,180
and the opportunity.

74
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,480
How do we leverage AI
in our core operations

75
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,940
to help us to reduce support costs,

76
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,470
to increase stability,

77
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,430
to help security,

78
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,920
and ultimately deliver a better experience

79
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,013
for citizens and for
students in universities?

80
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,310
I wanted to share a couple
of examples of areas

81
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,480
that Kyndryl has worked to leverage AI

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,420
and to create some pretty nice outcomes.

83
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,750
First one is in Stockton, California.

84
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,330
Kyndryl helped deliver the
city's first public-facing

85
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,460
AI-predictive dashboards,

86
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,050
which provides 320,000
residents real-time insights

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,680
into road safety and
estimated repair times.

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,900
In a large Midwest city in the US,

89
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,040
we've modernized the parking
and citation management systems

90
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,930
with an AWS AI-powered
omni-channel contact center,

91
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,310
try to say that a few times,

92
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,620
reducing wait times for up to 20%.

93
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,470
So this means how much time
people stay on the phone

94
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,960
or wait for information
or updates to understand

95
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,270
how they can continue with their day

96
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,290
in citation management.

97
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,810
And at UCLA, which we'll dig into deeper

98
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,460
during our fireside chat,

99
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,440
we have worked on digitizing
over 2 million paper records

100
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,193
and laying the foundation for
AI-driven student services.

101
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,270
So at the core of all of these examples,

102
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,560
where we have leveraged AI

103
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,420
to improve the experience
is Kyndryl's AI Framework.

104
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,740
When we talk about AI,

105
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,450
and native AI specifically,

106
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,690
we're talking about baking AI
into the core of operations,

107
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,490
not as a project, not as a pilot,

108
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,310
but embedded in every
single thing that we do.

109
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,713
The Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework,

110
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,770
sorry, the Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework

111
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,750
includes three main components.

112
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,630
The first one is ingestion of data.

113
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,700
It enables the capture of structured

114
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,790
and unstructured data
from diverse sources.

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,240
So think about source code
to help us with understanding

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,290
what are the dependencies,

117
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,090
what are the relationship
with your source code?

118
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,070
Think about security and IT policies.

119
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,300
When we create agents,

120
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,220
making sure that they're within the realm

121
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,830
of what we consider to
be the safe standards.

122
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
Think about policy and procedure guides.

123
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,980
How do your operations run?

124
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,570
What do we do? What are the opportunities?

125
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,610
What are the bottlenecks?

126
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,260
The second is the agent builder.

127
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,420
And this deploys intelligent agents

128
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,850
for specific business functions.

129
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,120
The agents can automate
tasks, make decisions,

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,303
and ultimately, adapt based on context.

131
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,750
The third component is the agent catalog.

132
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,580
And this is where the magic happens.

133
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,330
It's a centralized repository
of reusable AI agents

134
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,700
that enable us to scale

135
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,320
by deploying repeatable models

136
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,630
across the organizations.

137
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,480
Together, these elements help us to go to

138
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,403
and evolve into a proactive
AI-native operating model.

139
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,050
So I wanna share with you a short video,

140
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,810
which I guess I'm gonna be doing too,

141
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,290
around how Kyndryl has helped with AI

142
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,833
in a client setting.

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,800
All right.

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,870
It's not working.
- Yes, it was.

145
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,890
- Oh, it was?
- Yeah.

146
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,230
- Okay, hold on.

147
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,329
(audience chattering)

148
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,503
- Press the link.
- Play.

149
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,110
- (indistinct)
- Enter.

150
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,943
Now it's-
- Good.

151
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,643
- Yep.
- Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,280
- Just press it-
- One time.

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,070
(bright music)
- You got it.

154
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,903
- [Anita] I'm in tech.

155
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:27,789
I'm an IT expert. (laughs)
- The car rental industry

156
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,820
has been completely disrupted

157
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,080
by the likes of Uber and Lyft

158
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,243
and faces existential crisis.

159
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,440
The crux of the issue
with these legacy rentals

160
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,300
are their rigid pricing engines,

161
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,683
which are hard to change.

162
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,330
This has resulted in declining
revenue year over year,

163
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,063
and major operational
efficiency challenges.

164
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,930
We are partnering with
a major rental customer

165
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,720
to fundamentally reimagine
their pricing engine

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,373
using agentic AI.

167
00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:01,890
The Kyndryl Agentic Ingestion
Tool analyzes dependencies,

168
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,080
extracts embedded business rules,

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,273
and creates a modernization roadmap.

170
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,050
This step transforms static legacy logic

171
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,140
into structured human-readable format.

172
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,270
We use the outputs from ingestion

173
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,970
to automatically generate
comprehensive tests

174
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,860
and modern code.

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,030
The outcome is a flexible
microservices-based architecture

176
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,670
that supports modular
components like fleet,

177
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,150
customer, pricing, and ERP integrations,

178
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,080
all designed to work independently
but seamlessly together.

179
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,280
The result is a cloud-native
API-first environment

180
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,170
that accelerates innovation,

181
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,060
simplifies integration,

182
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,900
and gives us the agility to
evolve with business needs.

183
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,780
Finally, we are evolving
the pricing functionality

184
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,940
to a dynamic system.

185
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,430
This involves three distinct agents.

186
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,030
The first agent ingests
multiple external sources,

187
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,310
such as weather insights
and flight patterns,

188
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,920
to come up with probabilistic pricing.

189
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,130
The second agent runs
Monte Carlo simulations

190
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,560
to understand the implications

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,640
of various pricing scenarios

192
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,310
on revenue and fleet utilization.

193
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,010
And the third agent
performs compliance checks

194
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,860
based on state and federal guidelines.

195
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,420
This modernization program

196
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,170
is set to deliver a
state-of-the-art dynamic pricing,

197
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,540
just like ride sharing platforms

198
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,260
where prices adjust in
real-time based on demand,

199
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,921
availability, and external factors.

200
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,504
(bright music)

201
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,760
(audience chattering)

202
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,580
- Okay, hopefully that
helped to drive home

203
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,040
the Kyndryl Agentic AI
Framework a little bit more

204
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,140
in terms of how it works in action.

205
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,210
So I'd like to shift
gears a little bit now

206
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,940
and invite two incredible
leaders to the stage

207
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,770
for a fireside chat.

208
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,830
As mentioned earlier,
Kyndryl has partnered

209
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,140
with UCLA Anderson School of Management

210
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,900
to reimagine the student experience.

211
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,790
I'm excited to invite Howard Miller,

212
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,090
the CIO for UCLA Anderson
School of Management

213
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,740
to share more about this transformation

214
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,020
and how it's helping students at UCLA.

215
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,590
And I would also like to
invite Kyndryl's Chinh Vo,

216
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,920
Vice President of Innovation
at Scale for the US.

217
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,050
Alright, well welcome, folks.

218
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,697
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:22,740
(audience clapping)

220
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,720
- Okay, so Howard, I'm
gonna start with you.

221
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,140
- Cool.
- As a pioneer of AI,

222
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,690
both as a person and as a CIO

223
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,673
and also UCLA being a pioneer of AI,

224
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,110
what are the things that inspired you

225
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,520
or compelled you to start you
on your native AI journey?

226
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,020
- Wow, I mean, this is a long story

227
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,580
and we only have a certain amount of time,

228
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,460
so I'll try and keep it relatively brief.

229
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,310
I think it starts with a
conversation with my dean

230
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,480
almost three years ago.

231
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,950
We're at that three year mark

232
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,070
when ChatGPT first became
something that we all knew

233
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,690
and heard about.

234
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,010
And he said to me, "Howard,"

235
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,130
he said, "I put my final into
ChatGPT and it got a B plus.

236
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,020
You know, what's our value premise here

237
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,220
in higher education?"

238
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,370
And you know, it's not
as draconian as it seemed

239
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,203
at that time.

240
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:12,120
And over that course
of the next 12 months,

241
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,260
what we did at UCLA Anderson is

242
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,460
we decided that we wanted
to be an AI thought leader

243
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,660
as a school.

244
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,700
We formed an AI task force,

245
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,930
which was cross-functional

246
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,270
between faculty, staff, and students.

247
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,910
This was September of 2023.

248
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,440
We started to ideate on things

249
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,130
that we thought might make
sense for us as a business.

250
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,320
We got to the end of December 2023,

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,570
we found a platform that we liked.

252
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,360
We found a cost that made sense for us.

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,500
We pitched it to the dean,

254
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,480
and I said, "Is this something
that the school wants

255
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,250
to go forward with?"

256
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,083
He said, "Yes."

257
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,760
So two months later, we were
working with some consultants.

258
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,190
We had a platform, and
then two months later,

259
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,620
ultimately, we had our first
two production use cases.

260
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,140
So it's kind of a labor of love.

261
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,900
It's not something that
you get to overnight.

262
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,910
I think I'd highlight the importance

263
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,600
of having a cross-functional
group of people to get together

264
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,850
and help you set that direction.

265
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,040
I would encourage you, if
you haven't started already,

266
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,440
and I saw by the show
of hands that many have,

267
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
but for those who haven't,
it's not too late.

268
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,870
I think it's okay to fail fast.

269
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,550
I think you want to find things

270
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,990
that are quick time to value,

271
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,150
so don't try to boil the ocean.

272
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,220
And try and find things
that really have meaning

273
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,060
for your business.

274
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,520
So AI is a great technology.

275
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,220
It's the most transformative
technology I've seen

276
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,920
in 35 plus years working in IT.

277
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,820
But at the end of the day,

278
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,030
you still have to marry
back to business outcomes.

279
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,010
- Yeah, so I think this
is a great example of

280
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,850
how AI can help educational institutions.

281
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,280
And as we start to see some
funding cuts potentially,

282
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,380
this is a great method.

283
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,710
So next question, Howard, is challenges.

284
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,690
What sort of challenges did you face

285
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,600
and then specifically how
did you overcome them?

286
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,000
- Sure, so, you know, truth be told,

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,940
there are always gonna be
challenges along the way.

288
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,920
Specifically with the work that we did

289
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,400
with Kyndryl in the app that we built,

290
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,500
one of the biggest
challenges is this is one

291
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,110
where we decided to attack student data.

292
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,730
And so I already told you about the things

293
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,810
that are quick time to value,

294
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,040
and if you wanna go to sensitive

295
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,040
and confidential data, don't start there.

296
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,930
But with the work that
we did with Kyndryl,

297
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,360
we decided that we wanted
to attack student data.

298
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,450
I'll get more into the app
that we built in a little bit.

299
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,720
But to do so, there were a ton of hurdles.

300
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,270
In addition to just institutional

301
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,770
organizational change management,

302
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,600
so in other words, convincing somebody

303
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,740
at the center of campus

304
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,030
that we could go ahead and do this

305
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,790
and follow third-party risk management,

306
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,010
we wanted to ensure the
security and privacy

307
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,570
of that student data.

308
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,020
So we took extra care to
architect that environment

309
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,860
such that it mirrored the
Information Security Policy

310
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,650
of the UC system almost line for line

311
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,543
so if it was ever gonna get audited

312
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,490
that it would pass that test.

313
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,930
So there were definitely challenges

314
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,200
around the data security,
the data privacy.

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,790
Culling together all of the data

316
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,830
that we put into this application,.

317
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,590
we took from a lot of
different disparate systems.

318
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,930
We took from the
student's record database,

319
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,820
we took from our career placement,

320
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,560
we took from our clubs,

321
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,120
we took from our course catalog.

322
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,370
So culling all of that together

323
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,290
to put that into one application

324
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,600
in one environment in one engine,

325
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
definitely there was some labor of love

326
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,560
that was associated with that.

327
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,450
And then just lastly,

328
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,400
at the end, having a user interface

329
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,260
and being able to approach it

330
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,840
with something that a student
might ultimately want to use.

331
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,840
And that was the compelling
part of this application

332
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,580
to begin with, right?

333
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,100
At a two-year graduate
school of management,

334
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,540
our students come in very quickly.

335
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,140
They're not there for very long.

336
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,800
We inundate them from the beginning.

337
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,060
They start in the summer

338
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,310
before classes even start in the fall.

339
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,930
We send them a ton of email.

340
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,000
They're starting to
interview for internships.

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
They're doing their coursework.

342
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,090
Some of them still don't really know

343
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,010
what they want to be when they grow up.

344
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,870
And so on top of all of this,

345
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,460
we just say, "Good luck," right?

346
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,960
And there are career advisors,

347
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,570
there are things to
help them along the way,

348
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,700
but the application we
built was really meant

349
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,750
to be a roadmap.

350
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,740
So if you came in

351
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,590
and you said you wanted to be
a product manager at LinkedIn,

352
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,330
or you wanted to work here,

353
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,267
we could give you some kind
of prescriptive path to say,

354
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,390
"If this is what you want to do,

355
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,920
you should take these courses.

356
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,350
You should look at these
companies for internships.

357
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,270
You should join these clubs."

358
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,940
And ultimately, these companies
are the like companies

359
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,890
that follow that roadmap to

360
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,410
where you ultimately
wanna go to be successful.

361
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,780
So all of that was part and
parcel of the challenges

362
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,040
along the way.

363
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,950
- So one thing we've
talked about is the rate

364
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,500
and pace of technology
and how fast it's moving.

365
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,043
We started this project with you,

366
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:46,740
I think it was December of 2023.

367
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,960
We finished around August of 2024.

368
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
So one of the things that
I think about a lot is

369
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,580
what would you do differently

370
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,940
or how would you approach
this project differently now

371
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,170
versus when we started

372
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,810
and embarked upon it
a couple of years ago?

373
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,700
- Sure, I think I would
have, as I said earlier,

374
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,400
I think I would have failed
faster to begin with.

375
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,320
I think we spent so much time trying

376
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
to get the architecture right

377
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,470
that by the time we launched,

378
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,350
the technology had changed so much

379
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,540
that not putting
something out there sooner

380
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,610
and getting it into people's hands

381
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,470
and going back and reiterating on that

382
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,510
was probably the biggest mistake we made.

383
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,980
- Yep, got it. Okay.

384
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,870
Chinh, over to you.

385
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,060
So from your vantage
point leading agentic AI

386
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,990
for Kyndryl US,

387
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,170
how do you see organizations
approaching AI,

388
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,660
are customers ready to become AI native,

389
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,860
or what trends are you seeing?

390
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,050
And I know you're just three
or four months into Kyndryl,

391
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,190
so welcome.
- Yeah, yeah.

392
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,390
- Appreciate you.
- Three or four months

393
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,450
into Kyndryl, but I've been in
this for quite a while there.

394
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,640
So actually a lot of the
trends that I'm seeing is,

395
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,040
it's sort of reflected
in Howard's story there.

396
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,370
So especially in in
education, institutions,

397
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,050
and government agencies there,

398
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,140
you know, the promise of
sort of the value coming out

399
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,730
from the generative AI

400
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,560
when ChatGTP came out,

401
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,170
you know, that's sort
of just the reactive way

402
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,460
of actually engaging with it

403
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,250
to the progressions to
agents acting independently

404
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,453
to multi-agent systems

405
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,580
through the agentic
workflows we have today.

406
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,410
You know, in each step
there, the value is there.

407
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,750
And I think that the excitement

408
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,960
in each of these, you
know, sectors is there

409
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,793
and it's palpable.

410
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:20,130
And to Howard's point,
actually my oldest daughter,

411
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,930
she's a junior this year.

412
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,260
But last year, even as a undergrad degree,

413
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,970
she used it in a field
where it was emerging.

414
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,570
It was an arts program
combined with data science,

415
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,860
machine learning, and computer science,

416
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,000
because they're trying to really do

417
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,160
that creative aspect to things.

418
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,330
But with that, the university

419
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,220
was just building this program on the fly.

420
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,440
Now, imagine having
someone going through that,

421
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,940
planning a course load
and things like that

422
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,280
as the things are
changing at the same time.

423
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,480
I can tell in personal experience,

424
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,460
it was hard and a lot of work there.

425
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,503
Now, if we actually had a
system that Howard describing

426
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,540
just for that purpose there,

427
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,070
it would have saved both her experience

428
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,360
and even the faculty's experience

429
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
actually doing this there, right?

430
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,730
So the value is there.

431
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,960
So what's stopping all of this here?

432
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,460
And I think the two main points,

433
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,870
it was really highlighted.

434
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,030
One is data, the other one is trust

435
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,650
on that side of things there.

436
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,763
So on the data side, where
Howard started his journey,

437
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:10,170
I think from a technology
perspective there,

438
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,400
there's a lot of solutions out there on

439
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,310
how we can actually speed
up that process both from,

440
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,160
you know, cleansing the data
to accessing the data in place

441
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,170
as opposed to moving
into one location there.

442
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,680
That can really hit your timeline there.

443
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,410
The second aspect of it is trust itself.

444
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,770
First of all, all the
policies, audit trails,

445
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,480
and you know, the things
that Howard described,

446
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,280
it's not just an education.

447
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,750
It's the same thing in government agencies

448
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,580
and things that we have to do there.

449
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,610
Then having the idea of an
autonomous agent just interact

450
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,490
with this data, it scares
a lot of corporations

451
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,960
and our customers there.

452
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,557
And so I think the trend
that we're seeing now

453
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:48,720
as we're moving through
that is actually services

454
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,760
that's gonna actually
address those issues.

455
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,857
If you just noticed the
recent announcement from AWS

456
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:55,350
for all the AgentCore services there,

457
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,060
from making sure that the agents

458
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,190
are accessing the right tools,

459
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,450
on policy engines there

460
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,560
and making sure the agents are doing

461
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,910
what they're supposed to be doing,

462
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,220
and then observability
aspect to it, right?

463
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,810
In terms of making sure that,

464
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,890
Howard was saying,

465
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,930
do we actually know what an
agent's doing at all times?

466
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,320
Can we actually see that
audit trail around that?

467
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,380
So I think the change is
the foundation to that,

468
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,322
it's supporting that, it's allowing us

469
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:21,030
to get to that trust aspect of things.

470
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,400
And then lastly, just
wrapping all around there,

471
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,110
it's all the soft stuff around it.

472
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,760
Any transformation we see,

473
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,010
you have people side of things.

474
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,940
How do we actually work
for the consumers of this

475
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,230
and also the providers of this.

476
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,580
Their process isn't gonna change,

477
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,750
and we got to figure out how that works.

478
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,350
And then also

479
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,550
the business process
optimization piece of it there.

480
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,640
So there's a lot of things
that comes into play there.

481
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,680
- Yeah, so I think my next question

482
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,300
is probably applicable to both of you,

483
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,770
so please feel free to weigh in,

484
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,640
but when we do any sort of
large transformation project,

485
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,620
bringing our people
with us is so important.

486
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,600
You talked about trust.

487
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,310
I think Chinh from your perspective,

488
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,490
I'd like to hear what do
you think is so important

489
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,980
about OCM, Organizational
Change Management,

490
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,710
when you're doing a
significant AI transformation

491
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,090
in your organization?

492
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,480
- Yeah, I think if I break
down actually my job role,

493
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,510
you can see that my role
is Innovation At Scale,

494
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,650
which is a little ambiguous
there what it actually is.

495
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,760
It actually encompass major functions

496
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,280
to help our customers adopt AI.

497
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,140
And it's actually the data AI practice,

498
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,420
which is that says for itself is required.

499
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,560
Our enterprise strategy, technology,

500
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,330
architecture side of things,

501
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,170
people and performance,

502
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,080
that's the OCM performance
side of things there.

503
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,913
And then the vital,

504
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,270
which is the user
experience side of things.

505
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,740
If you think about what
I've just described there,

506
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,980
we need all of it to actually
do this successfully.

507
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,860
And that OCM or change
management piece is still central

508
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,820
and core to it.

509
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,620
So all that is actually under my umbrella

510
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,510
because we have to work together actually

511
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,030
to make sure that adoption's successful.

512
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,740
- Thank you. Okay,
question for both of you.

513
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,450
So Howard, oh, whoa, we'll start with you.

514
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,060
How do you see the
landscape of AI changing

515
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,470
as we move forward?

516
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,790
What are the things that you'll do?

517
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,860
How can you manage-
- I'll go back

518
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,916
to the landscape in a second.

519
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:08,820
- Yeah, okay.
- Chinh said something

520
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,340
that made me reflect on the answer

521
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,110
to the question that you asked.

522
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,550
And when we started this project,

523
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,850
the ability to get at data was somewhat

524
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,683
of an issue, right?
- Yeah.

525
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,540
- So you said we had to take
all of that data that we had

526
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,640
and we put it in one place.

527
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,800
And to the question of where AI is going,

528
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,630
now, we wouldn't have to do that.

529
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,463
- Yep.
- Right?

530
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:29,296
The ability to integrate

531
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,080
into so many different things with AI

532
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,900
is one of the bigger changes
maybe in the last six

533
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,743
to nine months
- Absolutely.

534
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:36,960
- that would have certainly made my,

535
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,510
you know, journey with this
application a little different.

536
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,950
So I wanted to highlight that

537
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,870
because I think it does speak to

538
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,220
how quickly things are changing

539
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,940
and how it's difficult for us
in the seats in which we're in

540
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,310
to sort of predict what's next, right?

541
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,460
And so you've talked about
your agentic AI framework,

542
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,070
I'm looking at tools that do low-code AI

543
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,300
with agent builders,

544
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,150
no-code AI, which is just drag and drop.

545
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,470
I think we're all trying to figure out

546
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,740
what agentic AI can mean
for us organizationally.

547
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,690
Again, for UCLA Anderson, it's sort

548
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,580
of this fail-fast approach.

549
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,620
I have a couple of
things that are agentic,

550
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm not gonna say they're the sexy,

551
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,960
what everybody thinks agentic
AI should be at this point.

552
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,360
I have an agent that
can call another agent

553
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,980
and it can successfully do that,

554
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,710
handoff such that the person
who's going from agent one

555
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,390
to agent two can then go into agent two

556
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,190
and do specifically what they want,

557
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,160
so it all doesn't have to
be done under one hood.

558
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,810
And the reason for that approach again

559
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,060
is building blocks, foundational.

560
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,710
Again, if you try to architect something

561
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,570
so large at the beginning,

562
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,430
you stand that chance to fail.

563
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,430
By putting those building blocks together

564
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,920
in a very measured way
as part of that journey

565
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,420
is sort of how we're approaching it

566
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,250
and how we're gonna get there next.

567
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,160
I think we're gonna be in
this agentic AI phase myself

568
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,020
for at least the next nine to 12 months.

569
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,140
I know 2025 was supposed to
be the year of agentic AI.

570
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,710
2026 will probably still
be a year of agentic AI.

571
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,140
But I think the ability to have agents

572
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,370
that call other agents

573
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,280
that actually can deliver
on business outcomes

574
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,780
without scaring away the humans

575
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,790
who think their jobs are gonna be replaced

576
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,100
is ultimately sort of
where we wanna head next.

577
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,230
- Okay, thank you. And
then Chinh, same for you.

578
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,060
Where do you see the future of AI

579
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,910
for enterprises going in
the next 12 to 18 months?

580
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,220
- Yeah, I think it's gonna build on.

581
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,630
I think we're got to get to a point

582
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,900
where the discussion of agents
as part of an enterprise

583
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,970
is not gonna be a question anymore.

584
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,110
It's gonna be a reality

585
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,900
that we're gonna have to
account for and plan for there.

586
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,080
And I think the patterns and trends

587
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,673
and architectural approach
is gonna help support that.

588
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:37,050
It's gonna be driving that.

589
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,590
I actually look back at how
we'd look at compute services.

590
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,330
If you remember, we went
from virtualizations

591
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,730
to containerizations to serverless.

592
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,690
At this point in time there,

593
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,160
I think no one is questioning the fact

594
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,890
that we can run enterprise
critical systems on AWS

595
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,720
and any of those with
the compute services,

596
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,910
which was not the case when
we were first starting.

597
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,163
And I'm seeing the same trend
in the AI side of things

598
00:22:56,163 --> 00:23:00,150
with the architecture
support of that piece there.

599
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,160
And I think the framework that we have,

600
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,960
like our Kyndryl Agentic Framework,

601
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,520
it's a very lightweight framework,

602
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,730
and to address Howard's point,
we're not heavily investing

603
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,680
any particular tech stack side of things.

604
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,530
We know three months from now,
six months from, 12 months,

605
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,363
it's gonna change.

606
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,240
Something's gonna come up.

607
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,250
We gonna have to make sure
that it can adapt properly

608
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,190
and pick that up really
in an efficient manner.

609
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,450
And I think that's where we're gonna go.

610
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,370
It's these sort of lightweight frameworks

611
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,450
where we can adapt change

612
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,010
and actually just pick
up the latest trends

613
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,600
as it comes along.

614
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,610
- Great, well, I wanna thank you both

615
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,657
for sharing your comments
- You're welcome.

616
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:31,830
- and your perspectives.

617
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,620
I think a few things that
are really important is,

618
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,050
you know, the criticality of the data.

619
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,660
Making sure that we have clean data

620
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,140
and then it's used in the
way that is intended to.

621
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,670
Understanding outcomes.

622
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,320
AWS always talks about working backwards.

623
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,080
I think we're all here trying
to solve business problems,

624
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,950
and we have to look at

625
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,750
what is the business problem
we're trying to solve,

626
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,670
and then work backwards.

627
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,840
I think involving people,

628
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,660
both of you mentioned having
to bring your people with you

629
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,270
to make sure that when you go
through this transformation,

630
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,680
they understand the what, the why,

631
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,810
and the what role they play.

632
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,450
Howard, you mentioned
iterating, right? Fail fast.

633
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,640
How do you make sure that
whatever you're building

634
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,340
at the end of it isn't
not what you expected?

635
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,080
So really just making
sure that we iterate.

636
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,360
And then I think both of
you talked about trust.

637
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,860
Really making sure that there's trust

638
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,140
as you build these new systems.

639
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,060
So as we wrap up our session,

640
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,830
I can't change the screen, sorry.

641
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,180
Let me go do that.

642
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,225
- Not from there anyway,

643
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:26,058
right?
- I wanna thank you all

644
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:26,973
for joining.

645
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,900
And I wanna make sure, and I hope,

646
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,580
that each of you from this session learned

647
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,260
a little bit more about AI,

648
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,780
and more importantly,
how you can leverage AI,

649
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,910
whether it's agentic or generative

650
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,280
in helping to solve
your business problems.

651
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,800
If you're interested
in learning more about

652
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,450
how Kyndryl can help you,

653
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,810
you can visit booth 1475

654
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,330
or you can register for
an agentic AI workshop

655
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,740
using the QR code.

656
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,560
So I wish everyone a
wonderful rest of your day

657
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,000
and enjoy AWS re:Invent,

658
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,006
and thank you for taking
time with us today.

659
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:02,006
