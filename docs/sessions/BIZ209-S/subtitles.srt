1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:02,070
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,590
Can you hear me pretty well in the back?

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,540
Since it's so quiet over here,

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm sure it's so easy to hear.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,350
Anyways, my name is Rafa Flores.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,030
Rafael Flores, Chief Product
Officer at Treasure Data.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,570
Gonna be more excited to
spend my afternoon with y'all.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,890
It's gonna be a quick 20 minutes,

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,530
but we're gonna have a
little bit of fun, okay?

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,020
So with that, today,

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,500
we're gonna talk a little bit
about data chaos to AI magic.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,620
And everyone here has
been talking about AI,

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,300
but they're missing a critical piece,

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
which is, nobody's been
talking about data, right?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,380
And so, I am gonna do that,

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,820
and I'm gonna try to bring it all together

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,590
because at the end of the day,

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,750
AI is only as good as what you feed it.

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,520
That is what we say at our organization,

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,990
and that is what I believe in,

21
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,720
also, as a technologist, right?

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,920
You need to ensure that
you upgrade the human brain

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,420
along with agentic by design products.

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,390
And that's exactly what
we're gonna talk about, okay?

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,060
Today, there's a lot of tools out there.

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,590
They're just interfaces.

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,660
You go and you chat, you put a prompt.

28
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,010
That's just an interface.

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,830
To many folks who may
not know AI very well

30
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,320
or are just trying to learn,

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,620
that seems like a very agentic
product, right? But it's not.

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,290
It's just a chat prompt,
calling on a model.

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,140
It's not as powerful, right?

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,910
What I wanna talk about
and what I wanna focus on

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,780
is actually the agentic brain
that's underneath that, right?

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,633
And if you really think
about where AI is headed,

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,080
a lot of people talk about
is it just hype, is it not?

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,840
Are there credible use
cases? Are there not?

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,970
Well, some are, some don't. Right?

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,880
And hopefully, over the
next 18 and a half minutes,

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,650
I can help you understand
what's gonna work

42
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,483
and what's not gonna work.

43
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:43,110
So, you try to avoid some of the things

44
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,000
that we have learned as an organization

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,600
in supporting our customers
who have embraced AI, right?

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
And I wanted to start with the metric,

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,990
which is actually pretty cool.

48
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,887
It says, "Gartner published
a report saying that,

49
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:58,887
'By 2027, 40% of AI first
projects will fail,'" right?

50
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,890
There's a thousand
reasons why they may fail,

51
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,870
but it's just a reality.

52
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,460
And when you're thinking about investing

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,030
into an AI native
product, you wanna ensure

54
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,430
that you're making the
investment worth the while.

55
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,997
You don't wanna be part of the statistic,

56
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:17,790
"In 2027 that says that
'40% failed,'" right?

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,360
So, how do we make sure
that you don't fail?

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,290
It's all about identifying
some of the gaps, right?

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,360
And there's two critical gaps
that I do wanna emphasize.

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,150
Number one, there's a readiness gap.

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,260
And there's a readiness gap

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,300
not so much just in terms of products,

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,060
but also in terms of your organizations.

64
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,280
You need to ensure that you're structured

65
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,540
in the proper way in-house to
even bring AI-native products

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,900
or AI-first initiatives into those teams.

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,140
You need to ensure that you
have the right use cases, right?

68
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,790
Use cases are still the same thing.

69
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,080
A use case is a use case. It's
there for a reason, right?

70
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,670
You have to ensure

71
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,973
that you know why you are
bringing in those initiatives.

72
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,770
Second problem, unifying disparate data.

73
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,810
That's not going away, right?

74
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,140
You can use AI to solve some of that,

75
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,030
but if you have messy data,

76
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,130
your AI is still not gonna be that strong.

77
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,610
And I'll walk you through
an actual example, right?

78
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,070
But you also have to think
about the current markets.

79
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,970
And this is a reality

80
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,530
that we all deal with across the board.

81
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,000
It's something we deal at Treasure Data,

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,100
something I'm sure all of you deal with.

83
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,190
And the reality is that the
budgets are not changing.

84
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,570
Budgets are a little bit constrained,

85
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,920
whether you're IT or marketing.

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,050
It's just a matter of fact, right?

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,160
And the price to compete is
actually gone up to be able

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,830
to get brand exposure, to
be able to land customers.

89
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,660
whether you're a B2B, B2C.

90
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,060
It's just tighter of a race.

91
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,560
Everyone's trying to win this race,

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,880
and it's just getting tighter

93
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,250
because, again, the budgets
haven't changed very much,

94
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,740
and the price of compete
has gone up, right?

95
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,660
And so, it's a little bit chaotic.

96
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,430
And then if you think
about macroeconomics,

97
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,320
everything going on in the world,

98
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,820
it gets even messier, right?

99
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,530
Every day you wake up,
you gotta think about AI.

100
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,770
You gotta think about,
okay, what is going on next?

101
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,980
So, how can I help you
leave that world, right?

102
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,350
And get to a better place
where you can actually go

103
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,050
and find solutions to some of the problems

104
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,790
that I have just talked about.

105
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,250
And that's where customer
data platforms come in, right?

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,420
Treasure Data, historically,

107
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,220
we have been a customer data platform.

108
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,860
We have become a AI-native marketing cloud

109
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,620
with the marketing super
agent at the top, right?

110
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,750
And again, the reason why
we have gone that route,

111
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,000
and the reason why I
believe in that mission is

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,520
because your AI is as good
as the data you feed it.

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,720
And there's a very much value
in your first-party data.

114
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,103
CDPs allow you to do that.

115
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,940
If you utilize quality data,
you can implement agents

116
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,370
that actually allow
you to be a superhuman.

117
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,140
Now, I don't believe that AI

118
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,020
and agents are here to take your job away.

119
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,310
And I kind of chuckle at that

120
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,770
'cause I'm sure some people say that,

121
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,490
or some of you may believe it.

122
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,540
This is my own opinion,

123
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,270
but as an organization,
we also believe in that

124
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,310
because we believe that
making you a superhuman

125
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,660
is giving you the right tooling

126
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,690
or the right AI products
to make you successful,

127
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,290
regardless of what functional
department you sit in.

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,650
Because ultimately, what we
wanna do is we wanna help IT

129
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,200
and marketers become super humans

130
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,300
and drive customer experience, right?

131
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,360
That is the job that many of you do.

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,340
And it's not just about
what marketing wants

133
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,660
or what IT wants,

134
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,510
it's ultimately what drives
your business forward, right?

135
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,760
And this friction, or this
dilemma has been around

136
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,530
for a long, long time.

137
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,651
Marketing wants this, IT complains,

138
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,510
IT doesn't wanna re-pipeline,
marketing complains.

139
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,270
Well, how can we ensure
that both teams get

140
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,360
the right tooling to ensure
that they can succeed?

141
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,220
Because ultimately,
their success is joint.

142
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,690
It's not disparate as much

143
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,183
as their data can also not be disparate.

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,080
Some of the common pitfalls
that we see, right?

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,370
As we work with a lot of global
2000 brands, there's four.

146
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,990
Scale, right?

147
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,320
If you have limited memory,
limited context in your AI,

148
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,790
it's hard to scale it.

149
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,010
And it's not just scale
and sense of performance,

150
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,530
it's scale in the sense
also of your use cases.

151
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,183
What are you trying to serve?

152
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,630
Number two, there's a common dilemma.

153
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,450
Do we build, do we buy, right?

154
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,660
It depends how you structure in-house.

155
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,490
If you have highly technical teams,

156
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,500
and you're ahead on the AI ball game,

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,510
then you should probably
continue down that path

158
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,410
and find ways to accelerate
or augment that with vendors.

159
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,450
If you don't have those teams,

160
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,610
then you should probably
be buy first, right?

161
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,080
'Cause it's gonna be a heavy investment

162
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,513
and a big uplift to try to do it yourself.

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,780
Data quality. We talked about this.

164
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,320
I cannot emphasize that enough,
right? Data quality matters.

165
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,640
AI is not just going

166
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,530
to solve every single
one of your problems.

167
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,180
If you go into ChatGPT today,

168
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,820
and you give it a bad prompt,
that is bad data quality,

169
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,800
that is also gonna be a bad response.

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,390
And that is not a bad model.

171
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,910
It's just your prompt was bad, right?

172
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,200
And so, if you're also giving that

173
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,210
to your autonomous
engines in the background,

174
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,370
bad data, bad output.

175
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,340
And then AI adoption. It's
a real challenge, right?

176
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,400
Every company that I meet
with, every CMO that I talk to,

177
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,930
it's not just about embracing AI,

178
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,520
it's also, okay, how do
we make the best of it?

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,890
How do we ensure that we
consume those credits?

180
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,930
How do we make sure
that we actually engage

181
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,270
and our teams are gonna
go and chat, right?

182
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,540
With those interfaces?
That's a real pitfall.

183
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,460
And that, again, ties to
the fact that you need

184
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,980
to ensure that you have
use cases at the top.

185
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,750
You can't talk about
adoption if you don't talk

186
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,960
about the use case for
the business, right?

187
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,480
And so, there's five
tips that I'll give you

188
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,380
to ensure that your AI
actually succeeds and works.

189
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,700
Now, you can see them all here.

190
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,020
I see some of you taking photos.

191
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,850
I'll wait a quick second,

192
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,400
but I'll go through them
one at a time, okay?

193
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,980
And we'll dive into the weeds of it.

194
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,080
Number one, you have to ensure

195
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,600
that when you look at an AI vendor

196
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,780
and you have at the top
of your mind the concept

197
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,780
of AI and data equals the
proper personalized experiences.

198
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,900
You gotta ensure that they can
do identity-resolved memory.

199
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,550
What does that mean?

200
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,580
That means giving you a source
of truth profile, right?

201
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,310
The golden record era is, to me, that.

202
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,830
Today, you're more entering
an era of the diamond record.

203
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,960
Something that you're more in control of.

204
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,820
Something that's not just deterministic

205
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,710
or probabilistic in nature,

206
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,320
but it's agentic in nature, right?

207
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,930
That you have full control,
that you can fully trust,

208
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,790
so that when you target that person,

209
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,760
it's actually the person
you need to target.

210
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,943
And it's not just wasting
precious marketing and IT dollars.

211
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,800
Number two, context at inference,

212
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,120
every interaction matters
most, more than ever, right?

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,410
The concept of real-time
matters now more than ever. Why?

214
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,170
If you have the latest behaviors,
forget about attributes,

215
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,760
forget about just the profile.

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,500
If you have the latest behaviors
to the milliseconds, right?

217
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,250
You actually ensure that
anything you put on autopilot

218
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,500
is being delivered at the right time

219
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,350
to the right person
across the right channel.

220
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,230
If you don't have that, you
could be missing a moment.

221
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,940
And many of you have seen that, right?

222
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,700
How many of you here in the
audience have made a purchase

223
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,470
and then you get an email the next day

224
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,060
or the same day saying, hey, you should go

225
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,190
and purchase X, but you just bought it.

226
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,930
You already bought it.

227
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,120
And you're not the only
one that got that email.

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,850
Imagine how many of those emails went out.

229
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,070
That also means you spent some bucks

230
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,410
sending those emails out,
or somebody did, right?

231
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,430
It cost the company something.

232
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,970
It wasn't free, because it's
not context at inference.

233
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,320
It's not in real-time.

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,630
You need to ensure your AI vendors work

235
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,953
and operate in real-time.

236
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,123
Number three, governance and trust.

237
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,000
Extremely important.

238
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,980
You don't wanna be that automotive company

239
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,510
that put a chat bot on their website

240
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,300
and suddenly, somebody was
able to go and get a free car.

241
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,260
You'll make the news,
free brand dollars, right?

242
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,150
But not for good reason.

243
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,410
And so, you have to ensure

244
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,230
that you're built on the concept of trust.

245
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,670
It's not so much just the
data, right? It's also the AI.

246
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,260
If you can trust the data,

247
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,040
and you can trust the AI, you
can actually use that vendor.

248
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,510
I always tell our customers, right?

249
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,477
They always come to us and say,

250
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:16,740
"Hey, why should we use your
AI product versus X versus Y?

251
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,450
Why should we trust it?"

252
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,700
And my answer to them is the
same answer I'll give y'all,

253
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,320
which is, you already trust us

254
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,850
with your most critical resource.

255
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,270
And that is all the IP
of PI information we have

256
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,920
of your consumers or your shoppers,

257
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,010
or who you're trying to target, right?

258
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,020
If something was to happen to that data,

259
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,210
they will actually have major lawsuits,

260
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,660
but they trust us because we
have a proven record with it.

261
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,820
So, if you trust us with your data,

262
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,960
you can trust us with
our AI as well, right?

263
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,540
And, but you have to have
this at the forefront.

264
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,370
And one of the reasons we're here at AWS

265
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,440
is we work very closely with them, right?

266
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,750
We use bedrock within our architecture

267
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,880
because of all the bells
and whistles it comes with

268
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,700
from a trust and governance
standpoint to ensure

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,340
that our brands that we
serve can actually operate.

270
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,740
And they're not worried that
they're gonna get a lawsuit

271
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,813
because their AI or their data broke.

272
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,443
Number four, feedback loops.

273
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,190
It's not just getting data in real-time,

274
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,250
it's also iterating on that data, right?

275
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,410
If you go and build a journey,

276
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,560
how many of you here are
familiar with journeys?

277
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,360
There's a few. Okay.

278
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,560
If you go and you build a journey,

279
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,940
a journey is a path of, hey,

280
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,210
this profile here off of floors
of Treasure Data who likes

281
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,570
to buy X car, goes down a
journey of how do we get him

282
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,460
to actually purchase the next vehicle

283
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,400
across different channels
based on different signals.

284
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,690
Well, any pivot in me as a potential buyer

285
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,820
should be accounted for in that journey,

286
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,670
which means you need to
account for feedback loops.

287
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,040
'Cause any change that I do in my actions

288
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,620
or interactions needs to be accounted for

289
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,210
in those feedback loops.

290
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,640
And it has to, again, be in real-time.

291
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,080
If you miss the moment,
you miss the moment,

292
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,400
you won't get it back, okay?

293
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,810
So you gotta capture the signals.

294
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,510
You gotta make sure you iterate on it.

295
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,513
Number five, it has to be
an extensible ecosystem.

296
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,120
What do I mean by that, right?

297
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,380
It sounds like two big words

298
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,503
and something that I
just pull out of a hat.

299
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,110
In the world of data platforms,

300
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,260
there's a concept of where
should the data reside?

301
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,720
Should it sit in my data warehouse?

302
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,060
Should it sit in my activation channel?

303
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,060
Should it sit in my CDP?
What do I do with it?

304
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,740
It doesn't matter, right?

305
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,230
Wherever your data sits,
you need to have a vendor

306
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,430
that can pull that data without
charging you extra for it,

307
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,680
so you could use it, right?

308
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,690
And the concept of compostability

309
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,200
has really risen in the past few months

310
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,470
because companies are trying
to adopt and embrace AI.

311
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,230
And so, when they're trying
to get an agent out the door,

312
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,937
they wanna feed it all the data they have.

313
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,400
And that data could be in
a lot of systems, right?

314
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,300
The MarTech stack or Adtech
stack, it's pretty broad.

315
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,040
And so, you should be
able to pull that, right?

316
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,570
And so, that means that
you gotta make sure

317
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,130
that you have an open ecosystem.

318
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,120
And here's a great example.

319
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,600
I love this visual because when
we talk about compostability

320
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,060
and where should the
data reside for your AI,

321
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,880
everyone talks about zero copy, right?

322
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,050
We need to have zero copy.

323
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,610
We need to ensure that we can just move

324
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,320
the data free flow and et cetera.

325
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
The concept of zero copy,

326
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,280
and I can tell you this from
a very technical background

327
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,530
of mine, doesn't really exist.

328
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,530
If any vendor tells you
that they are zero copy,

329
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,640
that's actually not true.

330
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,620
There's always a some sort of copy

331
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,510
for a specific set of use cases.

332
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,370
If you want to do things in real-time,

333
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,810
you have to have a copy of that data

334
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,970
in your activation
channel because you have

335
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,440
to have a trigger that actually goes

336
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,350
and engages that person
or engages that brand.

337
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,570
That's a copy. It's not zero copy.

338
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,190
That's a copy, right?

339
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,410
And so, when you really
think about it, historically,

340
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,990
if you go back many years
ago, you have four copies.

341
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,410
Your systems. I wish
I had a pointer, okay?

342
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,403
Your systems, data warehouse,
CDP, email service provider.

343
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,860
And then we moved away from that, right?

344
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,140
And we said, well, compostable CDPs.

345
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,960
Now, you have the channel
where the data's coming from

346
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,380
to your data warehouse,
to your activation layer.

347
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,170
Well, in this new world,
if you really wanna be

348
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,930
in a zero-copy-type of environment,

349
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,160
your data's always gonna come in

350
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,770
from a specific touchpoint
into your data warehouse.

351
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,930
And it should be able
to flow anywhere, right?

352
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,100
It shouldn't have to sit in your CDP.

353
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,560
It shouldn't have to sit in
your email service provider.

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,990
You should be able to really
pull it from anywhere you want.

355
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,330
But again, it's, there's two copies.

356
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,770
So, if there's anything
you take away from this,

357
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,150
other than the fact that
we're cool and bad ass

358
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,340
at Treasure Data, take
it that there's no such

359
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,040
a thing as zero copy in the world.

360
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,830
Where does that bring us, right?

361
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,180
I want you to actually meet something

362
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,520
that's really cool in
this new era of agent

363
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,050
and intelligence, right?

364
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,173
And we talked about earlier,
the interface versus the brain.

365
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,670
Every prompt, every chat
you go on, again, interface.

366
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,710
But you need more than that.

367
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,720
And if you bring in the right data,

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,180
you make it agentic by design.

369
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,560
Now, this is our latest product.

370
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,570
It's called a marketing super agent.

371
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,130
Now, what it does is it's connected

372
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,840
to your first-party data.

373
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,240
So, it's not just going
and calling on models

374
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,850
and pulling in deep research information

375
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,070
or doing deep analysis
from anywhere in the web,

376
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,260
which is powerful, don't get me wrong.

377
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,240
But you have valuable resources.

378
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,090
You have first-party data in-house today.

379
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,760
This allows you to pull from
that plus everything else.

380
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,930
So, if you want to go on here

381
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,490
and just create a nurture
journey campaign, you can, right?

382
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,360
And it's doing everything.

383
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,580
Campaign programs is looking at content.

384
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,320
It's creating digital assets.

385
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,420
It's looking at competitive landscape,

386
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,140
and it's doing the data
analysis within your CDP

387
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,610
or within your data warehouse,
wherever your data resides.

388
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,900
Now, this is a 32nd clip of it.

389
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,370
If you wanna learn more,
you can go to Booth 235.

390
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,500
We'll show you a full demo of it.

391
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,050
But that is what we talked
about when we state,

392
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,810
hey, we need to ensure
that you use agentic

393
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,250
by design products, right?

394
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,980
The agentic brain because the brain is

395
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,720
as good as you train it.

396
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,700
Your model is as good as you train it

397
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,340
with the right data set.

398
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,483
It's very simple.

399
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,480
Every company is gonna
have agents. We have 'em.

400
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
Many vendors here have
them. It's nothing new.

401
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,700
The ones that are gonna win are those

402
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,010
that actually have brains that are powered

403
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,870
by data that's contextual.

404
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,430
It goes back to, again,

405
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,160
being able to give context on inference.

406
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,690
It's gonna be governed.

407
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,840
It goes back to trust and governance,

408
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,670
and it's gonna be in real-time

409
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,910
because you need to account
for every single interaction

410
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,073
to make it meaningful and be impactful.

411
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,120
Now, I'd earlier that AI is not

412
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,220
gonna replace your team or you, right?

413
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,320
And I do believe that.

414
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,610
I've heard the whole era of
BDRs are gonna go and disappear.

415
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,010
This has been a dilemma
for the last 20 years.

416
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,960
And poor BDRs are still around,

417
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,940
and they serve a good purpose, right?

418
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,800
And right now, there's
a lot of that going on

419
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,960
and there's a lot of
fear that AI is racing.

420
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,090
Don't be scared of AI. My
biggest advice is to use,

421
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,923
embrace it.

422
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,030
Embrace it to your advantage.
Make the best of it.

423
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,080
Use it as a tool. I use
it, as CPO of this company.

424
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
I love this quote.

425
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,440
And the reason why I love this quote is

426
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,690
from a head of product over at Google,

427
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,147
he set the 80-20 rule,
which I agree with, right?

428
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,570
"If you can put 80% of
things on autopilot,

429
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,820
the mundane things, the things
that you don't wanna do,

430
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,890
the things that you go
and clock into your job

431
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,120
and you just say, 'Oh, man, I gotta do

432
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,430
that report again,'" right?

433
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,630
But then there's that 20%

434
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,880
that's always gonna
require the human element.

435
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Focus a hundred percent
of your time on that 20%.

436
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,820
And that'll make it so much more impactful

437
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,350
because in the current era of AI,

438
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,030
you need to be able to focus.

439
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,500
You can't put everything on autopilot.

440
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,640
Some things are gonna be copilot.

441
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,560
Some things you're
always gonna have to do,

442
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,093
brand guidance reviews,

443
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,230
the feelings you want to
evoke as a brand or company,

444
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,930
they come from you to a human, right?

445
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,760
So there's humans in the loop,

446
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,390
and I want you to take that
away from this session as well.

447
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,540
So with that, I got two minutes
left. Thank you so much.

448
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,060
I can take a question or
two before they boot me off,

449
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,023
but any questions?
