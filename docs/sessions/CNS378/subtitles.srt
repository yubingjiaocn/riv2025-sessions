1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,560
- Hey everyone, thanks for joining us.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,750
This is an amazing conference.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,490
There's so many people around.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,800
Thank you for taking the time
out of your busy schedule

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,943
to join us here.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,550
How's everybody's conference so far?

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,190
It's good?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,843
- Amazing response. Okay, great.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,100
So my name's Jesse Butler, I
am a Principal Product Manager

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,530
in the Amazon EKS Service Team.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,660
I'm joined by my colleague Sriram.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,310
- Hey everyone, I'm Sriram Ranganathan.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,460
I'm a Product Manager with
the Amazon EKS Service Team.

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,050
- So we're really excited to talk with you

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,750
about something we've been
working on for several months

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,510
called Amazon EKS capabilities.

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,820
So I'm gonna start with some context,

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,010
go through sort of some of the theory

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,980
of why we built this set of features

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,140
and how we hope they will benefit you.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,850
And then Sriram will come back up

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,550
and dive into some of the details.

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,460
So just starting with
kind of setting context,

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,440
if anybody's seen any of
the launch announcements,

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,530
you know that this is
related to platform services

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,890
and growing sort of
your cluster experience

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,000
through these foundational
services for GitOps,

28
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,860
I like this quote from Alan Kay,

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,020
who's the father of the
SmallTalk programming language,

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,167
object oriented programming.

31
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,020
"Simple things should be simple,

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,300
complex things should be possible."

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,940
This is a great analog to abstractions.

34
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,580
Like why do we abstract things in systems?

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,040
A little bit more on
point to our discussion

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,177
is one from Dijkstra,

37
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,480
"The purpose of abstraction
is not to be vague,

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,030
but to be creating a new semantic level

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,850
in which one can be absolutely precise."

40
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,400
This is a better sort of
software engineering concept

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,660
around abstractions.

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,820
We don't wanna hide the abstractions

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,280
because of the complexity
under abstractions,

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,350
because often there's
power in them, right?

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,390
If you look at AWS or look at Kubernetes,

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,610
there's so much you can
do with that cluster.

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,410
The last thing we want to do

48
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,510
is put a sort of layer on top of it

49
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,153
that obfuscates, we want
to actually elevate.

50
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,180
So Kubernetes itself is an abstraction

51
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,650
or a set of abstractions

52
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,950
Kubernetes makes complex things possible.

53
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,180
We like to look at Kubernetes
as sort of the platform layer

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,960
for many customers, it's
the front door to AWS.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,750
It's often said that
Kubernetes is complex itself.

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,200
I personally have worked on
fairly large software projects

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,900
scheduling thousands or hundreds
of thousands of processes

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,540
across hundreds or thousands of computers.

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,550
That is possible, but it is hard.

60
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,700
It takes a lot of concerted,
deep technical effort

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,350
and a lot of resources.

62
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,673
Kubernetes democratizes
scaled distributed computing,

63
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,020
and this isn't my opinion, right?

64
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,090
The world kind of agrees.

65
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,030
So 80% of enterprises are
using Kubernetes in production

66
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,340
with another 13% report piloting

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,880
or kind of investigating
for future adoption.

68
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
So this has become a defacto
standard in cloud computing

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,200
because it is a good abstraction

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
because it is a powerful way

71
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,483
to layer functionality into your systems.

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,600
So simplicity is one of the
things that we're looking for,

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
and we'll talk a little bit about how EKS

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,645
is one of our sort of tenets

75
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:21,990
of making simpler experiences
for our customers.

76
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,290
We also need to think
about consistency at scale.

77
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,990
This is where we have things
like declarative configuration

78
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,060
and how these kind of
cloud native practices

79
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,050
have come to be.

80
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,450
System consistency is incredibly important

81
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,820
at the scale that many of you operate at.

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,460
And if you're just getting
started in your scaling journey,

83
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,890
the scaling level that you aspire to,

84
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,230
consistency is paramount.

85
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,440
We also have extensibility
as a core requirement

86
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,690
for building platforms
in the modern world,

87
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,240
and Kubernetes is incredibly extensible.

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,250
These abstractions are good and powerful,

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,600
but you can also extend them

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,360
and build out any of your
own custom needs, right?

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,443
Into the cluster.

92
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,270
So one of those things
around extensibility

93
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,960
is kind of the result is
this huge vast ecosystem

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,420
of tools and projects that are available

95
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,070
for you to use, right?

96
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,830
Kubernetes itself is incredibly resilient

97
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,390
and very, very powerful,

98
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,850
but it is not itself an end-to-end

99
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,740
production ready application platform.

100
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,310
As many of you probably already
know, you need to do things,

101
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,190
you need to install things
in the cluster to make it be

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,820
what you need it to be to ship
and run software at scale.

103
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,770
So the CNCF has over 200
projects at this point,

104
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,830
hundreds of compatible tools,
this ecosystem is vast.

105
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,510
There's really unlimited customization.

106
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,060
Beyond that, you can
build your own controllers

107
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,010
and have your own custom
resources in the cluster

108
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,080
to do just about anything you want

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,540
from managing AWS cloud resources

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,193
to ordering Domino's pizzas.

111
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,180
When we look at simplicity

112
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,020
and all of that amazing
abstraction and extensibility,

113
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,720
we're really talking
about relative simplicity.

114
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Kubernetes itself isn't a simple thing,

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,070
but it is relatively simple

116
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,140
when you compare it to other things.

117
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,920
For example, the Core system
has about 1,500 methods,

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,370
and AWS SDK has about 10,000.

119
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,990
Now these are vastly different things

120
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,952
with different purposes.

121
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:20,670
AWS is a bunch of features
and products and other things

122
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,990
that do a lot of things,

123
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,590
but there is relative simplicity
if you compare the two.

124
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,690
And what's nice with EKS

125
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,900
and using Kubernetes as
the front door to AWS,

126
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,140
is that you're able to capture
some of that complexity

127
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,420
and powerful primitives
that you can abstract

128
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,370
for your end users, or for yourself

129
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,020
as you're scaling your workloads.

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,320
So seven years ago when
we started Amazon EKS,

131
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,260
we launched it actually right
here at re:invent in 2017,

132
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,580
our main motivation was to
make Kubernetes more accessible

133
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,260
to AWS customers.

134
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,050
We knew that this
abstraction, this primitive

135
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,450
kind of, the set of primitives

136
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,000
and these kind of standards would evolve

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,090
and we were right, we're
very happy to have been right

138
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,840
because the growth of
EKS has been enormous.

139
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,630
EKS started as a managed
control plane, right?

140
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,820
So we knew that doing
Kubernetes the hard way

141
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,250
while educational was actually hard.

142
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,550
So the managed control
plane was where we started

143
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,250
and we've evolved ever
since with this mission

144
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,340
to help you build reliable and stable

145
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,253
and secure applications
with Kubernetes clusters.

146
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,470
And it's very important to note

147
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,920
that it's Kubernetes, it is
upstream compliant Kubernetes.

148
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,170
So we get to benefit from
all the extensibility

149
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,193
as well as you do.

150
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,020
So if we look at one of
the feature layers for EKS

151
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,440
around the data plane and node management.

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,690
So when we started with
that managed control plane,

153
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,630
we had self-managed nodes,
this was fine, right?

154
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,090
The real complex part
was in the control plane

155
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,010
and actually customers
wanted self-managed nodes,

156
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,690
they wanted that autonomy.

157
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,150
And over time, that became burdensome

158
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,430
to manage all of those nodes directly.

159
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,590
And so we put a lifecycle, API on it

160
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,960
with managed node groups allowing you

161
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,600
to create groups of nodes
that you could manage

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,973
with API calls and manage that lifecycle.

163
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,890
Moving to last year at re:invent,
we announced auto mode,

164
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,430
which is a fully end-to-end
fully managed data plane.

165
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,130
So that gives you an
end-to-end push button cluster

166
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,950
where you just, you don't have
to worry about nodes at all.

167
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,680
We fully manage everything
as well as the storage

168
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,450
and networking integrations, right?

169
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,850
So this is an example
of the evolution of EKS,

170
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,000
starting with what we know
customers need at the moment

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,610
and evolving over time
based on your feedback

172
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,140
and also based on, you know,

173
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,030
where the direction of Kubernetes is going

174
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,953
as well as the direction of AWS.

175
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,170
So when customers start with
EKS, we're talking about

176
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,620
building and managing clusters, primarily.

177
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,900
And EKS makes it really
easy to do that, right?

178
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,190
At this point, with auto mode,

179
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,380
you go into the console,
you click a button,

180
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,270
rather than going and growing coffee beans

181
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,190
and roasting them and
making pots of coffee,

182
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,590
you can simply get a cup
of coffee from the kitchen

183
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,410
and come back and pretty
much have a cluster up

184
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,330
and ready to go.

185
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,650
So our mission since launch

186
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,420
is to then continuously improve

187
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,890
this cluster lifecycle management for you

188
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,980
to make that a better
experience over time.

189
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,190
Adding new feature layers
like auto mode, hybrid nodes,

190
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,840
these are all sort of
commitments toward that vision.

191
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,540
But when you look at
scaling your workloads

192
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,240
and using more clusters and
expanding your workloads

193
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,300
across multiple accounts
and multiple regions,

194
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,580
you're really scaling with Kubernetes.

195
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,900
EKS helps you build and manage
production-ready clusters.

196
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,500
It's up to you to manage
and scale your Kubernetes.

197
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,440
So workloads, networking
components, storage resource,

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,210
all the integrations that you have

199
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,880
plus any custom solutions that you need.

200
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,710
All of those things come into the cluster

201
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,230
and become things that you
manage maybe with Helm charts

202
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,690
or maybe with other methods.

203
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,690
This can work really well to get started

204
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,510
and even at scale, can work really well.

205
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,400
There's a lot of people that
are very good at automation,

206
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,520
are very good at governance,
but as scale continues,

207
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,770
you have more regions, more accounts,

208
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,620
depending on how autonomous
your teams need to be.

209
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,260
Compliance gets hard, auditing gets hard,

210
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,873
and scale just brings
more operational burden.

211
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,450
So if we look at how most customers

212
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,860
are dealing with cluster
management beyond the API,

213
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,950
there's a lot of Terraform
use, some CloudFormation

214
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,920
and we're seeing some Kubernetes IaC.

215
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,220
So what we have here is
sort of the imperative

216
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,610
external to the cluster
IaC, mostly Terraform

217
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,590
and this works really well.

218
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,650
We have version controlled
declarative configuration

219
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,053
that's reconciled against
a source of truth.

220
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,980
Terraform does its thing
and you get a cluster,

221
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,740
and this can work as you
scale as well, right?

222
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,340
Having two or three teams going
across a couple of regions.

223
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,090
As you start to scale, this
can work incredibly well,

224
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,720
but at some point we do
hit a point of friction.

225
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,370
We experience this problem
where there's just too many.

226
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,170
either too many cooks in the kitchen

227
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,650
or there's too many pipelines
for one small team to manage.

228
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,200
And if something goes wrong,
we end up in this position

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,280
of trying to find where it
went wrong, how to remedy it,

230
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,840
who even owns it, right?

231
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,853
This can be a problem with scale.

232
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,030
So we start with single clusters

233
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,610
and you want to get to this
all seeing all dancing,

234
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,280
cross region, cross
account, scalable thing.

235
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,280
How do customers who have
been most successful with EKS

236
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
get there?

237
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,550
What we see is that there's
this inflection point

238
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,170
around the point where multiple
clusters come into the mix

239
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,570
and you want to get to that next level

240
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,670
of abstraction and automation.

241
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,980
This is the point where
we see a lot of customers

242
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,660
start investing pretty heavily

243
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,510
in dedicated platform
engineering resources.

244
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,920
We move away from sort
of decentralized teams

245
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,040
and more toward a structured
platform engineering path

246
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,903
to get you to the next level.

247
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,860
This is something that we see commonly

248
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,410
with all of our most scaled customers,

249
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,750
but all of them do it
a little differently.

250
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,490
This is bespoke investment, right?

251
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,920
There is engineering work to be done here

252
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,290
that is not necessarily the business logic

253
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,480
that you wanna ship to customers.

254
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,620
At our largest customers,

255
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,330
there's dedicated platform teams

256
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,690
whose customers are the internal
development teams, right?

257
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,630
So this is a place where
we see a lot of investment

258
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,630
and a lot of commonality, but
things are slightly different.

259
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,930
One thing that is true

260
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,790
is that these platform engineering efforts

261
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,300
follow these sort of core
cloud native characteristics

262
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,767
that we see in Kubernetes

263
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:53,460
and also repeated
throughout the ecosystem.

264
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,280
Declarative configuration
and continuous reconciliation

265
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,280
are things that are just the
kind of bread and butter,

266
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,440
primitive of these systems.

267
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,020
Programmatic discoverability
and observability.

268
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,090
These are really important at scale.

269
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,890
You know, if you wanna run 400 clusters

270
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,290
with a team of five
people, you need to be able

271
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,240
to automate and you need to be
able to watch where you are.

272
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,510
Active drift detection itself,

273
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,610
automated self-healing is really

274
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,770
a sort of Holy Grail, right?

275
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,780
Wouldn't it be great if the system

276
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,880
using its underlying primitives

277
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,770
could keep itself whole, right?

278
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,360
What if an imperative change comes in?

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
What if something fails?

280
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,790
Can something automatically
fix that at 2:00 AM for me

281
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,460
and slack me so I can see
it with my morning coffee

282
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,250
rather than getting paged
at 2:00 AM in the morning?

283
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,330
And on top of all of this,

284
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,640
we want these things
to be standards based.

285
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,720
You know, Linux took off

286
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,810
because it wasn't the best
operating system on the planet,

287
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,920
it was an open standard

288
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,470
that we could all contribute
to and make better.

289
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,240
That's what we see with Kubernetes.

290
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,153
It's an open standard, it's
portable and it's governed.

291
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,290
So when we look at these characteristics

292
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,490
and we think about Kubernetes,

293
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,530
we check all of the boxes, right?

294
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,210
This is how the system was built.

295
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,620
And I think it's important to note

296
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,530
that as we start looking at
something like EKS capabilities

297
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,700
and wondering, do we need this?

298
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,950
Do I need this in my world?

299
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,370
We often find that people
who are new to Kubernetes

300
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,940
and new to DevOps are learning
DevOps through Kubernetes.

301
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
They start using Kubernetes
and they find that these things

302
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,680
are the aspects of the system,

303
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,730
where in fact these are kind
of just DevOps best practices

304
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,400
that through trial of fire and ice

305
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,570
have become the principles and
the standards that we know.

306
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,930
Kubernetes was designed with
these principles in mind.

307
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,880
So we see that Kubernetes is in fact

308
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,140
a reference implementation

309
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,700
of these underlying characteristics

310
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,263
that are ideal for systems.

311
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,540
The reality is that there is
no ideal system for everyone.

312
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,310
Every customer has different needs

313
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,200
and different requirements.

314
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,610
You may have different
governance and compliance

315
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,500
for restricted regulated workloads

316
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,420
and restricted environments

317
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,340
and just generally culture, right?

318
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,290
It's different across every customer.

319
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,060
Everybody has different needs.

320
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,000
So we can't say, oh, take
the GitOps off of the shelf

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,910
and I'll buy that product
and I'll just use it.

322
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,320
That's not how that works, right?

323
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,780
We have to think about
all of the different ways

324
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,540
that we have to keep the standards open

325
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,060
and keep the primitives
light so that you can build

326
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,893
what you need to in order to scale.

327
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,450
One thing that we see across

328
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,070
all of our most successful
scaled customers in EKS

329
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,570
are these common platform
foundational components.

330
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,067
Really looking at workloads

331
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,950
and infrastructure for cloud resources

332
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,455
and infrastructure for
the underlying clusters

333
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,690
and related, you know,
to production databases,

334
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,920
that kind of stuff.

335
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,590
These are the foundational components

336
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,050
that every team has to solve for,

337
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,640
you know, depending on
the line of business

338
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,960
or the culture or even the
the point of scale, right?

339
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,030
All the other things may be different,

340
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,230
but these are three things

341
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,530
that everyone has to
account for at some point

342
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,393
as we begin this scaling journey.

343
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,200
So we look to GitOps and I think

344
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,813
this was a very trendy and
buzzy word for a while.

345
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,790
We've been really
consistently guiding customers

346
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,790
toward GitOps since 2019 or 2020.

347
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,470
So since before it was a buzzword

348
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,000
and through it being a buzzword

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,700
and now it's no longer a buzzword.

350
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,460
I think of GitOps as a
reference implementation.

351
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,350
You know, it takes these best practices,

352
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,690
these cloud native system fundamentals

353
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,690
and sort of how we think of a system

354
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,550
running well in the cloud today

355
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,940
and it turns it into a
reference implementation.

356
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,480
These four characteristics are
what makes a GitOps system.

357
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
You can build it with Korn Shell scripts

358
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,870
on a Raspberry Pi if you want to

359
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,900
it doesn't have to be Kubernetes,
but it does have to have

360
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,750
its desired state expressed declaratively.

361
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,390
Declarative configuration is a requirement

362
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,160
for practicing GitOps.

363
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,500
That desired state is
immutable and versioned,

364
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,720
which just means if it's a YAML file,

365
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,693
it goes into Git, it's
versioned, then it's immutable.

366
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,280
The desired state is
automatically applied from source.

367
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,740
So when you push something to Git

368
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,390
it automatically ends up
in your running system.

369
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,010
Now these three first things

370
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,120
are anybody using Git and
doing Ops, that's GitOps.

371
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,950
The last one is most paramount.

372
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,520
And the thing that makes such
a good fit for Kubernetes

373
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,090
is the desired state is
continuously reconciled.

374
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,710
So that means imperative changes

375
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,100
that come in from a junior
admin who hits the wrong button

376
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,170
all the way through to nodes falling over

377
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,840
and having to repair themselves
through a software update.

378
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,880
All of these things come through

379
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,270
from the system out, not imperatively

380
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,430
from you getting paged
at two in the morning.

381
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,620
So the desired state is reconciled

382
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,110
by agents within the system.

383
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,450
This is probably the most
defining characteristic

384
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,107
of what a GitOps system is

385
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,457
and that's why Kubernetes
is such a good match.

386
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,850
So GitOps, using this
reference implementation,

387
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:10,260
we can work toward
building ideal platforms.

388
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,420
We can't build ideal
systems for everybody.

389
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,070
Everybody has different requirements,

390
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,650
but the platform can be an ideal.

391
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,380
And one of the things
we were motivated to do

392
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,810
earlier this year is
to see if we could find

393
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,290
some commonality and some
things that we could help

394
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,020
provide in EKS as native features

395
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,420
to help with this practice of GitOps

396
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,300
for workloads, for cloud resources,

397
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,580
and for clusters themselves.

398
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,950
You know, building a
fleet management system

399
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,690
has never been possible for us

400
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,670
because every other customer we talk to

401
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,680
has wildly different requirements.

402
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,680
So with this reference of
implementation being extensible,

403
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,310
you can actually your own

404
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,713
and we can help support you with that.

405
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,500
So GitOps works really well
and it is open source software

406
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,780
that's usually happening
on the Kubernetes cluster.

407
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,320
For example, Argo CD, you
might use ACK or Crossplane

408
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,800
for cloud resources or any
number of other solutions.

409
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,680
Argo CD is kind of a defacto standard.

410
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,270
So looking at the system, you'd say,

411
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,320
yes, okay, now we have manageable growth.

412
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,160
And you can add more clusters

413
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,080
and you can manage with
a single control plane

414
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,500
those deployments and you
can add more clusters.

415
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,260
And eventually we end up in this situation

416
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,260
where we're scaling out
decentralized GitOps environments,

417
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,890
which are based on open source

418
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,320
that you're self-managing in your clusters

419
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,813
and we're kind of back
in the same position.

420
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,860
So we see teams ending
up spending time here

421
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,210
and this is where the shift

422
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,153
to we need dedicated
platform teams comes in.

423
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,480
We end up managing the thing

424
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,300
that helps us abstract things away,

425
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,370
but we end up kind of having to manage

426
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,980
the problems with that
abstraction and then you end up

427
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,290
just chasing your own
tail and then you end up

428
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,813
with issues in a system like this as well.

429
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,140
So Kubernetes based platforms,

430
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,990
this is the way that you scale,

431
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,330
but we think that we have
a way to help you do it

432
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,120
a little more efficiently
with that foundational,

433
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
bespoke complexity being
something that we handle.

434
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,160
And if you look again back
at our feature evolution

435
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,970
this time thinking about
things in your cluster,

436
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,050
we start with Helm charts.

437
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,378
We point you to the CNCF
and say have a nice time.

438
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:30,123
There's 4,000 Helm charts, right?

439
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,410
EKS add-ons was a step
in the right direction,

440
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,370
just like managed no groups.

441
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,810
It puts a lifecycle API

442
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,530
around some of the most commonly
used operational add-ons.

443
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,853
So what comes next?

444
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,230
That's why we're really
excited to introduce you

445
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,510
to EKS capabilities.

446
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,530
So this is the first time

447
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,290
that EKS has had a new feature layer.

448
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,720
We expect a full part of
the roadmap dedicated here.

449
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,480
We're really excited
about this, that this,

450
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,660
we're moving beyond
managing cluster lifecycle

451
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,270
to also help you build
and scale with Kubernetes,

452
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,383
with your clusters.

453
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
So with EKS capabilities, you're able

454
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,140
to kind of click a button,
just start using these things.

455
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,290
They will evolve as you
evolve by using them.

456
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,040
We're gonna be adding more
features and more refinements,

457
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,550
but you'll be able to increase
your velocity from day one.

458
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,410
Remove some of that friction.

459
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,570
If you're just starting out
on your scaling journey,

460
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,040
this is a great place to start,

461
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,630
even if it feels like it's all too much

462
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,110
and you won't need it, if
you start using GitOps,

463
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,080
either open source, self-managed,
or with capabilities

464
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,640
with a few clicks of a button,

465
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,560
which we'll talk about
in a few moments here,

466
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,630
we'll dive into some of the details.

467
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,510
But starting here, means
you're ready for the future.

468
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,950
That means you won't ever have to do

469
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,840
that refactoring and figuring out

470
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,487
how to put all the fires
out while you're doing it.

471
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,010
You just start with these primitives

472
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,960
and you're ready to scale.

473
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,190
It's all open.

474
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,070
It's all based on
Kubernetes open standards.

475
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,560
Right now, the three
capabilities that we've launched

476
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,770
are all based on well-known
open source projects.

477
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,840
They're either defacto standards,

478
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,900
emerging kind of innovations

479
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,800
or things that AWS stands behind
with a capital S, support.

480
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,140
So these are all things
that customers already use

481
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,003
and are interested in using more of.

482
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,480
So Argo CD is where our
GitOps engine comes in.

483
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,480
This is used by most of our
customers practicing GitOps.

484
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,510
Argo CD has really emerged
as its own defacto standard

485
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,650
alongside of Kubernetes.

486
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,650
What we do see a lot is this
use of Argo CD is self-managed

487
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,670
and predominantly driven
out of the platform team.

488
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,830
A lot of customers actually use Argo CD

489
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,170
particularly for their platform

490
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,030
where their development customers
aren't actually using it

491
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,220
to deploy workloads at
all, using, you know,

492
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,500
imperative pipelines with
Bash scripts and Jenkins

493
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,910
has worked just fine.

494
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,910
And so we see this kind of
coming out of the platform team

495
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,203
and starting to evolve.

496
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,170
We also have ACK and Kro,

497
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,210
which gives us the infrastructure part.

498
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,430
Another piece that we see with customers

499
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,160
who are practicing GitOps
and some for years,

500
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,010
really enjoying it, having
a lot of success with it,

501
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,830
they stop short of managing
infrastructure with it.

502
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,120
They only work on, for
example, cluster add-ons

503
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,330
or maybe some just do internal workloads.

504
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,090
What we think the real
power in the system is

505
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,700
when you can bring cloud
infrastructure to the party

506
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,120
and start managing your clusters,
your workload resources,

507
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,543
everything together, so Kro
and ACK help you do that.

508
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,440
So really quickly, I just want to be clear

509
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,610
before we dig into some of
the details of how these work,

510
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,980
this is what a diagram might look like

511
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,130
for a self-managed platform
with these software components.

512
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,310
You see EKS runs the cluster for you.

513
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,860
In our account we run
the entire control plane.

514
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,940
If you're using auto mode,

515
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,070
we'll also manage your nodes for you

516
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,445
and in your account, your
Helm chart installing Argo CD,

517
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:06,870
ACK and Kro and you have
the CRDs to work with

518
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,650
and you're creating applications
and resources and instances

519
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,720
and therefore having S3 buckets

520
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,853
and RDS instances in your accounts.

521
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,500
With EKS capabilities, we are
running all of the controllers

522
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,480
and their dependencies
in our service accounts

523
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,700
just like we do the
cluster control planes.

524
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,530
So Argo CD, ACK and Kro are
fully run in EKS infrastructure.

525
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,630
They don't take up compute resources

526
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,700
and other resources in your clusters.

527
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,190
They free up your compute
and your pod slots

528
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,700
for your workloads and
we manage the lifecycle,

529
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,940
patching, scaling and the
resilience and availability

530
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,430
of your capabilities for you.

531
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,860
We do install the CRDs in your cluster

532
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,100
so you're still in full
control of your applications

533
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,280
and your ACK resources
and other custom resources

534
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,030
that come through the capabilities.

535
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,300
So our vision for this new feature layer

536
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,960
is shown through the
three initial capabilities

537
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,190
that we're offering.

538
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,750
They're all open standards,

539
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,180
they're Kubernetes native experiences,

540
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,800
which we think is very vital.

541
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
You're choosing to use Kubernetes,

542
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,550
whether you're starting
out and ready to scale

543
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,820
or you've been with us for
years, you're choosing it in part

544
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,410
because it is a standard.

545
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,880
You have a standardization layer,

546
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
you have multiple
environments, multiple teams

547
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,620
potentially deploying workloads

548
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,840
to multiple cloud environments or on-prem.

549
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,700
You want that standardization.

550
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,140
So it's very important to us

551
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,690
as we build more features
and into the future,

552
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,120
that those are portable for you as well.

553
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,040
We want to reduce friction.

554
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,640
So these will be always
fully managed for you.

555
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,900
There will never be a capability

556
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,390
that runs or deploys
things to your cluster.

557
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,070
However, we might have
additional CRDs in the cluster

558
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,070
to actually help accelerate velocity

559
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,800
and help you fine tune
your configurations.

560
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,830
So we'll talk about,
IAMRoleSelectors with ACK in a bit,

561
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,950
but there might be others
of those in the future.

562
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,830
And we're also really excited
about new innovations.

563
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,700
So Kro, bringing Kro into EKS capabilities

564
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,870
is really the first time
in EKS where we've offered,

565
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,970
you know, not GA software, right?

566
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,620
This is software that is evolving.

567
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,260
It's something that the
community's really excited about

568
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,170
as recently was donated
to SIG cloud provider.

569
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,170
So it's very visible in the
ecosystem, but it is not GA.

570
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,690
I will clarify that EKS
capabilities are GA,

571
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,970
our ability to manage
and run that software

572
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,700
for you on your behalf is
fully generally available

573
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,150
in all commercial regions,
that's available where EKS is.

574
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,800
However, what you might find

575
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,050
is that we will lean into new innovations

576
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,990
and new trends in the Kubernetes ecosystem

577
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,740
and this is a way for us to
be able to do that for you.

578
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:52,230
So I think I'm gonna pass
it to my colleague, Sriram

579
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,820
is gonna dig into the features

580
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,920
and talk a little bit about the details.

581
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,690
Thank you.
- Thanks Jesse.

582
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,710
Hey everyone. So what is EKS capabilities?

583
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,330
EKS capabilities is an extensible
set of platform features

584
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,090
that extend your EKS clusters.

585
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,492
Unlike self-managed installations,

586
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:14,940
AWS fully manages all
EKS capabilities for you.

587
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,090
What this means is you don't
have any operational overhead.

588
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,230
You don't have to worry about

589
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,560
installation, configuration,
patching, upgrades,

590
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,913
all of that is automatically
taken care of by AWS.

591
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,390
If you try to kubectl into
your Kubernetes cluster

592
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,940
and try to find Argo CD controllers

593
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,070
or let's say for example ACK controllers,

594
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,630
you're not going to find them.

595
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,350
They run in AWS own service
accounts, they're fully managed

596
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,650
and that's why you won't
be able to find them.

597
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,520
How do you go about creating a capability?

598
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,860
All capabilities follow a common pattern

599
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,930
when it comes to creation.

600
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,400
When you create a capability,

601
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,460
you first have to identify
which capability you want,

602
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,230
you have to give it a name

603
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,660
so that you can refer to it later.

604
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,160
You have to decide which cluster

605
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,500
you want to enable the capability on,

606
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,490
and then you have to
pass an capability role.

607
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,870
Depending on the capability,

608
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,090
there might be some additional
configurations needed.

609
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,123
We will touch upon those as
we go through the next slides.

610
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,510
And just to note, all
of these capabilities

611
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,340
can be created using multiple modes.

612
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,810
You can do it through the CLI,

613
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,660
you can do it through eksctl,
any of your favorite IAC tools

614
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,360
or through the EKS console,
there are no restrictions.

615
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,550
So when we built EKS capabilities,

616
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,040
we have introduced a new service principle

617
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
that you see on screen here.

618
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,610
When you create the capability role,

619
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,520
you need to ensure that the trust policy

620
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,580
trusts this particular service principle.

621
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,370
This is key. It's not your OIDC provider.

622
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,730
It is the EKS capability
service principle.

623
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,060
You can always scope this
down to specific resources

624
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,923
by adding additional conditions.

625
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,680
Once you're done with the trust policy

626
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,500
now comes the time for permissions.

627
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,020
Depending on how you want
to use the capabilities

628
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,940
and what integrations you want,

629
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,130
you might need to add certain permissions

630
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,410
for each of the capability roles.

631
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,060
In case of Argo CD,

632
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,790
depending on if your source is coming from

633
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,540
let's say CodeCommit or from
ECR or from CodeConnections,

634
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,090
you have to give it
appropriate permissions.

635
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,500
With ACK, depending on the
AWS resources you plan to use,

636
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,500
you have to correspondingly
give the underlying permissions.

637
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,020
As an example, if you plan to use S3,

638
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,490
then you need to give S3 permissions.

639
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,703
If you plan to use RDS, you
need to give it RDS permissions.

640
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,140
With Kro, there are no
specific permissions required.

641
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,600
It is confined to the Kubernetes cluster,

642
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,920
but let's say for example,

643
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,113
if you plan to use ACK along with Kro,

644
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,600
then you need to make sure

645
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,600
that whatever AWS resources
are governed by the Kro RGD.

646
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,000
You have to give the
corresponding permissions

647
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,573
to the ACKs capability rule,
not to the Kro capability rule.

648
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,890
We will walk through hands-on examples

649
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,990
of three EKS capabilities.

650
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,063
Argo CD for automation
with deep AWS integration,

651
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:16,320
ACK for infrastructure provisioning

652
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,350
with scoped flexible IAM roles,

653
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,590
Kro for creating platform abstractions.

654
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,120
These are the building blocks

655
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,493
you decide how you want to use them.

656
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,320
What is Argo CD?

657
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I know Jesse touched briefly
upon what is Argo CD.

658
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,130
Argo CD is a GitOps based
continuous deployment tool.

659
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,920
Your Git repository becomes
the source of truth.

660
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,010
And Argo CD ensures that
your cluster state matches

661
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,570
what you have defined in Git,
it supports drift detection

662
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,300
and automatic reconciliation,
what I mean by that

663
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,120
is if you go and make
an imperative change,

664
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,430
Argo CD can automatically detect it

665
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,800
and make sure that it brings
back your system state

666
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,950
back to the desired state
so that there is no drift.

667
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,990
You have options to turn that off,

668
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,573
but it is typically not the best practice.

669
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,850
One of the good things about
Argo CD is it lets you connect

670
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,360
a central Argo CD instance to
multiple different clusters.

671
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,860
So if you have applications

672
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,500
that needs to get deployed
to different clusters,

673
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,710
you can always do that
from a central cluster.

674
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,480
In this illustration, we
have the EKS capability,

675
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,400
which is an Argo CD capability
enabled on a central cluster

676
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,070
and you can connect multiple
different EKS clusters

677
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,320
and push your deployments to it.

678
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,153
The good thing is

679
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:40,620
these EKS clusters can
be in the same account,

680
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,440
different account, same
region, different region.

681
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,370
It does not matter.

682
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,220
You can connect to any EKS
cluster within your portfolio.

683
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,100
Typically, when you're connecting

684
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,860
to multiple different EKS
clusters and different accounts,

685
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,807
different VPCs, different regions,

686
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:58,110
you need to worry about the
networking aspect of it.

687
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,970
How do you do VPC pairing?

688
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,190
How do you set up transit gateways?

689
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,130
The cool thing about EKS capabilities

690
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,330
is you don't have to worry about any of it

691
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,220
that is fully managed for you.

692
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,470
You don't have to worry about
how to reach the clusters

693
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,060
we take care of that for you.

694
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,040
You just need to give us the cluster route

695
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,640
and we establish the connection.

696
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,180
Here is a specific example
of how do you go about

697
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,270
creating the actual Argo CD capability.

698
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,020
Here we have the type of
capability set as Argo CD.

699
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,800
We give it a name, we identify the cluster

700
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,450
to which Argo CD should be enabled on.

701
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,530
There is a role ARN,

702
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,530
which is nothing but the
Argo CD capability role

703
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,360
and in this particular case

704
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,583
we also have an additional configuration.

705
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,190
AWS EKS Argo CD capability is integrated

706
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,200
with AWS Identity Center.

707
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,750
This is how we enable single sign-on

708
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,970
for your Argo UI and Argo CLI.

709
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,120
So you need to ensure that
your identity center is enabled

710
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,730
and you pass on the identity
center configuration

711
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,580
when you are creating the capability.

712
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,460
This illustration is showing

713
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,680
how you can create the
same Argo CD capability,

714
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,630
if you're more comfortable with Console,

715
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,700
you can do it through the
Console, it's pretty simple.

716
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,040
Most of the information
is prefilled for you.

717
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,420
You just select the role,

718
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,380
select the identity center
provider and you click on next

719
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,440
and the capability will
get created for you.

720
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,810
In case you don't have a
role already available.

721
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,460
There is also a nice option available

722
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,800
wherein you can create the role directly

723
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,870
through the Console itself.

724
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,180
It is mainly for getting
started experience.

725
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,860
If you want, you can always scope it down

726
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,050
when you're going through
the role creation process,

727
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,120
but if you are okay with the
getting started experience,

728
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,170
you don't have to change anything.

729
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,280
Everything is prefilled for you.

730
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,347
You just need to agree to
it and it creates the role

731
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:45,197
and automatically selects it for you.

732
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,060
Once you create the role,
this is where you will land.

733
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,770
It gives you basic details about okay,

734
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,060
what is this capability?

735
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,027
When was it created? What is
the IAM corresponding to it?

736
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:02,640
And if there are any health issues or not.

737
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
At the top right corner you
see the capability issues.

738
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,950
If let's say, for example,
for whatever reason

739
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,290
you ran into an error or
degraded, you can click on it

740
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,810
and it'll give you details in
terms of what was the error

741
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,260
and how to recover from that.

742
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,940
Argo CD is fully managed

743
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,793
but you still have access
to your favorite Argos UI.

744
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,760
You also have access to Argo CLI.

745
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,290
You can configure that

746
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,480
from Argo UI perspective,
you don't have to anything.

747
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,760
We provide you the hyperlink
from the EKS Console.

748
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,040
You just click on it, you
enter your credentials

749
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,960
and you're logged into the Argo UI.

750
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,070
So there are no restrictions

751
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,840
compared to what you would do, typically,

752
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,490
with a self-managed installation.

753
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,380
Now that we have created the capability,

754
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,580
let's dive deeper into some
of the Argo CD core resources.

755
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,120
One of the main resources
from an Argo CD perspective

756
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,860
is the application resource.

757
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,230
The application resource typically tells

758
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,390
where my source code needs to come from

759
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,550
and which cluster is it destined to.

760
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,450
In this case, we have the
source coming from myRepo

761
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,550
and it is going to the demo cluster.

762
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,320
But what exactly is demo cluster?

763
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,610
How does Argo CD know

764
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,580
what this random string called
demo cluster really means?

765
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,870
Let's put a pin on it.

766
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,190
It'll become evidently clear

767
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,260
as we go through the next slides.

768
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,300
There's also an attribute
called (indistinct).

769
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,220
Again, I want to put a pin on it.

770
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,140
In subsequent slides we will cover

771
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,413
how project plays a role
in this entire setup.

772
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,880
Anytime you want to use a
cluster as a valid target

773
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,020
for your Argo CD, you need to
first register it with Argo CD

774
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,570
and how do you register
your cluster with Argo CD?

775
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,070
You create a Kubernetes secret

776
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,820
and pass the special label
that you see on screen here.

777
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,110
You give the cluster

778
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,930
and name the demo cluster
which we previously referenced.

779
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,890
So this is where the mapping
between the actual cluster

780
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,060
to the ARN happens.

781
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,070
In a typical self-managed installation.

782
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,960
Instead of the ARN, you'll be providing

783
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,090
the Kubernetes API server URL.

784
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,470
With EKS managed capabilities,

785
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,880
you don't have to worry about the URL,

786
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,433
you can just specify
the ARN and it'll work.

787
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,530
Similar to the clusters

788
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,640
we also need to register
all of our source repos

789
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,310
and how do you go about
registering the source repos?

790
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,180
The same as clusters.

791
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,200
You create another secret in
Kubernetes of type repository

792
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,480
and you will be able to connect to any

793
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,220
of your private GitHub,
GitLab or Bitbucket clusters.

794
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,950
The good thing about
that is EKS capabilities

795
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,830
comes integrated with AWS Secrets Manager.

796
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,460
So if you want to store
all of your Git secrets

797
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,530
in Secrets Manager, you can store that

798
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,750
and just reference the
Secrets Manager ARN.

799
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,910
What this means is we do not pull any

800
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,560
of the Secrets Manager credentials

801
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,760
into the cluster and store it.

802
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,640
It is just read at runtime authenticated

803
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,383
and it remains in Secrets Manager.

804
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,100
Typically, in a production environment,

805
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,790
you do not want everyone deploying
any quote to any cluster.

806
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,373
There needs to be certain
security guardrails.

807
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,950
App project is the way how Argo
CD enforces this constraints

808
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,810
app project, you can think about it

809
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,510
as what are my valid source repos

810
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,073
where the code can come from?

811
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,240
What are my valid destination clusters

812
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,040
where my source code can reach?

813
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,140
And who can really deploy those?

814
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,360
And that is defined by the Argo RBAC

815
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,800
that is highlighted here.

816
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,830
So Argo CD app project
acts as the container

817
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,233
which gives you that security boundaries.

818
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,030
Next, take a look at some of
the EKS specific integrations

819
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,790
that comes with the Argo CD capability.

820
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,320
In this particular case,

821
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,500
we are pulling a Helm chart from ECR.

822
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,150
So if you see the repos URL,

823
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,050
it's not a GitHub URL
instead it is an OCI URL.

824
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,130
What this really means

825
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,910
is with respect to any of
the EKS specific integrations

826
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,640
like ECR, you do not really have to create

827
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,790
a repository secret or do
the credential managements.

828
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,730
The capability IAM role can
automatically authenticate

829
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,720
into your ECR repository
and pull your Helm charts

830
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,863
into your cluster.

831
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,970
With self-managed installations,

832
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,380
that is not going to happen.

833
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,090
You have to install the repository secret

834
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,240
and worry about the
credentials management.

835
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,912
The same thing goes with AWS CodeCommit.

836
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:33,090
AWS CodeCommit, you again specify

837
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,370
just the URL of CodeCommit

838
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,860
the IAM role can automatically
authenticate into it.

839
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,900
You don't have to worry
about credential management

840
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,603
or creating any of the repository secrets.

841
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,670
There's one more integration that we have

842
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,593
it's called AWS CodeConnections.

843
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:54,110
CodeConnections lets you
connect to your GitHub, GitLab

844
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,400
or Bitbucket without managing

845
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,830
personal access tokens or secrets.

846
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,260
The way it works is
through an OAuth handshake.

847
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,800
You need to first register it
once with your Git provider

848
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,450
and once the authentication
is established,

849
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,830
you can directly reference it

850
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,800
from your Argo CD applications.

851
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,900
Again, the authentication's
automatically handled for you.

852
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,610
You don't have to create the credentials,

853
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,160
you don't have to worry
about managing the secrets.

854
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,350
So what are the key takeaways?

855
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,340
The key differentiators is
there is direct integration

856
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,490
with multiple AWS services
like Secrets Manager.

857
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,690
There is ECR CodeCommit,
CodeConnection, so it simplifies

858
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,760
how you connect to different
source repositories

859
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,470
to the Argo CD instance.

860
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,713
This is unique to EKS
capability for Argo CD.

861
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,497
Now let's take a look at what is ACK?

862
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:52,150
ACK or AWS Controllers for Kubernetes

863
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,440
let's you manage AWS
resources using Kubernetes

864
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,490
custom resources alongside
your applications.

865
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,390
Define an S3 bucket or an
RDS database in a YAML file

866
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,370
and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster.

867
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,500
And ACK handles the rest for you

868
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,058
of provisioning those resources.

869
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,990
ACK is again built on GitOps principles

870
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,300
with continuous drift
detection and reconciliation.

871
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,890
So ACK can always make sure

872
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,720
that whatever you have defined

873
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,360
within your Kubernetes
cluster is a source of truth

874
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,680
and when something deviates,

875
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,780
it can bring it back to the desired state.

876
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,560
How do we go about
creating an ACK capability?

877
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,760
Like we previously said,

878
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,850
all the capabilities follow
the same creation pattern.

879
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,860
You tell what type of capability you want,

880
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,480
which cluster you want it on.

881
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,490
What is the name of the capability

882
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,093
and what is the IAM role that
the capability should assume.

883
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,190
This is just showing it
through the Console as well.

884
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,423
I will quickly skip it.

885
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,230
Here is an example of an ACK resource.

886
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,020
In this case, we are
creating an S3 bucket.

887
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,853
If you look at it,

888
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,900
it just looks like any
other Kubernetes resource,

889
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,420
but if you note the kind is bucket.

890
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,593
Bucket is not a native API
that is supported by Kubernetes

891
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:11,790
it is a custom resource

892
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,610
and this is enabled by the ACK controllers

893
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,760
that are enabled by the ACK capability.

894
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,537
So once you apply this
particular Kubernetes

895
00:40:19,537 --> 00:40:21,950
YAML tier cluster, it is
basically going to create

896
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,480
an S3 bucket with the name
that you have specified

897
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,430
and the policies that you
have defined for versioning

898
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,563
and blocking the public access.

899
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:33,090
IAMRoleSelector.

900
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,360
IAMRoleSelector is a
really important concept

901
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,030
for sophisticated ACK deployments.

902
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,810
It lets you map multiple
different IAM roles

903
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,490
to different name spaces.

904
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,330
It also enables cross
region resource management,

905
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,660
team isolation and
least privileged access.

906
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,950
The IAM role you specify here
is used by matching namespace.

907
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,560
In this case the ACK target account role

908
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,900
is used by namespace, which is production.

909
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
And anything starting with broad hyphen,

910
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,540
if you do not want namespace
specific roles, it's fine.

911
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,830
Just get rid of the namespace selector

912
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,870
and it'll apply cluster wide.

913
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,040
It's completely flexible.

914
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,090
It's up to you how you want to manage it.

915
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,290
Let's say you want to do cross region

916
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,880
deployments using ACK.

917
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,700
It is as simple as just
specifying the annotation

918
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,220
for the region and the sources

919
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,560
will be automatically provisioned

920
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,243
in the corresponding regions.

921
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,560
Let's say you have Kubernetes cluster,

922
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,690
there are multiple teams working on it.

923
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,600
They all have different
resources, different requirements

924
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,540
for spinning up different
resources within AWS

925
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,520
and they all need different permissions.

926
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,080
How do you go about doing it?

927
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,340
You basically can define

928
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,970
multiple different IAMRoleSelector
have multiple roles

929
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,772
and assign them to different name spaces.

930
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:57,263
Kubernetes RBAC Controls, who
has access to those different

931
00:41:57,263 --> 00:41:59,970
namespaces and IAM permissions controls,

932
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,680
what resources they can spin?

933
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,150
So this way you can also operate

934
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,663
a multi-tenant ACK environment
in a single cluster.

935
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,843
Key takeaways from an Argo CD perspective.

936
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,830
So we have seen key two
capabilities so far.

937
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,443
One is Argo CD and the other one is ACK,

938
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,710
Argo CD handles the application deployment

939
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,814
with direct AWS integrations.

940
00:42:24,814 --> 00:42:26,790
ACK handles infrastructure provisioning

941
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,850
with sophisticated IAM patterns.

942
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,490
This covers the deployment
and infrastructure,

943
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,560
but developers still need to worry about

944
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,150
the underlying resources.

945
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,600
How do we abstract that
for our developers?

946
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,163
And that's why Kro comes in.

947
00:42:44,026 --> 00:42:46,890
Kro also known as Kube
Resource Orchestrator

948
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,700
let's platform teams create
custom Kubernetes APIs

949
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,250
by composing existing resources.

950
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,250
Think about it this way, if
you have a web application,

951
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,680
a web application could be
composed of a deployment,

952
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,830
a service, an ingress,
it can have an S3 bucket

953
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,453
and an RDS database.

954
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,263
Today, developers need to
know about all of that.

955
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,920
Would it not be convenient if
you can combine all of them

956
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,740
into one entity and call
it as web application?

957
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,530
So platform teams can create
a new customer resource

958
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,070
using Kro on the fly
called as web application

959
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,710
and they just allow certain things

960
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,930
to be configurable by the developers.

961
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,900
Developers do not need to know
the underlying complexity.

962
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,780
They can just create instances
out of the web application

963
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,930
by passing some basic
parameters using simple YAML

964
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,160
and they don't have to worry about

965
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,933
any of the underlying complexity.

966
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,160
Creating a Kro capability
is similar to what we saw

967
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,420
with the ACK capability.

968
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm not going to dive into the details.

969
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,530
Only changes, the type of the capability

970
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,743
is going to be Kro in this
case instead of Argo CD or ACK.

971
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,490
The same thing can be
done through Console.

972
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,410
I'm going to quickly skip that.

973
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,900
And now we come to
resource graph definition,

974
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,613
which is the core to how Kube
Resource Orchestrator works.

975
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,800
The resource graph definition

976
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,530
is where platform teams
define custom APIs.

977
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,380
You encode your best practices here.

978
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,820
The schema section defines

979
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,770
what field developers can configure.

980
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,380
In this case, they can
specify the app name,

981
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,780
the number of replicas of the web app

982
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,350
and whether they need
an RDS database or not.

983
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:29,448
The resources section
defines what gets created.

984
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:33,600
The RGD creates a web
application resource type

985
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,073
in this particular case.

986
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,130
This is what developers
really need to create.

987
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,710
The platform engineers
have created the RGD.

988
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,020
When developers need to
create a web application,

989
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,490
it's as simple as this, they come,

990
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,460
they create a custom resource
of type web application.

991
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,390
They specify the name, they
tell how many replicas they need

992
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,430
and whether they need the database or not.

993
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,080
And you can make this as simple

994
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,763
and as sophisticated as you want.

995
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,450
Kro also empowers you

996
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,520
with the power of prescriptive patterns.

997
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,250
Developers only need to know, to specify,

998
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,370
let's say the name and region
when creating an S3 bucket.

999
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,570
In this particular case,

1000
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,680
an S3 bucket is embedded
within a Kro RGD definition

1001
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,810
with all the best practices built in.

1002
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,300
The platform team has
already encoded saying that

1003
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,510
whenever somebody in my
organization creates an S3 bucket,

1004
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,640
it needs to come with versioning enabled.

1005
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,370
The lifecycle policies
for cost optimization,

1006
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,550
public access is blocked
and encryption is enabled.

1007
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,900
So if you really think about it,

1008
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,840
these settings are immutable
from a developer perspective.

1009
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,280
They create the S3 bucket,

1010
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,100
but the best practices are
already encoded for you.

1011
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,750
When the platform administration team

1012
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,603
has distributed the different RGDs.

1013
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,720
Let's say you need to make an update

1014
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,050
as part of platform engineering
to your existing RGD

1015
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,220
and you want to change
the lifecycle policy

1016
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,410
of retention from 90 days to 30 days

1017
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,000
and add intelligent tiering,

1018
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,490
you make the change to RGD,
deploy to your clusters.

1019
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,060
All the underlying resources
automatically get the updates.

1020
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,460
It's completely opaque.

1021
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,200
Completely opaque from
a developer standpoint

1022
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,900
as they do not even know
that the change has happened.

1023
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,470
Versioning resource cloud definition means

1024
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,650
that platform teams can evolve
their abstractions over time

1025
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,620
and this is very critical
for large organizations

1026
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,560
with many teams with
backward compatibility.

1027
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,863
Standards are enforced through
code and not documentation.

1028
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,070
One of the cool things about Kro

1029
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,730
is that it comes with something
called a CEL expressions.

1030
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,220
CEL expressions is how you embed logic

1031
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,410
into your resource graph definition.

1032
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,770
As you see here, in this
resource graph definition

1033
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,270
for your production and environment,

1034
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:04,650
it comes with larger DB instance
sizes with multi AZ enabled

1035
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,670
and also the backup
retention is for 30 days

1036
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,370
as against seven days for
non-production environments.

1037
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,160
So you can quote this kind
of logic within your RGDs

1038
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,950
depending on the type of
instances that created,

1039
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,803
it'll make sure that these
policies are applied for you.

1040
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,140
With independent customer resources,

1041
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,780
customers would need to
work out of the order

1042
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,230
of these resources, inject
configuration across them

1043
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,173
and create custom patterns
for teams to consume.

1044
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,959
Now let's see how that changes with Kro.

1045
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:44,520
With Kro you can easily
create composable abstractions

1046
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,710
and group different resources together.

1047
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,320
So if there are certain resources
that need to get created

1048
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,350
before other resources,
you can control the order.

1049
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,970
In this case, let's say for example,

1050
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,840
the VPC needs to be created
before the cluster gets created.

1051
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,280
You can control that,

1052
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,010
so that Kro waits for
the VPC to be created

1053
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,610
grabs the VPC ID, passes on
to the EKS cluster creation

1054
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,623
before the EKS cluster gets created.

1055
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,860
All these three capabilities work together

1056
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,890
to create a complete platform
engineering solution.

1057
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,970
Kro provides the abstraction layer.

1058
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,720
ACK handles AWS resource provisioning.

1059
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,728
Argo CD handles the GitHubs deployment.

1060
00:48:30,728 --> 00:48:34,620
IAMRoleSelector ensures
proper permissions.

1061
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,027
This is modern platform
engineering in AWS.

1062
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,140
What are the key takeaways?

1063
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,690
These features demonstrate
why EKS capabilities

1064
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,330
is more than just manage installations.

1065
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,580
They provide deep AWS integrations

1066
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,650
and sophisticated IAM patterns

1067
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,680
that aren't available with
self-managed solutions.

1068
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,373
This is infrastructure
management designed for AWS.

1069
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,860
With that, I will pass it on to Jesse

1070
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,363
to cover the next slides.

1071
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:11,390
- Thanks, Sriram.

1072
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:15,180
Hey, thanks everybody for
kind of following along

1073
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,740
with all of the how to get started

1074
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,110
and watching all of the details fly by.

1075
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,960
I wanted to call out that
we have documentation,

1076
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,610
we have blogs, we have these things

1077
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,500
you don't have to
actually remember at all.

1078
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,480
There's a lot to cover as well,

1079
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,910
which we're just sort of
touching the surface here.

1080
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:34,170
So I think we'll have more
content as we move forward

1081
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,820
and we'll have workshops
and things like that.

1082
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,347
So I just wanted to call that out

1083
00:49:37,347 --> 00:49:39,930
and we're giving a very
high level treatment.

1084
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,540
As part of that, before
you leave the room today,

1085
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,370
I wanted to give you some considerations

1086
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,380
when you're thinking about capabilities,

1087
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,810
you know primarily like which
ones you'd want to choose

1088
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,220
for which types of workloads

1089
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,340
or what type of requirements you have,

1090
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,280
what your governance
and operational model is

1091
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,380
or you want it to be.

1092
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,560
What multi cluster system
designs might look like

1093
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,680
and how that impacts
multi-tenancy considerations.

1094
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,830
And also like permissions,
lease privilege principle

1095
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,950
and things like that where you
want to actually plan ahead

1096
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,830
before you start clicking
buttons and onboarding teams.

1097
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,170
How do you want to
manage those permissions

1098
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,060
and how do you want to
design that into the future

1099
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,470
so you can scale.

1100
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,630
And obviously there's considerations on

1101
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,600
using self-managed open source components

1102
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,060
versus using capabilities.

1103
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,650
So these are all things that
you should be thinking about

1104
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,850
as you start kicking the tires

1105
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,130
and looking at this set of features.

1106
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,070
So EKS services are
designed to interoperate,

1107
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,750
but they're not required to do so.

1108
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,370
This is the first thing to think about.

1109
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,860
If you only want to use Argo CD, you can.

1110
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,350
If you're only interested
in Kro, that's fine.

1111
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,910
These are designed to work together,

1112
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,470
but they're all independent.

1113
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,780
We also support any compute type on EKS,

1114
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,790
whether it's hybrid nodes, auto mode

1115
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,430
or self-managed nodes,
anything in between.

1116
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,030
So there's some really powerful stuff

1117
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,610
when you can hit a button in
the console, click a few more

1118
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,490
and have an auto mode cluster
with all three capabilities,

1119
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,990
but you don't need to
use auto mode with it.

1120
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,200
You see, these are all kind
of our primitive features

1121
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,700
are meant for you to design

1122
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,450
and build the system that you need.

1123
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,500
So operational model is
probably the biggest thing

1124
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,260
you wanna look at as you
start automating a lot more

1125
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,080
of your infrastructure and your workloads.

1126
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,450
So centralized management

1127
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,300
is sort of the classic
platform engineering model

1128
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,370
where we see their
centralized management cluster

1129
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,860
or fleets of management clusters.

1130
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,840
We're working to orchestrate workloads

1131
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,670
and multiple cloud resources
across the workload clusters.

1132
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,430
So your onboard teams
probably into name spaces

1133
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,470
or other type of tenancy model

1134
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,020
and you're gonna be
provisioning AWS resources

1135
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,320
and clusters through
the management cluster

1136
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,790
or management clusters,

1137
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:55,440
This can really simplify
operation for teams,

1138
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,970
but it's a bit more of a burden

1139
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,630
on a platform engineering
dedicated investment.

1140
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,750
Whereas decentralized might
help you actually achieve

1141
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,580
a little more velocity upfront.

1142
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,060
But there are trade offs to
consider around each cluster

1143
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,270
and each team having
some amount of autonomy.

1144
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,360
Can you keep compliance in check?

1145
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,980
Can you do your audits right?

1146
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,530
That's where actually
GitOps comes in really handy

1147
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,320
as far as the extensibility of that system

1148
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,320
being literally anything, it's all in Git

1149
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,080
it's all verifiable and it's
all immutable artifacts.

1150
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,450
So you kind of get the
best of both worlds here

1151
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,200
where you can start fast, but
you can keep it on the rails.

1152
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,020
So I think the thing to
think primarily about is

1153
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,750
how many teams do you have, will you have,

1154
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,350
and how much autonomy might
they need in the future?

1155
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,080
Multi cluster system designs is sort of

1156
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,170
the bread and butter of
modern platform engineering.

1157
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,230
With Kubernetes having that
management control plane,

1158
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,130
what does that look like?

1159
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,890
There's hub and spoke and
there's local cluster.

1160
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,290
So these are really the two options.

1161
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:03,290
Primarily we see, most
very scaled customers

1162
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,060
with very mature large
platform engineering teams

1163
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,660
prefer hub and spoke, because
it centralizes operations

1164
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,570
and costs around managing
these components.

1165
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,390
Whereas with local cluster
we see that a lot more

1166
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:18,300
with scaling platform engineering efforts

1167
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,110
or when a large organization
has multiple efforts

1168
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,660
that are all working
independently from each other,

1169
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,120
you know, potentially
different business units.

1170
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,770
There's trade-offs here to consider,

1171
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,090
particularly around scale and
how much you expect a team

1172
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,760
to be able to take on operational burden

1173
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,640
until it starts becoming a situation

1174
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,640
where your small decentralized
teams start building

1175
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,460
their own dedicated platform
engineering efforts,

1176
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,140
that probably isn't ideal.

1177
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,420
So those are the trade-offs
you look at for scale now,

1178
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,863
but also into the future.

1179
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,713
It's really, really important
to respect both IAM and RBAC

1180
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:57,450
and the cluster, how they work together,

1181
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,400
especially bringing Argo CD to the party

1182
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,010
that has additional RBAC controls.

1183
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,700
When you want to, think
about this in a continuum

1184
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,720
of defense in depth, but also
just in specification, right?

1185
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,080
Think about IAM as in the capability role

1186
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,000
and in other roles that
you would use potentially

1187
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,480
with IAMRoleSelector as
granting service permissions

1188
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,830
to the capability.

1189
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,140
This is what the capability can do

1190
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,150
or can be configured to do

1191
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,640
versus the controls in the cluster

1192
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,390
about who can do what,
where, pardon my voice.

1193
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,870
So this RBAC is gonna control
the Kubernetes resources

1194
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,700
and where they can be created.

1195
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,070
These are intimately connected,

1196
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,920
particularly if an Argo CD application

1197
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,510
defines a Kro specification,
which creates ACK resources.

1198
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:48,060
Now you're talking about
anyone with access to be able

1199
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,790
to create that resource in your cluster.

1200
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,290
Having access to create

1201
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,423
those AWS resources in your accounts.

1202
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,360
This is transparent and it's very obvious

1203
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,650
probably to us sitting in the room,

1204
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,570
but it's something to
really get fluent with

1205
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,880
when you start designing
out systems at scale,

1206
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,780
it's very powerful.

1207
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,590
It's just like Terraform
or Ansible and Salt

1208
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,690
and you know things before it.

1209
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,120
It's when you think about
infrastructure as code,

1210
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,300
you're really talking about
taking the keys to the kingdom

1211
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,580
and putting them at somebody's keyboard.

1212
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,260
So you have to think about that.

1213
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,097
With Kubernetes RBAC,

1214
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:22,950
you have that little next level of defense

1215
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,950
saying the system can
do these things in AWS,

1216
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,830
but only these personas and
principles in the cluster

1217
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,663
can do them.

1218
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,050
The key takeaways on all
of these observations,

1219
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,300
and there's many more, we're
actually gonna be building

1220
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,510
some of these considerations
into extensive narratives

1221
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,613
and guidance for our best practices guide.

1222
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,300
The things to take away right now

1223
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,190
as you start looking at
this and thinking about

1224
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,490
how you might be able to use
it either as a scaling customer

1225
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:54,060
or somebody with a mature
platform effort already

1226
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,330
is how you want to simplify operations.

1227
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,950
Is it simpler for you to have

1228
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,010
a push button GitOps for
teams to get started?

1229
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,050
Do prescriptive resources
actually make sense

1230
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:08,880
to put teams on the rails
for some self-service, right?

1231
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,770
Or do you actually need to

1232
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,900
potentially for regulated
workload requirements

1233
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,490
or just organizational standards,

1234
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,280
do you need to consolidate
into a platform team?

1235
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,590
If you already have a mature platform team

1236
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,090
are you planning for scale?

1237
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,830
Do you know where you're headed?

1238
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,810
And can capabilities help offload some

1239
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,700
of the foundational pieces?

1240
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,380
Likely, if you're a mature platform team,

1241
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,660
you already have an enormous amount

1242
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,380
of differentiated value
built into your platform

1243
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,140
that we would never presume to replace,

1244
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,750
but these foundational
components can maybe free you up

1245
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,050
for building more of that.

1246
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:47,400
Ultimately, you wanna build
and ship faster and safer.

1247
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,150
So with EKS capabilities,
this is our next step

1248
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,400
and our next set of evolution of features

1249
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,450
to help you do that.

1250
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,640
We are continuing to execute,

1251
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,860
which is one of the reasons
I love being in this service

1252
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,160
still after six years,
we're continuing to execute

1253
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,830
on this vision to help you focus

1254
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,230
on building and shipping software

1255
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:10,650
and not on managing the
small pieces of a cluster

1256
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:13,110
that all of your colleagues
at the conference

1257
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,280
also have to do.

1258
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,350
Anything that we find as a commonality

1259
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,960
we're gonna try and do on your behalf.

1260
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,350
So you can offload that
undifferentiated heavy lifting to us

1261
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,700
and you can focus on your
differentiated value.

1262
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,480
So before we leave, I wanted to call out

1263
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,610
some additional sessions at the conference

1264
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,170
and some resources.

1265
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,790
So there's some sessions here

1266
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,830
that are worth taking a look at

1267
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,080
builder session and two workshops.

1268
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,540
These are gonna be foundational GitOps

1269
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,150
and platform engineering content for you.

1270
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,410
I believe these workshops,

1271
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,420
some of them are self-driven as well.

1272
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,320
We have a ton of workshop
content and learning materials

1273
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,250
through our websites and
also session resources.

1274
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,890
We always have our documentation,

1275
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,870
EKS workshop, EKS blueprints.

1276
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:58,890
These are all of the things

1277
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,270
that come along with the service.

1278
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,310
We support all of these directly.

1279
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:05,250
So if you ever have ideas for new content

1280
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,560
or you find yourself looking
and want to learn something

1281
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,120
that we're not quite covering,

1282
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,360
let us know and we're happy
to help you with that.

1283
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,430
Thank you so much. Thanks
for taking your time.

1284
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,040
I hope the rest of the
conference is great for you.

1285
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,180
If you see us in the hall,

1286
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,550
please flag us down and
we're happy to talk.

1287
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:21,383
Thanks a lot.
