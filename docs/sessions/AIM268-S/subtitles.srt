1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,500
- My name is Amit Kinha.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,450
I'm the field CTO at DoiT,

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,670
where we specialize in
helping cloud ops and FinOps

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,720
with many of our customers

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,660
getting the true value of the cloud out.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,740
Previously joining DoiT,

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,440
I was a director of
cloud FinOps at Citibank,

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,790
where for a number of years,

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,360
I led our practice around cloud FinOps.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,920
And when you think about FinOps,

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,830
oftentimes if you ask, say,
four people in the room today,

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,360
you might get eight
different answers, right?

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,010
You might get answers around,

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,760
well, we help with optimization,

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,740
we help with things like the savings plans

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,910
at the end of the day,

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,820
we might also be doing
some sort of ETL things,

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,010
and we might be building
a lot of reports, right?

19
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,570
And a lot of dashboards.

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,190
And while all of that was true,

21
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,200
the thing that I found I
was doing the most often

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,630
which moved the needle was really around

23
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,400
building confidence in the cloud.

24
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,670
When a managing director would see a bill

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,740
they didn't really understand,

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,120
and they're panicking about it,

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,790
sitting down with them and
helping them understand that,

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,440
yeah, the bill went up $500,000

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,880
for their product in the last month,

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,710
but that's not really a negative thing

31
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,110
because look at the revenue
that they got out of it.

32
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,950
Or cloud is elastic, and
so budgets are really hard,

33
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,210
but that's not a negative thing either

34
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,160
because that means we're really paying

35
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,630
for the things we're using.

36
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,350
And what I found was
oftentimes this confidence

37
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,170
I'm describing is what
FinOps was really about.

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,750
It was not about the ETL
pipelines that I'd be fixing

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,420
or looking at our payer accounts

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,300
and trying to organize
tags forever and ever.

41
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,650
We're really around how do we get people

42
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,570
to get confidence that the stuff

43
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,180
that they're actually doing
in the cloud is A, efficient,

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,390
B, that the value they're
getting back is really immediate,

45
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,460
and finally, getting the
data to the right people

46
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,750
at the right time.

47
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,460
Oftentimes reports that we would generate

48
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,420
would either go static

49
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,150
or oftentimes it felt
like a very ad hoc thing.

50
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,640
Someone would come to my team to ask about

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,290
what can we do about FinOps?

52
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,840
I see my bill is creeping up every month,

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,340
and I'm not really sure

54
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,380
whether it's a good or bad thing there.

55
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,560
So what I coined the
term here is FinOps 3.0,

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,420
where we get to a place where

57
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,100
we're no longer just
looking at dashboards,

58
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,540
we're no longer just looking at tagging

59
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,550
or anomalies without context,

60
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,550
but we're in a place where
it's a cohesive whole.

61
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,740
So talk about 3.0, I guess
we should take a step back

62
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,950
and well, what the hell is
3.0 in the first place, right?

63
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,630
And I think about it this way,

64
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,030
1.0 was all about visibility.

65
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,100
And this is where we
started thinking about,

66
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,010
we have many different accounts on AWS.

67
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,380
We might have some other cloud vendors.

68
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,110
And what we really wanna be
able to understand is the what.

69
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,030
What is the money going towards, right?

70
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,160
You come from an on-premise background

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,190
where everything is pretty
much taken care of, right?

72
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,233
You have a CapEx spent for five years.

73
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,620
Engineers will request some amount of CPU

74
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,070
and memory for their
Kubernetes nodes, their VMs.

75
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,410
And that was all there was to it.

76
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,200
And 1.0 was about, well, how
can we now aggregate this data

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,290
across four different
accounts for one team?

78
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,780
Or how do we now look at
something that happened

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,880
without the bill at the
end of the month, right?

80
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
So we had a lot of dashboards,
we had a lot of reports.

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,330
And 2.0 to me was, the next
question would be asked

82
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,850
is like, okay, I can see my bill,

83
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,470
but now what do we do about it?

84
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,370
Can we optimize?

85
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,740
Can we now get alerts faster?

86
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,380
Can we have budgets that
are actually reasonable

87
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,020
and not go out of style
or out of date every month

88
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,060
when we launch a new product?

89
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,510
And 2.0 had a lot of really
good, interesting things there

90
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,310
around optimization, especially.

91
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,803
We started thinking about
things like Kubernetes.

92
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,920
Can we optimize at the workload level?

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,110
Can we think about networks?

94
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,590
Can we think about intelligent
tiering on S3, for example?

95
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,010
But oftentimes in 2.0, what I
found was that even at Citi,

96
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,020
we would see a list of recommendations

97
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,540
that were say, 17 pages long.

98
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,850
And oftentimes I'd go to the
engineering team and say,

99
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,040
well, you should do these three things.

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
And they would either reply with,

101
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,500
well, we can't prioritize this,

102
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,940
we're trying to build a business.

103
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,490
Or this thing actually
doesn't apply to us.

104
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,040
Around anomaly detection, we
would get an alert that says,

105
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,470
hey, you spent $1,000 more than yesterday.

106
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,200
An engineer would just
right-click in Outlook,

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,270
make a new folder they would
never look at afterward

108
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,790
because they realize, well,
this is not a negative thing,

109
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,200
we just launched a production.

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,260
So oftentimes we're
lacking a lot of context.

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,495
And the lack of context
really makes it that

112
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:14,220
we're looking at one part of the whole,

113
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,460
which is the cloud cost, and
not necessarily architecture,

114
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,000
the business outcomes we care about,

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,750
or anything that actually
moves the needle there.

116
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,210
So 3.0 for me is all about confidence.

117
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,020
We go away from this place where,

118
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,220
you talk to FinOps, to any CXO,

119
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,410
and they think about the invoice
that they get every month

120
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,600
and the bill that keeps
creeping up and up and up.

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,670
And the engineers think about, well,

122
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,280
I guess I'm supposed to care
not only about security,

123
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,040
resiliency, availability,
but now my manager

124
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,380
really wants me to care about cost, great.

125
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,940
And we get into a place where

126
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,900
the tools that they're getting

127
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,540
and the data they're getting
is not only full of context,

128
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,460
but it's actually meaningful, right?

129
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,280
Especially when it comes
towards optimizations,

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,570
when it comes towards guardrails,

131
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,720
when it comes towards data
that's relevant there.

132
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,640
So within 3.0,

133
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,650
there's three key pillars
that I think about.

134
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,170
There's data, there's efficiency,

135
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,670
and then there's governance.

136
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,680
And data is probably
the place where we have

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,300
done the most amount of work, right?

138
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,550
We now have reports, we got, like I said,

139
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,930
a lot of dashboards.

140
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,640
Some people are doing
economics really well,

141
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,190
some are still struggling with that.

142
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,170
And we have efficiency,

143
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,660
we have some level of
optimization insights.

144
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,610
And governance, we have
a little bit, right?

145
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,710
We get anomaly alerts once in a while.

146
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,690
But to be able to
transform in the age of AI

147
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,690
where even if you
thought cloud was before,

148
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,540
was a little bit chaotic
compared to on-prem,

149
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,820
with AI, especially
energetic AI on the rise

150
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,980
and any sort of chatbots or any

151
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,720
gen AI workloads you're doing

152
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,910
it becomes critical to
move forward in FinOps

153
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,650
where instead of being in a place

154
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,210
where it's very reactionary, right?

155
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,670
The milk is spilt,
let's take a look at it.

156
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,440
Let's try to solve it
and all the engineers

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,560
are focused on optimization
for say a week or a month.

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
And then eventually it
starts creeping back up again

159
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,160
until someone freaks out about it.

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,720
Instead of fixing it that way,

161
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,310
I think we have to move forward in a place

162
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,430
where the context is loaded in the heart

163
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,960
of all three of these pillars.

164
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,270
So what I'll do now is double
click into each of these

165
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,833
and explain what I mean.

166
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,140
So on the data side, I think we have

167
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,080
the most amount of work done
already in FinOps, right?

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,880
From 1.0 to 2.0, we've got,

169
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,890
we already have level of economics,

170
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,990
we already have some sort of anomalies,

171
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,940
we already have reports we can get.

172
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,100
But the problem still is there where

173
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,810
if someone wants data, right?

174
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,980
Say your CEO wants to now
negotiate the new PPA deal.

175
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,920
They will still go to the CTO
who goes to the IT director

176
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,840
who goes to the FinOps head

177
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,520
and who eventually goes
to the FinOps engineer

178
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,490
who will extract some
data, put into Excel,

179
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,220
put into a PowerPoint,
goes back up the stack,

180
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,387
and the CEO may ask, "Well,
what about this gen AI thing?

181
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:47,640
"Can we load that in?"

182
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,870
This whole game of telephone repeats

183
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,490
itself again and again.

184
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,800
The other thing that
we have today is that,

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,650
sure, you can see the cost in
very granular fashion, right?

186
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,500
Even at Kubernetes level, we solved it

187
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,977
because now we can say, "Well,
we can allocate the cost

188
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:02,580
"by namespace, for example, as a proxy."

189
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,430
We have tagging strategies that
are pretty well thought out

190
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,320
and we can bifurcate
costs that's, you know,

191
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,540
say egress or data transfer

192
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,493
by doing things like cost follow cost.

193
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:14,280
What we're still missing
to me is this key concept

194
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,220
which is contextualizing the data, right?

195
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,570
Instead of just thinking about data

196
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,850
from a perspective of the cost itself,

197
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,290
what we're still missing is the context

198
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,420
around the business outcome
we really cared about.

199
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,010
It might be that when you launch

200
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,570
a new product to production

201
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,730
of course the cost is
going to go up, right?

202
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,430
But without having the
context and knowing up front,

203
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,570
you're still gonna get an anomaly

204
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,550
that is irrelevant to you.

205
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,840
Or it might be that, you know,

206
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,810
we're getting a lot of
different data reports.

207
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,120
However, what are we
actually doing with them

208
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,040
is still happening outside, right?

209
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,780
A product person may get a data set

210
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,300
that says the unit price for, you know,

211
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,250
daily active users is this much,

212
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,667
but they still have to then think about,

213
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,917
"Well, how do I now use this
data in my decision tree

214
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,067
"to think about, well, how
do I price my B2B app better?

215
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,190
"How do I think about margin production?"

216
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,370
And if you're on the, you
know, in an FSI, for example,

217
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,890
you're thinking about revenue
for the quant libraries

218
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,080
that you're running every
day for risk analysis,

219
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,060
but not knowing what are you actually

220
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,100
getting back in return, either
the number of calculations

221
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,680
or whether this upgrade that we did

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,800
that was, you know, benign and a refactor

223
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,080
is actually causing our
things to spike a lot more.

224
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,060
If you don't do these things properly,

225
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,270
it still becomes one of
those things that, you know,

226
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,280
cost data is still seen as a number

227
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,050
that we always have to tamp down,

228
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,427
rather than thinking about
it from a perspective of,

229
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,437
"Well, the cost is going up,

230
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:35,370
"but look at how much more
we're getting back in return."

231
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,980
So for me, there's really
three keys of focus here.

232
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,100
The first one is around what matters most

233
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,780
for performance and value, or rather,

234
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,450
for connecting the cloud spend
towards business outcomes.

235
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,970
And we had started this in FinOps 2.0

236
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,580
when we started thinking
about, say, uneconomics, right?

237
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,430
But we still are very short
of where we need to be,

238
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,400
which is, what are we getting
back in return, right?

239
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,410
Instead of thinking about
Gen AI, for example,

240
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,600
you open up a chatbot internally,

241
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,450
and it just connects
to, say, some MCP server

242
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,300
that does, you know, vacation days.

243
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,790
And what you don't realize
upfront is that every engineer

244
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,090
or everyone in your company
is going to love this chatbot.

245
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,220
And whatever you had thought about before

246
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,170
of daily active users
or the number of tokens

247
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,300
you'd be using, it kind
of goes out the window

248
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,430
when it's so variable there.

249
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,530
Rather than relying on only on, say,

250
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,560
a cloud cost being this absolute number

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,760
that should go up and down every month,

252
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,740
we really have to start thinking about,

253
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,080
well, what are we getting
back in return there, right?

254
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,460
Maybe the cost has to go up

255
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,160
because this new product
that we're launching

256
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,020
is very expensive, but the ROI on it

257
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,730
might not even be revenue.

258
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,110
It might be that our daily active users

259
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,130
is increasing tenfold, and
then we can serve them ads.

260
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,010
The second place I
think cloud cost, right,

261
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,900
visibility needs to improve,

262
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,330
would be around the
way we explain the why.

263
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,000
So today we do a really good
job of explaining the what.

264
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,300
We can take a million dollars
a month cloud cost from AWS,

265
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,760
we can bifurcate it
between every product team,

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,520
we can even go between
environments to say,

267
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,220
sandbox costs this much,
non-prod is that much,

268
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,960
and production is blah.

269
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,130
But we still can't answer

270
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,200
the why did the cost go up, right?

271
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
At the end of the day,
the cloud cost to me

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,340
is just another point
in your decision tree

273
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,930
when you're making better decisions.

274
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,930
It might be that you wanna
do optimizations today

275
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,280
because you realize that every time

276
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,590
we're doing a PR on Terraform,

277
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,470
the cloud unit price for
our million API calls

278
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,820
is increasing tenfold.

279
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,060
There has to be something
else we can do there.

280
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,070
'Cause if you don't do that,
especially with Gen AI,

281
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,390
and if you don't do it now,

282
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,150
it's gonna get very difficult
where all of a sudden,

283
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,710
every time you use a different model,

284
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,870
or you have a context
that's being changed,

285
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,410
or the embeddings itself is
not being utilized properly,

286
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,300
this variable cloud
cost that we have today

287
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,730
is only gonna increase in variability,

288
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,740
and it's just gonna cause
a lot of heartburn, right?

289
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,540
Every single person will just think,

290
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,060
this number, it will never go down

291
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,050
until someone freaks out about it,

292
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,000
and then we have to have this whole

293
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,420
two, three week cycle where
we put all our heads down,

294
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,820
figure out the unattached EBS volumes,

295
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,460
or hey, this bucket
that's just holding logs

296
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,890
should not even be in standards,
should be in whatever.

297
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,960
But instead, we get into
this continuous cycle

298
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,183
where we're getting the data when we need.

299
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,610
And the last part for me would be around

300
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,230
delivering the right
data to the right person

301
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,130
at the right time.

302
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,050
So oftentimes I feel like,
as a former engineer,

303
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,670
still engineer a little bit,

304
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,230
I find this trope in FinOps

305
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,750
that engineers don't
care about cloud cost.

306
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,490
And to me, it's always been really funny.

307
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,440
It's not that we don't care about it,

308
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,380
it's more that if you think
about every single other

309
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,840
metric that we quote unquote care about,

310
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,250
be it throughput, performance,
reliability, availability,

311
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,380
we have the tools to help us get there,

312
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,760
and it's quantifiable.

313
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,890
You can tell when you have
100 transactions a second,

314
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,540
you can tell when you can support

315
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,060
100 active daily users, or a million,

316
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,830
and you can tell when security itself is,

317
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,320
it's embedded in the
lifecycle of development.

318
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,880
But with cloud cost, we still
look at it as something that

319
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,610
we're supposed to care about,

320
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,700
and yet we don't really
offer the proper tooling.

321
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,020
We don't tell engineers that, hey,

322
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,450
this simple web server that you're running

323
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,720
could run on Lambda, it
could run on ECS, EKS,

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
Fargate, whatever, and
yet here's a trade-off

325
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,490
between all three of them.

326
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,240
It's one of those things that,
if you don't do it properly,

327
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,760
it just becomes a thing that
you always do afterward,

328
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,470
and by then, sometimes
it's either too late,

329
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,350
or it just causes burnout,
where an engineer says,

330
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,270
yeah, I'd love to care
about cloud cost, too,

331
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,560
but can you give me the right tooling

332
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,060
that isn't just a report that says

333
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm spending too much money?

334
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,650
If you don't go beyond that,
it's gonna get very difficult

335
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,540
to kind of give the
engineers the right tooling

336
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,470
in the lifecycle that
they actually have to say,

337
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,820
well, what is the scenario
that you're describing of

338
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,730
this Gen AI product that you wanna launch,

339
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,160
which everyone is super excited about?

340
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,010
If you use this model
based on the test data,

341
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,590
it's gonna cost this much every
single time person hits it,

342
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,720
and based on historical evidence,

343
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,250
in our production environment,

344
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,260
this is the number of
users we're expecting.

345
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,690
If you use this other
model, it might be cheaper,

346
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,800
or it might be more expensive,

347
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,170
but this is the value you
get back in return there.

348
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,120
And so being able to do these
three things really well,

349
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,230
being able to connect to an

350
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,180
actual outcome from the business

351
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,640
and not necessarily on just a raw number

352
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,470
that you're trying to raise or lower,

353
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,580
being able to explain the why,

354
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,800
and not necessarily just the what,

355
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,230
and then finally being able
to deliver the right insights,

356
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,140
I think can really be powered
by Gen AI now as well.

357
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,390
Imagine a world where, in my CEO example,

358
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,060
instead of him or her
going towards the CTO,

359
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,790
to the director, to the
FinOps, to the FinOps engineer,

360
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,320
they can just ask in English,

361
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,330
where is most of my spend going?

362
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,950
When I renew my PPA,

363
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,000
what are the SKUs I should try

364
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,710
to actually get a discount on?

365
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,620
Or for an engineer, a
what-if analysis that,

366
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,920
sure, we wanna launch and
migrate from VMs to containers,

367
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,360
what is the cost going to be if

368
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,040
I just did a lift and shift?

369
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,630
What if I actually just use Fargate?

370
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,520
Or what if I wanted to do EKS itself?

371
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,320
And what would that look like there?

372
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,060
The second pillar for
me is around efficiency.

373
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,670
And I think this is where
we've spent a lot of time

374
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,520
in the last five or six years in FinOps.

375
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,290
It's all about optimization.

376
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,470
And traditionally, the
FinOps optimization story

377
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,480
goes something along what
I call the FinOops moment,

378
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,570
where the bill is running
and all of a sudden,

379
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,030
you see a giant spike that's unexplained

380
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,710
and everyone freaks out about it.

381
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,270
And we start looking and we start,

382
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,290
it's almost like a duck hunt,

383
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,420
where you find a million dollars here,

384
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,430
we find $20,000 there.

385
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,110
And a lot of these
tools that are out there

386
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,340
will help you with this.

387
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,810
They'll be able to analyze your cost

388
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,047
and be able to tell you,

389
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:33,997
"Hey, you should consolidate
your VPC endpoints.

390
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:37,597
"You should look at lowering
the utilization on your VM,

391
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:39,877
"or rather, fixing the VM size

392
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,030
"so you can match the utilization."

393
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,110
But what I find often, though,

394
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,440
is a lot of these optimization
recommendations fall short

395
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,600
because they don't
understand your architecture.

396
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,570
It might be that the VPC
endpoint consolidation,

397
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,790
when you go to the team
that's doing networking,

398
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,047
might say, "Well, the way
we deployed our network

399
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,507
"in every single account,
it'll take nine months to do,

400
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,600
"to save 1%."

401
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,930
We don't really fully understand the cost

402
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,270
of actually doing some of these actions

403
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,150
in a way that actually gives
confidence to the teams

404
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,680
that are supposed to
be taking these actions

405
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,350
in a way that they'll actually apply them.

406
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,517
It might be that the recommendation says,

407
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:18,210
"Switch to ARM processors,
it's way cheaper,"

408
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,460
but your quant libraries only run on x86.

409
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,370
So you can look at it,
you can feel bad about it,

410
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,020
you can ignore it, but oftentimes,

411
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,030
as soon as you start
ignoring these things,

412
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,537
you start losing value and realizing,

413
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:30,997
"Well, the analysis is not really done.

414
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,827
"The report card that I get from FinOps

415
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:35,227
"says I have a C-minus on my team,

416
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,297
"and my product head is
really upset about it,

417
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:39,960
"but I can't really do any
of these things anyway."

418
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,180
So being able to focus
on the what matters most

419
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,860
for performance and value,

420
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,170
and understanding the context
of what's actually happening

421
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,020
in your architecture
becomes really important.

422
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,750
It might be that when you start
looking at models in GenAI,

423
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,207
and you say, "Well, why
are we using SONET 4.5?

424
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,117
"We don't need to use this.

425
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:56,407
"We should be using a quantized version

426
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,860
"because that's what this
recommendation says."

427
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,367
And you realize, "Well, the thing

428
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,630
"that we're actually using
it for requires this model."

429
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,510
Or if every engineer starts loading

430
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,500
their full context window
because it's two million,

431
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,370
it's amazing, and the
answers you're getting back

432
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,260
are now running up the bill,

433
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,527
instead of looking at that and saying,

434
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:16,500
"Well, shorten the context window,"

435
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,370
if you don't understand,

436
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,810
well, you don't have an embeddings model

437
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,980
in the middle of it,

438
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,820
and 85% of your stuff is the
most generic MCP answers,

439
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,920
it's really difficult
to now have engineers

440
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,080
start to think about these things

441
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,893
in a way that moves the needle.

442
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,310
Being able to prioritize these decisions

443
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,530
in a way that isn't left to someone

444
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,890
to look at these 17 pages of
optimizations and figure out,

445
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,020
yeah, I guess I will do this one,

446
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,970
it'll go in the backlog of a team

447
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,620
until someone freaks out about it,

448
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,830
and instead, being able to
now meet them where they are.

449
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,110
When someone is doing
an actual architecture

450
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,420
and they're doing performance
testing and non-prod,

451
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,090
being able to have the cost
data right there that says,

452
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,700
yes, you got your performance
that you really cared about,

453
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,080
but at what cost?

454
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,430
And there's two different alternatives

455
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,620
that you could actually
do for similar performance

456
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,330
for a fraction of the cost.

457
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,660
Or conversely, when you
see an optimization,

458
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,000
instead of thinking about
only the actual thing

459
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,890
that you have to do, be it Terraform,

460
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,540
CloudFormation, whatever,

461
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,250
but really understanding
your full architecture

462
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,230
that the way you've set up your accounts,

463
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,060
the way you have set up your organization,

464
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,700
it's gonna be very difficult
to do this in a timely manner,

465
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,930
and you'll have to do a lot more testing

466
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,090
in order to actually do this.

467
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,490
That's what's missing today.

468
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,130
And finally, I think on
the optimization side,

469
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,660
I know Joe's here from FinOps.

470
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,490
We always talk about shift left, right?

471
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,260
Everything should be shifting left.

472
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,460
All the engineers should be the ones

473
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,450
who think about these things,

474
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,180
and product teams should
think about cloud cost

475
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,660
as a first and foremost,

476
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,390
but I think sometimes there's
a lot of different examples

477
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,490
where shift left doesn't really apply,

478
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,200
and we should be able to
automate these things.

479
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,990
An example of that is
in Kubernetes, right?

480
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,670
Each workload, you went from a VM

481
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,850
that was, say, 20 gigs with four vCPUs,

482
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,990
and you go to containers,

483
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,137
and your engineers will say,

484
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,657
"Well, I need 20 gigs and four vCPUs too.

485
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,450
"That made sense before."

486
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,250
And you get this
utilization number that says

487
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,940
you're using 10% of
your node in Kubernetes.

488
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,773
And all of a sudden,

489
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:08,257
you now have engineers
trying to figure out,

490
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:10,147
"Well, I guess I need 10 gigs.

491
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,840
"I think I need 3.2 CPUs."

492
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,430
And you do this entire performance test

493
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,010
to figure out, and you isolate the cost.

494
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,230
But then as soon as you
pull out another PR,

495
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,270
or you start making more
calls to the database,

496
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,880
or there's a refactor that was benign,

497
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,950
the number might go way down or way up.

498
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,390
And so oftentimes, I feel like,

499
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,950
especially in Kubernetes,

500
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,510
it doesn't make sense to have engineers

501
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,270
always be shifting left and
worrying about these things.

502
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,100
We should be able to automate them.

503
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,700
We shouldn't necessarily have to have

504
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,120
every single engineer
care about these things

505
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,730
to the level where they feel obligated

506
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,560
to now not only do security,

507
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,140
not only do observability, reliability,

508
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,127
on and on and on, and then also think,

509
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,887
"Well, what are these dials
should be set to exactly

510
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,850
"to get performance at the cost as well?"

511
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,960
We should be able to automate these things

512
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,810
when they happen.

513
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,610
On the governance side,

514
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,510
I think this is where GenAI
will be really helpful

515
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,190
and will be really needed.

516
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,320
Governance up till now has been around,

517
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,830
specifically cost governance,

518
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,230
it's really been around
anomaly detections.

519
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,850
When the cost exceeds a number or a budget

520
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,880
is breached by a certain
amount, alert somebody.

521
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,370
That's pretty much what we do today.

522
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,720
And I find that really challenging

523
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,710
because oftentimes when you
look at that in isolation,

524
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,600
you get the alert, it fires off,

525
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,820
it might go to PagerDuty,
it might go to the SRE team,

526
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,700
maybe the engineers, maybe
it opens a backlog ticket

527
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,190
in your Jira board that says, "Fix this."

528
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,750
And when you go to take a look at it,

529
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,730
there's a lot of legwork to be done.

530
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,350
You have to understand, "Well,

531
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,797
why did this actually happen?

532
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,080
"Was this a good thing?"

533
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,780
Maybe you spend 24 hours
looking at an anomaly

534
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,767
and realize, "Well, we were
in the front of a tech crunch,

535
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,237
"and this is not a bad thing at all.

536
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,257
"The cost should be going up

537
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,770
"because we're scaling automatically."

538
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,600
Maybe you had a great
quarter and all of a sudden

539
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,760
you're doing a lot of quant calculations

540
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,470
because you're making a lot of revenue.

541
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,240
Well, of course the cost is gonna go up,

542
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,520
but without that context
of why it's happening

543
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,950
is really difficult, and
oftentimes what I've found

544
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,170
is that engineers will get this alert,

545
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,390
might be product or might be whoever,

546
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,060
and as soon as they see,
"Well, this was a false alarm,"

547
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,850
even if the limits are set
to say reasonable numbers,

548
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,760
like only if the cost goes
up $100,000, alert me.

549
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,770
If it was a good thing
and not a bad thing,

550
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,150
you're gonna start ignoring it.

551
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,980
And oftentimes when you
start ignoring these things

552
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,240
is when the real problems arise

553
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,490
because you kinda ignore the
actual issue when it happens

554
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,490
because every single
time you've taken a look,

555
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,430
it just feels like it's
another thing to ignore.

556
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,320
So being able to fix these things,

557
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,870
to me, comes down to this.

558
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,700
It's very similar to security in a way.

559
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,920
You wanna prevent the
bad things from happening

560
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,180
first and foremost.

561
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,230
In FinOps, it might be
that you wanna prevent

562
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,640
in your ephemeral environments

563
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,740
anything but spot instances.

564
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,530
It might be that the Gen
AI team is the only one

565
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,270
that should use the P5
clusters in Kubernetes

566
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,750
'cause it's $95 an hour or whatever,

567
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,970
and you don't want anyone
else to touch them.

568
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,030
Or it might be on and on,
all these different rules

569
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,010
that you wanna set in place that are,

570
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,050
at the same time, not too restrictive

571
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,120
where you're blocking
innovation in your teams,

572
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,487
but also not so brittle
that every single time

573
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,550
you set a policy in place,
an engineer comes to you

574
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,770
and everything's an
exception all the time.

575
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,690
Eventually, if you start doing that,

576
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,120
the teams will basically
just raise an exception

577
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,680
for everything they wanna do,

578
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,830
and this entire prevention
system that we've built

579
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,303
kinda goes out the window.

580
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,830
The second step is, if
you find you can prevent

581
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,260
a lot of these things from happening,

582
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,093
they'll still happen.

583
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,470
There'll still be rules that were slipped

584
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,410
or someone went in console
in your non-prod environment,

585
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,350
did one small thing
that now raised the bar,

586
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,970
or raised the price, rather.

587
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,990
And when those things happen,

588
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,120
you wanna detect them as soon as possible.

589
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,710
And you wanna detect them not at the level

590
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,990
of just only cost, which we're used to,

591
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,150
but you wanna detect the
underlying reason for it.

592
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,240
It might be that the thing
that someone was trying,

593
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,490
they forgot to quote-unquote
shut off the lights.

594
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,460
It was a experiment they
were running on inference

595
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,560
or training a model, and afterward,

596
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,990
they forgot to right-size
the cluster right after.

597
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,430
It might be they're
doing performance testing

598
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,550
and 24 hours later, the
performance test is done,

599
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,900
but six months later, as you discover,

600
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,050
this cluster's still running there.

601
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:19,050
Or as a personal example,
once I had a call

602
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,637
from AWS partners where they said,

603
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:23,830
"This account that runs only $400 a month

604
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,150
"is up to $180,000 in 24 hours."

605
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,357
And we started looking, and we're like,

606
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:29,610
"Oh God, what happened?"

607
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,230
The oops moment.

608
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,850
And it turns out someone was trying

609
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,830
to do exponential back-off on queues,

610
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,570
and they were using serverless, Lambdas,

611
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,770
and so it should be really cheap,

612
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,030
except they didn't really implement

613
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,280
the exponential part properly.

614
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
So we're retrying the same failed message

615
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,720
600 times a second for 24 hours.

616
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,657
And all of a sudden, you realize,

617
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,117
"Well, why did we not know
about this immediately?

618
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,447
"Why did we have to wait
until either getting a call

619
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,057
"or an anomaly seven or eight hours later?

620
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,157
"And oftentimes, when
you get this anomaly,

621
00:22:57,157 --> 00:22:58,807
"why was it not told me immediately

622
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:00,240
"what was the cause of it?"

623
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,840
And today, we get the cause
in terms of this service

624
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,880
is the one that's spending a lot of money,

625
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,260
but what we don't get is a context

626
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,290
of this PR that was raised that

627
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,610
was being done by this team,

628
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,100
and this is what the
code snippet was doing.

629
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,800
This change is causing
this to happen, right?

630
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,630
So being able to fully embed the context

631
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,160
of what we're describing here,

632
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,240
I think we'll do two things.

633
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,080
One, we'll get away
from this idea of wolf,

634
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,610
the boy who cried wolf all the time,

635
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,710
of random anomaly alerts that you ignore,

636
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,820
budgets that are out of date.

637
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,207
So you say, "No, it's fine.

638
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:33,667
"We had a meeting last month
that we updated the budget,

639
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,090
"but we forgot to tell
the FinOps team about it."

640
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,010
But instead, you get into a place where,

641
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,180
especially with AI agents,

642
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,670
where you can actually look at an anomaly,

643
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,320
and by the time it hits your desk,

644
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,630
you're getting the full
context of why it happened,

645
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,840
what's happening, and then
finally, how to remediate it.

646
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,760
And today, remediation
is one of those things

647
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,890
that we don't really offer, right?

648
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,917
We say, "Hey, there's an issue.

649
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,340
"Go take a look at it, figure it out."

650
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,330
And oftentimes, there's
a lot of time spent

651
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,030
trying to figure this out, right?

652
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,400
Either be it, is it a code change?

653
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,750
Was it that we had a lot more volume,

654
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,670
and it was a good thing,
like I said earlier?

655
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,270
Was it something else
causing this entirely?

656
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,540
Could it have been that
the savings plan ran out,

657
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,370
and so now the cost is spiking,

658
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,267
and that is a reason for it,

659
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:14,850
and not that EC2 is all
of a sudden 40% higher

660
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,250
than it was last month, right?

661
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,250
So being able to now
remediate it in a way that,

662
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,560
in fact, why even stop there?

663
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,300
Instead of just showing you what it is

664
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,270
that you should fix, oftentimes,
I feel like in security,

665
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,890
we would be able to patch
something immediately.

666
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,410
We give access to a lot
of our security tools

667
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,410
that if they detect a
vulnerability, fix it on the spot.

668
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,010
And now, in my mind, FinOps
is one of those things

669
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,710
that doesn't have to be all the way there,

670
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,390
but it can be a lot closer to it.

671
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,370
For example, in remediation,

672
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,980
when you have a issue that happens,

673
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,080
and it was caused by a
code change in Terraform

674
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,850
or in application logic,

675
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,010
why can't we just raise
the PR automatically?

676
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,500
And we still rely on the engineer

677
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,100
to actually approve the PR,
test it, and then merge it in,

678
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,660
but at least get them all the way there,

679
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,700
or at least give them the logging

680
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,760
from CloudWatch and CloudTrail,
VPC flow logs, maybe,

681
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,890
of this is the cause,
this is what we think,

682
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,870
and we did research for you already.

683
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,310
And maybe in some environments,

684
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,850
like, say, your non-prod or
experimental environment,

685
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,640
why don't we fix these
things automatically?

686
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,580
The example I used earlier
of shutting down the lights.

687
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,580
Experiment is over, the model looks great,

688
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,080
we're gonna go to production with it.

689
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,670
We don't need to rely on every engineer

690
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,830
to remember to now spin down that instance

691
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,870
or in the performance environment.

692
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,670
We should be able to do it automatically

693
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,623
within rules that actually make sense.

694
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,620
And the way we make these rules, right,

695
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,280
of the prevention, the
detection, and the remediation

696
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,680
should follow a security model as well.

697
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,230
Instead of having very brittle policies

698
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,320
that always are out of date,
which are full of exceptions,

699
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,420
which aren't catching
the new things anyway,

700
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,530
we should be in a place where

701
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,810
they're all continuously learning as well.

702
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,280
We should be in a place where

703
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,560
an engine or a centralized FinOps team

704
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,720
can put very basic
rules in place initially

705
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,090
for some environments, and
the higher environments

706
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,450
really lock them down to prevent

707
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,270
these things from occurring.

708
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,100
And then when there's an exception,

709
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,110
automatically apply it in a way that

710
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,220
isn't an exception anymore,

711
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,870
but now becomes a standard there.

712
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,290
Now, assuming that what
I just described to you

713
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,960
of between the data side,
between the governance side

714
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,140
and efficiency side, let's
take an example here.

715
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,770
So assume that you run a B2B SaaS company,

716
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,080
you come to re:Invent, and it takes off.

717
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,060
Everyone comes to your
booth, they love it,

718
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,130
and they start using it properly.

719
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,530
Everyone's signing up
for it, it's amazing.

720
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,970
Tomorrow morning, you'll get a bill

721
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,430
that says your bill is up 1,000%.

722
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,560
Now, in FinOps 2.0 and
1.0, what would happen

723
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,140
is someone would get this
bill in your company,

724
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,760
absolutely freak out about it,

725
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,230
and now start going down the rabbit hole

726
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,520
of what's causing this.

727
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,160
They would see some
things that are spiking,

728
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,350
there's some resiliency
issues that are happening,

729
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,730
some things are scaling horizontally

730
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,010
in a way they didn't
intend, on and on and on,

731
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,410
and eventually, maybe the
product team would chime in

732
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,390
and say, oh no, that's expected.

733
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,640
We look at the amount
of daily users we have.

734
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,970
Eventually, the CTO or CFO
would also get involved

735
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,340
because the bill is so much
higher than they expected.

736
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,930
The procurement team
might freak out about it

737
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,360
because the PPA was for a lot less

738
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,350
than what they had intended.

739
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,180
They could have gotten a bigger discount.

740
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,040
In FinOps 3.0, the response would be

741
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,610
an agent that's running sees the spike,

742
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,500
understands that re:Invent's happening,

743
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,460
sees all these traffic coming
in from new user signups,

744
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,120
and people are actually
trying the application out

745
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,420
immediately, and then understand,

746
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,130
well, the unit price per daily active user

747
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,300
is actually going down.

748
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,070
We're actually scaling
really, really efficiently,

749
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,380
and this baseline cost that we had,

750
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,610
this is a really good thing.

751
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,020
So there should not be an alert fired.

752
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,900
In fact, maybe there's
a report that's sent out

753
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,140
that says, hey, this is
something that has now occurred,

754
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,000
but this is the context of it.

755
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,670
The CEO gets it, the product team gets it.

756
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,170
Maybe the engineering team gets a report

757
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,170
that shows them, at
scale, these two services

758
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,760
are the ones you should try to optimize,

759
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,250
and here's a PR that actually
helps you optimize them.

760
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,530
So when you start scaling horizontally,

761
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,450
it isn't this giant spike going forward.

762
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,680
Maybe there's an architectural review

763
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,350
that you can do on the
fly to change things.

764
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,760
Try it out in non-prod with the volume

765
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,290
that you're looking at, and then apply it

766
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,733
within a couple of hours.

767
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,040
And the outcome really would be here

768
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,980
that instead of always
thinking about the what

769
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,160
and this feeling of the
number is always going up,

770
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,140
the cloud cost is too high.

771
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,190
We're freaking out about it.

772
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,170
You should be in a place where cloud cost

773
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,750
is in context of all these
other things you care about.

774
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,270
So regardless of whether
it goes up or down,

775
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,620
you understand the context of it,

776
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,420
which gives a lot of
confidence in being able

777
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,720
to not only save money,
but also spend more money.

778
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,880
The confidence to actually
get out of this POC

779
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,500
for all these good ideas you have

780
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,950
of using Gen AI workloads,
actually start moving them

781
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,440
to production, 'cause
you're no longer worried

782
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,480
about the fact that,
well, last time we did

783
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,710
a Gen AI project, we launched it.

784
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,660
It was a million dollars
more than we intended.

785
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,830
So let's slow down on it.

786
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,320
Instead, you have
confidence that the build

787
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,340
that you're expecting and the
data that you're looking at

788
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,080
is full of context of what
you're getting back in return.

789
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,720
You have the anomaly set up in a way that

790
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,970
you're only getting the
things that are actual issues,

791
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,910
like my serverless Lambda moment.

792
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,890
And you'll also be able
to build policies in place

793
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,010
that are not so brittle that
the team is spending time

794
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,240
just doing this nonstop.

795
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,313
Instead, they're self-healing in a way.

796
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,580
And to do everything I'm describing,

797
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,080
it's only really possible
today in my mind with Gen AI.

798
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,410
Being able to connect the
cost data, your business data,

799
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,720
performance data all
together in this Venn diagram

800
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,840
where you fully understand
what is actually happening,

801
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,730
before it would take a lot of effort.

802
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,110
It'd probably be in Excel.

803
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,070
You'd probably be trying to combine

804
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,860
different data sets together
and be very time in place.

805
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,530
You might do this once
a quarter, once a year,

806
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,420
or whenever the CEO
freaks out about the cost.

807
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,020
And instead, you should be
able to do this continuously.

808
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,400
You should be able to look at your data

809
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,810
in the fully loaded context I'm

810
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,060
describing in near real time.

811
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,100
You should be able to
understand that the cost data

812
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,300
that's spiking is a
good thing, like I said.

813
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,710
The other side is automating
the analysis, right?

814
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,960
So on the optimization side,

815
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,750
instead of just only
looking at in isolation,

816
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,390
we should do this, which
will result in lower cost,

817
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,740
we should be able to understand,

818
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,950
well, the cost of doing that
would require a full rewrite

819
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,440
and a replatforming of
our entire application.

820
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,700
That's gonna take 10 months.

821
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,080
We don't have to wait that long.

822
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,910
Can we do something today?

823
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,540
Sure, that thing may
save 9% year over year,

824
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,953
but at what cost?

825
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,140
Will the engineering teams
drop everything they're doing

826
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,410
to focus on this one
thing versus something

827
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,860
that could be a very minor change today

828
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,630
that can start saving
you money immediately?

829
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,300
And finally, being able
to learn from this context

830
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,400
in a way that you can
actually guide the prevention,

831
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,490
the detection, the
remediation automatically

832
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,460
to help shift not so much left anymore,

833
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,610
but back to the center where
it actually makes sense.

834
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,800
Instead of having
engineers being overloaded

835
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,323
to say now also worry about
the myriad of different things

836
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,150
that you have to do in cloud,

837
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,190
we can actually help them
and give them the right data

838
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,990
so they can make better decisions.

839
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,930
We should be able to have
our CEOs ask the question,

840
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,720
not in an email chain that
goes nine messages deep

841
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,000
before it hits a person
who's doing the work,

842
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,260
but maybe they can just ask in English

843
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,590
and your AI agent can
run in the background,

844
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,680
getting the relevant data,
doing the what-if analysis,

845
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,120
and giving the answer
that they actually need

846
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,420
in the right moment there.

847
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,960
So yeah, in summary, I think
this continuous learning

848
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,110
that we're describing of
FinOps going from the static

849
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,330
once-in-a-time thing that we try to do,

850
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,460
we get the flywheel effect going instead.

851
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,930
We start thinking about cloud costs

852
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,810
as a key point in a decision tree

853
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,360
when we're making architectural decisions,

854
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,010
business decisions, and product decisions

855
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,200
rather than something to look at

856
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,020
that has to always be
lowered or freak out about

857
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,550
because the number's too high.

858
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,500
We should be able to have
this done autonomously

859
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,660
in a way that we're not
asking our engineers

860
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,100
to spend so much time analyzing this data

861
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,000
that we have to build a
FinOps team to be 10 analysts

862
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,950
who are just continuously serving us

863
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,440
almost like an internal
consultancy of sorts.

864
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,390
Engineers come to your team,

865
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,490
the bill is too high,
help me figure it out,

866
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,060
and we do this process again and again.

867
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,790
Instead, we meet them where they are.

868
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,030
We connect with them, maybe
in their CI/CD pipeline.

869
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,590
Maybe we give them the right tooling

870
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,230
for the centralized team
to build these guardrails

871
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,510
and policies in place
that don't require you

872
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,450
to have a mathematics degree
to build out policies.

873
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,000
Maybe we are finally moving from a place

874
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,940
where we have these anomalies
that are lacking context

875
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,210
and go into the dustbin, so to speak,

876
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,780
but instead are full of information

877
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,620
and actually help you because
the only time they're raised

878
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,450
is when there's an actual issue there.

879
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,820
And then finally, going
from this cost data

880
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,370
in isolation towards this connected data

881
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,500
and being able to use that
to make better decisions

882
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,753
is finally where we
can get to with Gen AI.

883
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,010
So for me, going back to my city example,

884
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,437
it was never about cutting cost.

885
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,220
It was always about giving the confidence

886
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,230
to spend more money because I feel like

887
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,450
the true value of cloud
is that you're getting

888
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,180
just the right amount of
compute, storage, databases,

889
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
whatever, when you actually need it

890
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,010
and not this thing that where every time

891
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,380
you deploy something and
you take a look at it,

892
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,640
you're finding all these random issues

893
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,550
because every time you find these issues

894
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,910
of either unattached
EBS volumes or whatever,

895
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,160
you start to lose a
little bit of confidence.

896
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,630
You start to get into a place where

897
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,430
there's a little bit of hesitation

898
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,500
before we open up the floodgates

899
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,060
for this beautiful Gen
AI thing that you built

900
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,520
and yet you don't understand

901
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,620
why someone's not signing off on it.

902
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,180
You get into a place
where you have confidence

903
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,250
that not only are we gonna launch this,

904
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,320
we have confidence that if
there's something that happens,

905
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,890
we'll be able to find
out about it immediately

906
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,530
and we might be able to
fix it within an hour,

907
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,030
within two hours or something.

908
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,470
With that, I'll open up the
floor for any questions.

909
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,303
Thank you.
