1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
- I'm the GM of Contact
Center for Zendesk.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,337
It was interesting, Jay
Backstage was saying sort of,

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,160
"I know the brand Zendesk,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,740
I think I used it in
college in a side job.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,110
I didn't know that they did
anything in contact center,"

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,700
which is great, which is why I'm here,

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,550
and I'm delighted to tell you
about the business that I run.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,980
It was a result of an
acquisition earlier in the year

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,440
of my company, which was Local Measure.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,250
We've now built that platform
natively into Zendesk,

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,560
and that's what I'm gonna
talk a little bit about today.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,470
But actually, I'm not gonna
talk about myself first.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,730
We are gonna talk a little bit

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,060
about what we think the future
of contact center looks like.

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,280
I'm out with customers every day,

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,220
and we also spoke to
about a thousand customers

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,010
to synthesize some of their worries.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,200
Some of them cried in the
corner when they spoke

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,450
to us about the future of contact center,

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,360
and we synthesize it down to five trends

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
and things that you might
want to think about.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,500
This was a quote from one of our customers

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,870
who runs a healthcare business,

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,210
which I think summed up the Zendesk view

25
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,680
of where things are going,

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
digital agents, human agents,

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,680
and all of these channels
working seamlessly together

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
to deliver a great customer experience.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,090
It sounds simple,

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,640
but I think probably like
all of you are feeling,

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,690
this technology change
is probably the fastest

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,610
that I've certainly
ever seen in my career.

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,650
I remember the dot-com boom,

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,290
I remember the social mobile trend

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,670
which was gonna take over the world,

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,010
and each of those technology trends

37
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,203
sort of impacted the way that we work.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,340
The impact, I think, on service from AI

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,470
is possibly the fastest.

40
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm fortunate to be in a
business within Zendesk

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,490
that we believe has the
biggest AI footprint

42
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,380
of any vendor globally

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,440
with 20,000 customers live in production

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,360
using our AI services.

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,950
Our CEO on Bloomberg yesterday

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,260
said that's a $200 million run rate.

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,810
So this isn't tech that's in the lab,

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,280
this isn't things that are
happening on POCs and trials.

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,590
This is in the real world,

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,640
impacting your customers, taking
cost out of your business.

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,570
I'm that excited.

52
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,300
I'm throwing the clicker around.

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,280
What some of these customers told us

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,780
is as service is getting
better, particularly on voice,

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,313
they're seeing more volume.

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,520
Nicholas and I have a bet,
who's in the audience,

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,130
I bet with him that in two years time,

58
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,460
20% of all of the service automation

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,870
that comes over voice,

60
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,900
all the service calls will be automated.

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,450
Our customers tell us 50%.

62
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,730
We are clearly not there yet on voice.

63
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,530
On digital channels, we have customers

64
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,890
seeing 50, 60, 70, 80% automation.

65
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,660
Voice has taken a little bit longer

66
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,030
because the quality
hasn't quite been there.

67
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,830
But it's really interesting
to see our customers

68
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,590
are telling us kind of they believe

69
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,630
over the next two to three years

70
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,210
50% will be fully automated,

71
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,860
and there's a mandate from the board

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,130
and there's pressure coming down to AI,

73
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,450
as one customer told me,

74
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,850
and I asked them, "What does AI mean?"

75
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,550
And they said, "Well, the
board told us to add AI."

76
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,190
So I think some of the metrics and the,

77
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,860
and the reasons are still
sort of being unpacked.

78
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,050
For us, it's all about
driving a resolution,

79
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,550
driving an outcome

80
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,890
for the customers that delivers value.

81
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,160
We're sort of maniacally
focused on resolution

82
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,100
as the unit of measurement
to make sure that,

83
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,400
you know, customers are
having their issues resolved

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,620
and we're actually even charging customers

85
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,600
for our own services based on resolution

86
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,330
because we believe that, like,
when you deliver an outcome

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,290
for a customer,

88
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,263
that delivers the most
value back to the business.

89
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,650
I think one thing that is abundantly clear

90
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,960
is sort of the old model
of running a contact center

91
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
is slowly dying,

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,010
and we have to reimagine
the ways of working,

93
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,640
we have to reimagine the way
we staff contact centers,

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,650
we have to reimagine
the ways that we show up

95
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,750
for customers and the channels.

96
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,843
One I think big inhibitor that we saw,

97
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,510
particularly for voice and voice AI,

98
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,670
was that customers felt

99
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,070
that the quality hasn't
historically been there

100
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,560
with chatbots and AI interactions.

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,130
I mean we've all had
experiences of talking to a bot

102
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,240
that hasn't understood us

103
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,853
and going around and
around in endless loops.

104
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,420
You know, one of my solutions consultants

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,910
said to me, and my Australian accent,

106
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,480
Australians use 30
different variants for yes,

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,990
and that's ya and yis,

108
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,910
and I think if you don't program that

109
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,820
in many of the bots the right way,

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,950
you sort of have a bot that
doesn't understand you,

111
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,620
and it becomes an incredibly
frustrating experience

112
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,970
with these deterministic bots.

113
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,850
What's really cool with
a new version of AI bots

114
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,160
is that they can understand
the kind of context

115
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,300
and route you the right way,

116
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,370
and therefore what
customers are telling us

117
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,960
is they're finally comfortable

118
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,760
with the level of quality on AI,

119
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,250
and we're seeing now
finally a mass adoption

120
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,723
in the contact center space.

121
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,960
So without further ado,
we tried to summarize

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,840
what was a thousand different perspectives

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
from contact center leaders.

124
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,710
I mean, you ask one contact center leader

125
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,900
for one opinion and they give you five.

126
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,020
We try to bring it together
into sort of five core themes,

127
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,030
which also align, I think, very nicely

128
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,830
to what Zendesk thinks is happening

129
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,780
in voice and around the contact center.

130
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,080
The first kind of conviction we have

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
is that all interactions
in the contact center

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,310
are gonna begin with AI.

133
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,080
The idea of routing,

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,830
the idea of IVRs is sort
of a legacy concept,

135
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,100
and essentially the AI
becomes the concierge

136
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,070
and the front door for your organization.

137
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,000
And so what that means is
then we need to sort of skill

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,740
our contact centers in a different way.

139
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,630
Those level 100, level 200 agents

140
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,620
become the AI,

141
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,800
and we shift the human agents
to level 300 and level 400,

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,900
the more complex tasks.

143
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,210
The challenge we have in assessing the ROI

144
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,070
is all of our metrics
are currently broken,

145
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,960
which we'll get to in a moment.

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,440
Our CTO joked yesterday,
"I mean, what is the use

147
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,040
of an average speed to
answer when, you know,

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,830
an AI can answer in 100
or 200 milliseconds?"

149
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,480
So we have to reimagine

150
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
what we're tracking
and why we're tracking.

151
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,470
But our house view

152
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,560
is that there'll be no
press one for sales,

153
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,730
press two for support,

154
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,860
or shouting agent into the phone.

155
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,290
Like, the AI will start,

156
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,150
will understand the context,

157
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,030
will self-serve and execute
procedures where it can,

158
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,360
and will route to the right
human at the right time.

159
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,370
The second prediction that we have,

160
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,030
just like that average speed
to answer concept goes away,

161
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,310
we think hold times vanish as well.

162
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,780
I was at a breakfast yesterday

163
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,000
where the person next to me said

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
they're actually calling
a lot more frequently

165
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,690
into their favorite brand

166
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,030
because the call gets picked up instantly.

167
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,870
And so I think we have
this perverse impact

168
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,450
where people don't pick up the
phone or don't call a brand

169
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,850
because they know the
experience is so shitty,

170
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,940
and in the future, as the
quality of service improves,

171
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,460
as AI is fronting some of these calls,

172
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,610
we see a renaissance of
interactions with brands,

173
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,500
and we think that's a good thing.

174
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,290
But as level 1 and level 200 work,

175
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,480
the easy stuff gets automated,

176
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,150
we see the average handle
time starting to increase

177
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,990
because it's the complex pieces
of work that hits humans.

178
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,690
So again, our perspective
on the contact center

179
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,520
and the value that it's driving

180
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,990
needs to fundamentally shift

181
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,630
as we drive up the voice volume.

182
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,310
And that's necessarily a good thing

183
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,400
because we think that
speaking to your customers,

184
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,620
solving their issues,
resolving their issues,

185
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,820
and also giving our agents
time to upsell, to cross-sell,

186
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,280
to actually properly service customers

187
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,430
delivers fundamental
value to the business.

188
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,493
Going back to the quality conversation,

189
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,510
there was a clear view from our customers

190
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,680
and those we surveyed

191
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,920
that the satisfaction
ultimately will be higher

192
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,410
from AI-only interactions.

193
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,050
What we heard from the leaders
was ultimately customers

194
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,530
won't care whether they're
speaking to an AI or a human

195
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,050
so long as their issues are resolved.

196
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,410
And so I would say as long
as the quality is there,

197
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,810
we also agree that the
satisfaction will be higher,

198
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,930
and we're doing a lot
of work around voice AI,

199
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,850
executing procedures, self-serve,

200
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,700
making the interactions
feel really natural

201
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,500
to make sure we get to this outcome.

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,610
I think that one of the biggest
shifts in the contact center

203
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,880
is the definition of the
roles fundamentally shifts.

204
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,450
So I shared level 100 and
200 we believe goes away

205
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,940
and is replaced by automation.

206
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,590
level 200 and level 300

207
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,370
we believe become what we call VIP agents.

208
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,050
And then the question comes,

209
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,780
what happens with the workforce planners,

210
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,450
with the folks who design the IVRs,

211
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,610
what happens with the quality managers?

212
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,070
What happens with the schedulers

213
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,190
and the outbound agents?
And the list goes on.

214
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,930
What happens with all of these folks?

215
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,690
We think sort of a new role
in the contact center is born

216
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,850
and this is what customers told us

217
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,660
of something that we're coining
the AI service architect.

218
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,720
These are the folks that are
deeply thinking about prompts,

219
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,150
that are thinking about correcting AI,

220
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,060
that they're thinking about
kind of managing the cockpits

221
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,260
of human and digital workers
working together in symbiosis,

222
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,450
and essentially, like, a
higher order of thinking

223
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,363
as the orchestrator in the contact center.

224
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,940
What's interesting in the Zendesk platform

225
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,460
is because we've got so much case data

226
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,620
and we've got such a
legacy of understanding

227
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,380
what customers call in and message about,

228
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,820
we're actually able to use that now

229
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,550
to interrogate the knowledge
base of the customer,

230
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,350
having 40 or 50,000 customers

231
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,090
using knowledge bases on Zendesk,

232
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,370
to look at gaps in their knowledge base

233
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,130
and automatically generate
new knowledge articles

234
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,320
based on the case history.

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,930
And then those new articles
are reviewed by humans

236
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,970
or these AI service architects

237
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,500
and then get fed into the AI

238
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,180
to then drive more self-service,

239
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,470
and that resolution loop
continues going round and round.

240
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,850
So we think this title,

241
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,610
watch LinkedIn over the next year or two,

242
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,280
we predict the AI service architect

243
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,570
is gonna be a role for the future

244
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,420
that's gonna be incredibly important.

245
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,730
But then how do we
measure all of this stuff?

246
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,330
Because if we've said average
handle time is broken,

247
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,570
the speed to answer is
going to be milliseconds,

248
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,930
and I think most people
that I polled yesterday

249
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,840
and in fact the thousand
customers we spoke to

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,430
all had varying degrees of
abuse and disgust at CSAT,

251
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,500
so what's left?

252
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
How do we figure out
whether our contact center

253
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,960
is operating as it should

254
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,923
and delighting our customers?

255
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,460
We think that feedback is gonna evolve

256
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,920
from being something
that happens after a call

257
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,380
or after an interaction
to an always-on discipline

258
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,880
where you're taking
signals from sentiment,

259
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,280
you're taking signals
from whether the outcome

260
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,170
was resolved for the customer,

261
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,110
you're listening to the
tonality of the voice,

262
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,260
the pace of speech, the emotion,

263
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,990
and essentially coming up with
new ways to track ultimately

264
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,030
to make sure we've resolved the issue

265
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,800
or we've driven repeat business

266
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,801
or upsell from that particular customer.

267
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,910
I come from the hospitality world,

268
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,710
that was my previous role

269
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,110
before being in the
contact center industry.

270
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,810
And it always amazed me
that the unit of measure

271
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,470
in the hotel was that you
would send a guest an email

272
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,720
a week or two after they checked out

273
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,777
and you would ask a question,

274
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,180
"Would you recommend this to a friend?"

275
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,740
Or, "How was your stay?"

276
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,500
The issue with that is it's
typically two weeks too late,

277
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
they've forgotten about the experience

278
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,490
or it's looking in the rear-view mirror.

279
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,700
The best measurements
happen in the moment.

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,830
And so we think now using AI,

281
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,070
we have a real opportunity
to understand the nuances,

282
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,160
the language, and the reasons for the call

283
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,750
and build up new dashboards

284
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,600
and insights to understand the customer.

285
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,630
We recently acquired a
company called HyperArc,

286
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,400
which is a digital insight,

287
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,710
almost like a data analyst in your pocket.

288
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,000
That's not the official brand term.

289
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,760
I'll probably get told off from
our PR team for saying that.

290
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,380
But essentially what that platform does,

291
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,790
it ingests all of the data

292
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,490
from all of the products across Zendesk

293
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,180
and allows you in natural
language to interrogate that data.

294
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,850
So it could be, "Why did my call volume

295
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,637
spike last Wednesday at 2:00 PM?"

296
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,340
And you can actually
drill all the way down

297
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,540
to the ticket in Zendesk

298
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,600
or get the higher-order
thinking and insight.

299
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,580
And it's got a concept of memories.

300
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,560
So every time you
interrogate the platform,

301
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,260
it uses a memory from the questions

302
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,990
that you asked at proceeding,
just like a human would.

303
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,720
And so over time, this platform, HyperArc,

304
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,010
gets smarter and smarter

305
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,190
and we sort of view that as
the future of navigation,

306
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,860
the future of really understanding deeply

307
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,540
the contact center.

308
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,950
But I started this talk

309
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,440
saying that the customers we speak to

310
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,070
and the customers we interviewed

311
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,210
feel like they're in,

312
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,780
well, feel like they're on
a plane, driving the plane,

313
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,900
changing the tires, and kind
of refueling all in one go

314
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,480
because there's so much
change in their world.

315
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,200
They sort of don't know
even where to start.

316
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,190
And what we've seen

317
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,750
and what we've understood
from our customers,

318
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,700
the ones that are most successful

319
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,570
take really discrete use
cases or micro moments

320
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,630
and reimagine them for an AI-first world,

321
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,000
implement them, A/B test,

322
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,170
have a look at the outcome,

323
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,910
and then they continue to roll those out.

324
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,230
And so our most successful
customers start small

325
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,420
and continue to grow and test and learn

326
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,410
and treat every interaction
as a learning experience.

327
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,500
It's still remarkable
to me that, you know,

328
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,700
some of our contact center clients

329
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,280
might have a thousand agents,

330
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,550
50 of whom will give out
incorrect information

331
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,470
all day long, every day.

332
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,170
And that's just viewed as par for course

333
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,520
in the contact center.

334
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,760
But as soon as a digital agent
gives one incorrect answer,

335
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,800
it's sort of code red issue.

336
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,410
And I think we're
starting to get over that,

337
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,740
but I think until we've
got a spirit of innovation

338
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,760
and, you know, a a want to try and test

339
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,890
within the contact center with AI,

340
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,210
I don't think we're gonna progress

341
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,853
as fast as other
disciplines of technology.

342
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,480
So I've given you a little
bit of a high overview

343
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,280
of what we see coming in the market.

344
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,537
I think the question that
Jay asked me backstage

345
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:28,650
from his college days,

346
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,110
well, the gremlins of the slides,

347
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,943
his college days is,

348
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:36,150
"Why is Zendesk talking
about contact center?"

349
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,640
So we announced the general availability

350
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,770
of Zendesk Contact Center,

351
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,040
which is a fully native, scalable,

352
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,680
resilient voice platform

353
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,480
that we believe can go toe to toe

354
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,190
with the best in the market

355
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,160
that is fully embedded
and native within Zendesk,

356
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,820
so that you can actually have
all of your communication

357
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,720
in one place

358
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,400
and orchestrate your AI,

359
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,280
your journeys, your quality management,

360
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,980
all in one place across all channels.

361
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,220
Our voice channel is in
partnership with Amazon Connect.

362
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,950
I don't know how the
slides keep changing it,

363
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,163
it must be very tired
as well on a Wednesday.

364
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,160
But AI and some of the voice capabilities

365
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
are in partnership with Amazon Connect.

366
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,990
We were very fortunate to be announced

367
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,600
as the global CX partner of the year

368
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,580
earlier in the week.

369
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,160
So Zendesk obviously
being the case management,

370
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,150
the quality, a single
platform without middleware,

371
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,960
and AWS providing us
world-class telephony,

372
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,520
resilience, AI routing,
and rich data and context

373
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,470
for our contact center platform.

374
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,380
And essentially, we
sort of center and focus

375
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,290
on four key value props for our customers.

376
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,643
AI that's built in.

377
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,260
It's interesting, some of
the contact center platforms

378
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,510
that are viewed as quite
modern, the SaaS platforms,

379
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,470
already coming on 10, 15 years of age,

380
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,840
the Zendesk Contact Center
platform being a year old

381
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,120
was sort of born in an AI era

382
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,030
and born from an AI-first architecture.

383
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,970
So we're not sort of
bolting on third-party bots

384
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,720
or third-party AI because
it's built into the platform.

385
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,680
We provide support for
the entire platform,

386
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,930
and as I said from the
resolution learning loop,

387
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,730
because your calls, because your tickets,

388
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,770
because your cases are in one platform,

389
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,350
we can learn from those, train the AI

390
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,840
and obviously you get a really nice loop,

391
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,660
a resolution learning
that that closes the loop

392
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,970
with the AI to make the human agents

393
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,490
more efficient and superhuman,

394
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,823
and makes the AI smarter and
smarter throughout the process.

395
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,490
Ultimately, what we see is a customer

396
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,740
should be able to contact
you on their own terms,

397
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,420
on their channel of choice.

398
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,700
So they might start on digital messaging,

399
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,250
they might get cut off
going into the car park,

400
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,720
that might trigger an outbound call

401
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,550
from Zendesk to the customer.

402
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,230
And if you can't get through, you know,

403
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,110
the AI then might leave a
message on the voicemail

404
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,630
and continue in an in-app experience.

405
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,110
Ultimately, a really
seamless, frictional journey

406
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,420
orchestrated with one set of AI,

407
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,183
automated in one platform,
which is Zendesk.

408
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,360
We already have customers

409
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,280
where we're seeing significant value.

410
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,730
This was for a fast food chain

411
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,520
where the after-call work went
down by about five minutes

412
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,460
and the average handle
time was down by about 50%.

413
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,390
And so that's happening

414
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,910
because we've got AI concierge up front.

415
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,800
When the calls actually
land with human agents,

416
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,930
we're supporting them with copilots.

417
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,270
A lot of the after call work is automated

418
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,890
from intelligent triage,

419
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,430
from sentiment, and from
the routing and follow up.

420
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,170
So we're driving tangible results,

421
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,330
and we wanna focus on those resolutions

422
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,250
and the outcomes for customers

423
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,410
and focus on driving those

424
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,160
rather than sort of dwelling
on some of the metrics

425
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,950
that no longer matter
within the contact center.

426
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,740
So thank you very much for
your time and your attention.

427
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,040
The Zendesk booth and some of
my very intelligent colleagues

428
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,940
are down there at the end.

429
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,963
It's in green.

430
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,630
We can actually buy Zendesk Contact Center

431
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,370
on AWS Marketplace,

432
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,880
and obviously that draws down
against your PPA and your EDP,

433
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,550
and it's all hosted on AWS as well.

434
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,680
So we're really excited
to have won the award.

435
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,450
We've been really excited by the momentum

436
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,550
and the partnership with Amazon Connect.

437
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,110
Delighted to have a number of our partners

438
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,550
globally in the audience.

439
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,980
Thank you very much for your
time, and enjoy re:Invent.

440
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,190
Hopefully we survive two more days.

441
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,763
Thank you very much.
