1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,990
- Wonderful. Well, thanks
for joining us, everybody.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,540
Either you're very
interested in the journey

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,820
to the autonomous
enterprise, or you're lost.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,920
Either way, we appreciate you being here.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,250
I'm super excited to be
with Mark from Genworth.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,930
We'll go into a little
bit of our background

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,760
and talk about what we're
seeing in the market,

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,670
more specifically how
Genworth is optimizing

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,400
some of their enterprise
business process workflows

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,330
through Amazon Connect

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,360
and some of the other AWS technologies.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,430
Cool, so you wanna start with your intro?

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,440
- Yeah, Mark Downey.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,250
I started at Genworth about 13 years ago.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,150
I currently own the telecom

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,113
and now most recently the
AWS Connect experience.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,950
And yeah.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,300
- Awesome.
- Great.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,100
- My name's Matt Arellano

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,570
I'm a senior vice president,

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,426
helped to lead the Amazon Business Group,

22
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:55,290
AWS Business Group for Genpact.

23
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,450
My background's about 22 years management,

24
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,590
technology, consulting.

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,720
I was actually acquired into Genpact.

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,040
I was fortunate enough to be a president

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
and co-founder of a firm

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,500
that they acquired a few months ago.

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,480
And before that I led
the global strategy team

30
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,890
in another large GSI,

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,590
but always around data, business process,

32
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,480
at the intersection of
artificial intelligence.

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,790
So look forward to the conversation today.

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,030
Awesome, so a couple
topics we wanna talk about.

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,490
So we're gonna cover off on the journey

36
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,410
to the autonomous enterprise.

37
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,350
Help to define what
autonomy ultimately is.

38
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,370
I think that's a somewhat

39
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,040
of a contested conversation these days

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
as it relates to how much autonomy,

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,700
where the human actually sits

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,660
within the conversation
around agents within the loop,

43
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,670
the collaborator with the agents,

44
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,400
and touch on modernization and
what it means to modernize.

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,260
Mark's gonna go into some detail

46
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,200
around how Genworth modernized
their infrastructure

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,330
and some of their core business processes.

48
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,450
Talk about real-world autonomy in action.

49
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,640
Talk about the leadership mindset shift.

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,760
We're seeing obviously much of
this push from the top down.

51
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,790
I think 12 months ago it was
very much so a board directive.

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,870
I think it still is,

53
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,600
but now it's starting to
trickle down to line of business

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,690
and how do you optimize your
business process from copilot

55
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,990
all the way through truly
agentic-based business processes.

56
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,890
Answer some questions,

57
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,980
and then talk about the future
and some closing takeaways.

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,400
So with that, the journey to autonomy.

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
So setting the stage here.

60
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,810
So over the course of the last, let's say,

61
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,260
seven to ten years, I believe
most of you in the room,

62
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,480
our customers, and excuse me, Genworth,

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,700
have moved from migration.

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,340
You've seen this migration of
your legacy application estate

65
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,470
and your data estate
into the cloud, right?

66
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,260
Providing that scalability, resiliency,

67
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,930
governance, control, and optimization.

68
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,600
As we think about moving
towards this modernized state,

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,570
we believe this opportunity
of modernization

70
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,340
access this runway,

71
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,740
and autonomy allows you
kind of to take off,

72
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,760
to truly rethink from a
first principle perspective,

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,990
your business processes.

74
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,310
So unencumbered,

75
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,681
taking away some of those legacy SOPs

76
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,880
and really transforming.

77
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,940
And that's how you can optimize process.

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,773
That's how you can get

79
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:06,423
towards this future state of autonomy.

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,060
We did some primary research.

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,650
We're actually gonna
release it in January.

82
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,320
So I hope we have the opportunity
to send to everybody here.

83
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,930
And from there, what we actually found,

84
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,700
which I find fairly compelling,

85
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,730
is about 12% of the senior
execs that we spoke with

86
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,910
believe they're on the path

87
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,080
towards autonomy with AI embedded, scaled,

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,660
and ultimately governed
across their business.

89
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,910
So that might seem like
actually a high number,

90
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,180
but I think as you have
been across the conference

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,920
over the last two days,

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,230
you heard agents about 4,000 times.

93
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,100
And we'll continue to hear them

94
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,200
over the course of the next three days.

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
I think most organizations

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,770
probably would think they're on that path,

97
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,410
but it's definitely something that is,

98
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,270
I believe we're all looking to achieve.

99
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,836
But the opportunity to get there,

100
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,540
there's many steps in,

101
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,590
that need to be in place,

102
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,680
of which Mark will talk
about how Genworth got there.

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,190
So moving from AI-assisted
to this concept of autonomy.

104
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,300
So what we're seeing in the rise,

105
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,520
so what is this autonomous enterprise?

106
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,720
So multi-agent, this ecosystem,
the keynote this morning,

107
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,910
talk about ecosystem of capabilities,

108
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,390
aging core with things like observability,

109
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,410
the learning model,

110
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,300
some of the recursive
nature of these models,

111
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,720
I think is fairly compounding
in the effect of those.

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,610
The management of complex workflows,

113
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,920
I'll talk about first
principles a few times.

114
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,530
But the ability to truly
build with first principles

115
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,360
I think is fairly compelling.

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,760
So as you think about leveraging agents,

117
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,010
try to take that first principle approach.

118
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,440
You can manage kind of
the existing processes

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,450
that you have and rebuild
with first principles

120
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,550
and see where there's points of friction

121
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,880
with compliance and
regulatory and security teams.

122
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,980
Responsibility by design,

123
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,533
so from the infrastructure,
data, model layer,

124
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,480
all the way through the outcome,

125
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,270
you really need to think
about the responsibility

126
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,370
and how having regulatory and compliance

127
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,630
have a seat at the table,

128
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,340
working with a large banking customer.

129
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,790
And most of their agentic use
cases actually get filtered

130
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,440
through their compliance team to start,

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,790
just to make sure that they understand

132
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,460
the regulatory posture
and the potential risk

133
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,500
before they deploy these agents.

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,660
AI is a collaborator and not a manager.

135
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,070
I think this is really important.

136
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,350
So AI and human as a collaborator.

137
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,450
So bringing those two tenants together

138
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,180
and making sure you
understand how the human

139
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,890
and the agent need to work together

140
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,140
and having the off-ramps necessary.

141
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,800
So when the probabilistic
nature of these outcomes

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
and the answers really need to be governed

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,150
and managed by humans.

144
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,510
And finally always on, always
learning, so on and so forth.

145
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,920
But the path towards
this concept of autonomy

146
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,900
we believe takes three stages, right?

147
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,220
It's really three phases.

148
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,560
Most of you are probably
familiar with the first one,

149
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,330
which is the copilot, right?

150
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,900
But it's hard to bank
returns of a copilot.

151
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,380
So what's 10% of your efficiency in a day,

152
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,310
the compounding effect

153
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,670
of that 10% across your 50,000 employees,

154
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,990
it's hard to kind of underwrite

155
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,090
that return from a CFO perspective.

156
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,280
So while that's unlocking knowledge,

157
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,010
it's unlocking the experience
of most individuals.

158
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,600
I think for the office of the CFO,

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,950
and as you think about presenting this

160
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,750
to the street or your shareholders,

161
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,460
it's very much so hard.

162
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,780
But by contrast,

163
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,400
we're starting to see the acceleration

164
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,060
of vertical use cases at
the departmental level

165
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,970
and multi-agent workflows
at the enterprise level

166
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,480
that are truly targeting
measurable outcomes.

167
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,410
So whether it's the
return of bad debt, right,

168
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,870
whether it's the optimization of agents,

169
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,940
right, of call activity,

170
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,260
it really becomes important.

171
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,010
So what you measure
determines that answer.

172
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,410
And the returns should also include

173
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,780
this concept of AI fluency,

174
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,300
or actually the capability compounds

175
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,620
across thousands of tasks.

176
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,910
So that sets the stage for
this P&L impact that, you know,

177
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,880
I believe is in phase two
and three of this journey.

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,210
So most people start with
the copilot use cases,

179
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,520
which I think are fairly impactful,

180
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,570
but that opportunity to
bank returns for your CFO

181
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,180
and show that we're actually
optimizing the business

182
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,060
I think is something that most
organizations aspire towards.

183
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,100
And we see that in kind of
the second and third phase,

184
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,010
which is vertical use cases

185
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,370
and then kind of into this
full end-to-end agentic.

186
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,560
But Mark, for you, within Genworth-

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,730
- Yeah.
- How are you guys seeing

188
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,500
kind of the agent experience?

189
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,990
- Yeah, so you know, it's exactly that.

190
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,450
We started copilot,

191
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,970
and it's really testing the waters, right?

192
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,980
And you see a lot of that.

193
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,810
But those early wins start to
build that snowball towards,

194
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,820
okay, now, where else can we use it?

195
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,080
Who else has it, you
know, in a native way?

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,170
And, you know, how I'm thinking about it

197
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,650
is a lot with how do we enable our agents

198
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,720
to have a much more human experience

199
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,977
with the callers, right?

200
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,330
There are customers, policy holders.

201
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,880
We wanna make sure that when they call us,

202
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
they're not sitting through,

203
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,890
you know, tippity tap, ah, my
computer's slow, I'm sorry.

204
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,670
And, you know, that's
always been a frustration

205
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,970
with that caller experience.

206
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,420
The caller never makes that
connection to our agents.

207
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,950
And, you know, what we've been able to do

208
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,610
and what we're looking to
do as the journey goes on

209
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,930
is have the AI fetch all
of that data ahead of time.

210
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,420
You know, we start with
when the caller comes in,

211
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,790
we've identified 'em, we
know their policy number,

212
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,480
start pulling all that,
getting that, you know,

213
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,050
all of the previous call history in line.

214
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,820
And then, you know, when the agent starts,

215
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,400
they kind of have that
right in front of them

216
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,220
in a way that they haven't before.

217
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,053
- It's interesting.

218
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:53,910
We spent some time with the
Connect team earlier today,

219
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,950
and they were talking
about leveraging Connect,

220
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,830
not only just for kinda
the agent experience,

221
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,950
but effectuating kind of the
end-to-end business process.

222
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,260
So whether for a
healthcare company driving

223
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,740
towards the collection
of appeals information.

224
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,390
So really using that agent

225
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,280
to augment the human in many cases,

226
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,050
take it all the way through
kind of the last mile.

227
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,370
So you guys experiencing that?

228
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,720
- Yeah, absolutely.

229
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,980
And that, and we're seeing that, you know,

230
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,440
particularly on the claims
side where, you know,

231
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,330
the claims are sent in electronically

232
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,170
and we can actually
take anywhere, you know,

233
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,780
it used to be three weeks to pay a claim.

234
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,640
Now we're down to a matter of days

235
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,470
because we can identify, you know, oh,

236
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,140
this is duplicate, this
is potential fraud.

237
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,210
We can find all those early

238
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,710
and get those in front of a human,

239
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,830
but the vast majority of
'em were able to just say,

240
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,450
yeah, you know, that can be paid.

241
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,270
That's normal claim, right?
- Yeah. That's amazing.

242
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,660
We were speaking to a
healthcare client most recently,

243
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
and their biggest fear

244
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,040
was the external and internal agent clash.

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,860
So you have an authorization on one side,

246
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,390
the agent produces the authorization,

247
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,740
helps to orchestrate
that on the other end.

248
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,300
You have the denial, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,860
- So you just keep going back and forth

250
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,450
and the agent keeps prepping information

251
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,283
and resubmitting it,

252
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:05,790
and the other agent keeps denying it

253
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,640
based on some level of
medical information.

254
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,072
So do you guys have any of
that experience or occasion?

255
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,070
- Not as yet.

256
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,125
You know, for, you know,

257
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:21,125
once we run it through the
process, it's really, you know,

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,600
that final eyes on it,
human eyes, that we'll say,

259
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,910
and we don't send, you know,
any of that back through.

260
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,170
It's, agent has said, you
know, it goes, it goes.

261
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,280
- Got it.
- So yeah.

262
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,690
- Cool.
- Making sure

263
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,400
that human in the loop has the final say.

264
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,250
- That's awesome.

265
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,410
So we see progress,

266
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,210
and I think we heard
that today in the keynote

267
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,140
and we will continue to
hear the progress around AI.

268
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,800
So the foundation, though,
we believe is somewhat weak.

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,840
And I think most of folks in the room

270
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,320
are probably struggling
with the architecture,

271
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,940
the interaction of these agents,

272
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,080
how they need to come together,

273
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
how you need to govern
agent-to-agent interaction,

274
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,030
the data that sits underneath.

275
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,730
What we've seen kind of in our experience

276
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,460
is about 50% of executives expect

277
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,220
autonomous decision making in three years,

278
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,680
which is a fairly
significant amount of money,

279
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,410
or excuse me, a percentage
from a Fortune, you know,

280
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,540
Fortune 500, Global 2000 perspective.

281
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,680
But 3% are implementing
orchestration today.

282
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,690
I think orchestration is a heavy topic

283
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,770
around how you're gonna move

284
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,710
from human into agent into the layers

285
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,070
that sit underneath and
kind of this API level.

286
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,890
But what we're seeing is the barriers

287
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,020
and where focus needs to be applied

288
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,810
over the coming 36 months, skill.

289
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,060
So we're spending a
significant amount of time,

290
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,740
money, and energy in upskilling,

291
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,810
and we believe everyone in the enterprise

292
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,160
should be a practitioner, right?

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,487
So we should all be practitioners.

294
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:52,542
- Absolutely.
- Are you seeing that

295
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,277
within Genworth?
- Absolutely.

296
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:59,220
You know, we've recently rolled
out to everybody, you know,

297
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,120
this kind of launching
service where, you know,

298
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,510
they can go classes, learn
their prompting, learn,

299
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,520
here's what these things
are doing in the background,

300
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,290
all that kind of stuff.

301
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,700
We also recently set up our AI CoE, right,

302
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,960
Center of Excellence.

303
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,300
And that's key, 'cause they can, you know,

304
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,850
kind of oversee all of the aspects

305
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,790
of where it's being used
to make sure, you know,

306
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,360
is this the right use case
or have you, you know,

307
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
have you put the right controls on this?

308
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,793
And, I mean, that's critical.

309
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,970
You know, data, you know, data,

310
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,880
we've always had data governance in place,

311
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
but you really need to shore them up

312
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,460
because you're going from
humans using the data

313
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,890
to autonomous operations using the data.

314
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,450
And when you see the end result, you know,

315
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,290
it doesn't show you,

316
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,450
here's the data that got me there, right?

317
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,710
You have to go looking for that.

318
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,760
- Sure.
- And so

319
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,470
making sure that governance is upfront

320
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,600
and making sure that, you know,

321
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,240
the AI is going to use the data correctly,

322
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,760
that's, you know, that's gonna be crucial.

323
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,820
- Yeah, one question
we get off and around,

324
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,930
so two questions for you.

325
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,520
One around, who's in the CoE?

326
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,570
- Yeah.
- Who are the participants?

327
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,500
And then two,

328
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,850
do you have a separate data governance

329
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,260
and AI governance team?

330
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,870
And what's the point of
convergence there that you see?

331
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,948
- So I, you know,

332
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:24,948
we do have separate data
and AI governance and,

333
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,503
you know, they work closely
together, of course.

334
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,380
What was the first question?

335
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,450
- Who sits in that
team, the AI governance?

336
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,130
So the AI CoE and the governance team,

337
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,970
who actually sits there?

338
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,080
Compliance, regulatory.

339
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,030
- So we actually have AI,

340
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,284
our IT is in the driver's seat there.

341
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,500
- Okay.

342
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
- But, you know, compliance
is always gonna have a say in-

343
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:54,949
- Sure.
- And, you know, in fact,

344
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,580
that's been a, you know,

345
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,971
one of those constant battles
that we've had this year

346
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,500
of getting them to approve things.

347
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,090
Just as, you know,

348
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,090
I had this conversation at
lunch today where I was saying,

349
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,680
you know, just taking the simple summary

350
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,370
of the call has taken us seven months.

351
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,250
And it took, like, 20
minutes of implementation.

352
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,900
And all the rest of it was trying

353
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,955
to get the lawyers to agree.
- Right.

354
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,510
- So, you know, they're gonna have a say,

355
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,540
but we don't want them in
the driver's seat. (laughs)

356
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,373
- Makes perfect sense.

357
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:29,206
Even in data governance,

358
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,960
you get the lawyers in the
room and you can't do anything.

359
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,910
- Yeah. (laughs)

360
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,050
- Ask for forgiveness sometimes.

361
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,320
But I think it's important and instructive

362
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,120
as you're on your journey, you know,

363
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,930
towards this concept of
agentic and autonomous.

364
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,100
Who are the participants?

365
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,370
And I think in any somewhat
new wave of technology,

366
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,560
there's always the
debate of centralization

367
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,810
versus decentralization versus federation.

368
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,120
And I think control
becomes an important tenet

369
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,430
and term as you think about,

370
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,130
so how much control do you
wanna exert over the tech-

371
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,060
- Yeah.
- Over the models,

372
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,170
over the use cases.

373
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,580
So do you guys struggle

374
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,890
with how much you wanna
kind of federate this out

375
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,210
to the business and capability?

376
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,720
- It's gonna be a learning
experience that as of now,

377
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,010
right now, the CoE is mostly
there for enablement, right?

378
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,430
They're there to help get
the business off the ground

379
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,160
with the use cases that
they wanna see, right?

380
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,900
Now, there's a lot of
people clamoring for it,

381
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,290
and we wanna make sure
we just get them through

382
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,330
and thinking about it the right way

383
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,360
so that we can accelerate it

384
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,100
and get that implemented for them.

385
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,510
But-
- That's great.

386
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,640
- You know, sometimes
they just wanna throw it,

387
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,080
you know, just turn the on switch,

388
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,160
right?
- Yeah.

389
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,993
- But, you know,

390
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,975
you definitely want to make sure

391
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,780
that you've set it up directly,

392
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,520
otherwise you're gonna
get all kinds of results.

393
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,630
- Sure.

394
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,420
That's where I think
the observability aspect

395
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,220
and what we've heard from AgentCore

396
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,560
and some of the new
releases from the keynote

397
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,517
are really important and the
learning process behind that.

398
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:58,080
So how you go from
observability to learning

399
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,180
will be really important
over the coming weeks

400
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,550
and months as AgentCore becomes, you know,

401
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,430
more mainstream as the platform of choice.

402
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,000
So why this concept of modernization,

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
and Mark touched on it,

404
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,200
and modernization isn't
just infrastructure

405
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,477
or data or models,

406
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:15,720
it's kind of the entire ecosystem

407
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,730
of people, process, and technology.

408
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,200
And those tenets haven't changed

409
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,250
over the course of the last, you know,

410
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,500
40 years of technology modernization.

411
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,530
But, you know, we believe modernization

412
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,350
is obviously this concept of
resiliency and scalability.

413
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,750
And we've talked about
that in data readiness.

414
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,150
So for Genworth, obviously making sure

415
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,920
that we understand our customer, right?

416
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,570
Understand the data.
- Yep.

417
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,870
- Master data becomes very
important in this conversation.

418
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,430
So within the Connect landscape,

419
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,950
you're seeing the experience of agent,

420
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,290
the experience to outcome,

421
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,050
but the data preparation and
unstructured data tagging

422
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,550
and labeling becomes really important.

423
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,030
So have you guys had to wrestle
with any of those problems?

424
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,320
- Sure.

425
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,630
And we're continuing to, you know?

426
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,200
With the modernization project
we undertook last year,

427
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,850
we set the foundation.

428
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,770
And so we really set up for the, you know,

429
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,710
here's all the data that
the callers are gonna have,

430
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,920
you know, here's, but it
was all from the mainframe.

431
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,070
Now we're getting all the soft data.

432
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,941
What letters did we send them,
you know, in the past month?

433
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,020
What calls have they made?

434
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,000
What, you know, what
did they need last time?

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,860
Who did they talk to?

436
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,360
And we need to make use
of all that data real time

437
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
when they call back.

438
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,910
And so, you know, and it's all about

439
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,859
making sure that it's set up,

440
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,400
it's accessible, and, yeah,

441
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,250
like you said, tagged properly, right?

442
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,960
- We were in a session earlier today,

443
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,790
and one of the Connect leaders said,

444
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,680
if the prompt or the
customer service reaction is,

445
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,510
you know, thanks for
calling, how can I help you?

446
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,343
- Yeah.
- You've already lost

447
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:56,430
the call.
- Yeah, yeah.

448
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,580
- So you should know why
people are looking to engage,

449
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,610
what their problems are,
the background behind it.

450
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,980
You know, it's like when my
cable goes out and I call

451
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,960
and the first thing they
ask me to do is, you know,

452
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,070
reset my router,

453
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,290
which I've now done four
times before I called, right?

454
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,496
Because what would you do when you-

455
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:12,329
- Yeah, that's the first thing.

456
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,530
- That's exactly right.

457
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,580
- Turn it off, turn it on.

458
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,470
- So that end-to-end experience

459
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,530
and understanding the problem,

460
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,750
having some kind of intuition behind it,

461
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,580
but trying to solve it end to end

462
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,260
through this agentic approach
I think is important.

463
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,093
- Yeah.

464
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,453
- Yeah.

465
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,930
So skipping steps as it
relates to these pilots.

466
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,450
So I think most people
started with, you know,

467
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,730
single agent pilots, you
know, getting to multi-agent.

468
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,070
I think this concept of end-to-end agentic

469
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,750
across your primary workflows,

470
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,270
order to cash, record to report,

471
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,850
source to pay will be an evolution.

472
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,427
I think you're seeing many
people trying to focus on,

473
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:54,060
you know, the back and forth

474
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,040
of probabilistic versus deterministic.

475
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,690
And when it becomes deterministic,

476
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,600
how do you use in AWS
terms like lambda functions

477
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,940
to do that versus the
experience of, you know,

478
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,410
using something like AgentCore.

479
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,490
- Right.
- Or obviously Bedrock.

480
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,660
But do you guys kind of think

481
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,160
about the application of agents

482
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,590
and when it becomes more
business role driven

483
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,120
versus where you actually need the agent

484
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,980
to function and have intuition?

485
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,180
- Sure, we've been, you know,

486
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,400
we've been doing a lot of experimentation.

487
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,510
None of this is in our
production environment yet.

488
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,510
But, you know, if you think
about the IVR experience,

489
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,530
when somebody calls in,

490
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,320
the old approach and our
current production approach

491
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,750
is you have all these utterances

492
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,273
and they all point to a
number of cues, right?

493
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,530
It's very labor intensive
to update that list,

494
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,640
make sure it's, you know,

495
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,260
relevant and it's going to the right queue

496
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,550
and all that kind of stuff.

497
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,340
Well, now what we can do is we can say,

498
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,540
here are my queues,

499
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,013
here's what they can do.

500
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,670
Just take whatever the customer asked for,

501
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,840
send that through Bedrock,
and let Bedrock say,

502
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,220
here's the best place to send it.

503
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,280
And we find, you know, and
again, this is development,

504
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,090
but we're finding it very
reliable to get it to a queue

505
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,550
that can actually handle their call.

506
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,450
And that, you know, instantly, you know,

507
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,970
maximizes how many
utterances you can handle,

508
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,710
'cause it's infinite.

509
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,350
And, you know, if you have a new event

510
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,500
that the caller might call back about,

511
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,960
you can just put that in
one of the queues and say,

512
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,290
I take these kind of calls, and
then instantly it's updated.

513
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,730
- That's amazing.
- And that updates

514
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,680
your whole routing, so, you know,

515
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,410
the speed in which you
can react goes from,

516
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,260
you know, two weeks to two minutes.

517
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,690
- Have you, we talked about today

518
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,520
and yesterday with a few clients,

519
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,230
this concept of fine-tuning, right?

520
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,820
And I think fine-tuning the model

521
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
based on your semantic and
language, do you guys see that?

522
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,790
Are the foundational models
precise enough, right,

523
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,830
for the-
- For this, yeah.

524
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,280
For this particular use case
that I'm mentioning, yeah,

525
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,540
we're using a miniature model
to get it as fast as possible.

526
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,440
- Yep.

527
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,750
- Because you don't want
somebody waiting there, you know?

528
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,600
- Right.
- Listening to whole music.

529
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,860
So, and we found that
that has been just fine

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,540
for being able to accurately
get it to the right cue.

531
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,562
No tuning, just out of the box.

532
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,920
- That's pretty crazy.
- Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

533
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,270
- That's amazing.
- From what we used to have.

534
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,390
You know, prior to AWS, we were on Nuance.

535
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,070
Nuance takes that say anything main menu

536
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,250
and they compile it.

537
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,310
So all we received was a binary.

538
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,680
To update that binary,

539
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,110
you would go through a
back and forth process

540
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,590
that would be several months just to get,

541
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,441
can we add one phrase? (laughs)

542
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,700
So, yeah.

543
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
- So that kind of brings

544
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,090
to the last point of legacy systems.

545
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,220
So you had Nuance prior to,

546
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,560
obviously moving to Connect
is a different experience,

547
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
a different set of capabilities.

548
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,540
But how much did the
legacy either set you back,

549
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,240
or how much of that did
you need to prepare for-

550
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,170
- Right.
- Before unlocking

551
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,050
capabilities-
- So, yeah, so we were,

552
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,480
you know, we were not

553
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,200
on the newest version of Nuance either.

554
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,610
Ours was about 15 years.

555
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,320
- Makes it easier. I'm just kidding.

556
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,390
- Yeah, 15, well, it makes it easier,

557
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,822
'cause you just start with a-

558
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:21,180
- Just to turn it off.

559
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,100
Unplug it from the wall.
- Burn it down.

560
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,700
But yeah, you really do have
to restart at that point.

561
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,533
'Cause, you know,

562
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,830
none of it was portable
except for the utterances.

563
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,270
- Yeah.
- We were able to import

564
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,890
the 4,000 phrases,

565
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,563
but now we're gonna throw
'em out, so. (laughs)

566
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:39,450
But, yeah, so, you know,

567
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,610
legacy really was holding us back.

568
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,590
And, you know, we had identified that

569
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,680
and we had gone through several
iterations of, you know,

570
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,230
what do we want to do with the experience?

571
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,870
And it wasn't really until we identified,

572
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,580
you know, what's our North Star here?

573
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,410
And it started with that
customer experience.

574
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,133
How do we really, you
know, make the customer,

575
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,580
you know, satisfied when they call?

576
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,260
We don't necessarily
want them to call back,

577
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,180
you know, reduce the call with volume.

578
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,420
But we wanna make sure that
they had a good experience,

579
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,013
right, and so, you know,

580
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,120
within two months of
us rolling out Connect,

581
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,670
we saw our CSAT scores up 14 points.

582
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,649
- Yeah, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

583
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:25,110
And yeah, it's been transformative.

584
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,850
And the speed in which
we're able to react,

585
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,393
like I said, you know, being
able to implement changes,

586
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,247
you know, a week instead of a month or,

587
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,760
you know, whatever it be,

588
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,780
it's been fantastic.

589
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,630
- That's awesome.

590
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,660
So Mark's gonna talk, as he has,

591
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,340
for the better part of
the last 27 minutes,

592
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,380
about the Genworth journey.

593
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,050
But talk a little bit
about kinda this concept

594
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,810
of predictive, right, self-healing,

595
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,643
and maybe a little bit

596
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,750
about where you see the
journey next, right?

597
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,820
What's upcoming?
- Yeah.

598
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,600
So a lot of things of what
we're working on right now is,

599
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,070
again, on that predictive routing.

600
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,430
I mentioned kind of what
we're working on there with,

601
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,133
you know, take whatever
the customer has said,

602
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,710
what they've indicated to us,

603
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,190
and get an LLM to identify what queue

604
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,983
are they gonna need to go to?

605
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:17,733
What kind of help do they need?

606
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,750
The other thing we do is we see, you know,

607
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,060
did they just talk to
somebody 15 minutes ago?

608
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,610
Can we just connect them back to them?

609
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,780
Because that's, you know,

610
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,040
and a lot of times that's really helpful

611
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,780
'cause you don't have to
start from square one.

612
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,613
- Sure.

613
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,490
So the predictive
routing, the self-healing,

614
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,470
that's something that
we're working on right now

615
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,030
is we're looking at, okay,

616
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,170
how do we take our CloudWatch
data and identify, okay,

617
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,480
we seem to have some audio issues here

618
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,506
in the Philippines or in Belize.

619
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:57,480
How do we start to put in the
processes to get that fixed,

620
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,320
get that healing?

621
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,510
'Cause that's been a challenge for us as,

622
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,510
you know, some agents in far-off places

623
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,380
having audio issues or particular
agents having mic issues.

624
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,050
It'd be great to be able
to identify, hey, you know,

625
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,690
we're getting sound quality
issues out of this agent,

626
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,800
and reach out to them.

627
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,990
Don't wait for them to
reach out to the help desk.

628
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,847
So that's one thing that
we're working on now

629
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:21,930
is how do we utilize all
that data streaming in

630
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,330
to identify things upfront?

631
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,210
- That classification
problem, while basic, right,

632
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,220
but just classification and queuing

633
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,180
could make a huge difference

634
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,692
on kind of who takes
the call and resolution.

635
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:33,930
- Exactly. Exactly.
- Yeah.

636
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,790
- And if they call into
the help desk, you know,

637
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,407
they're gonna try debugging things for,

638
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,780
you know, 20 minutes.

639
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,700
That's 20 minutes the agent isn't off.

640
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,170
If we have already identified, hey,

641
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,273
the issue's your mic, fix your mic.

642
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,460
So this is a little bit about our journey.

643
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,020
We had 1,600 call center agents moved over

644
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,233
from our Avaya on-prem telecom.

645
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,520
So setting up how we built
our Connect flow is, you know,

646
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,430
identify the caller, find out,

647
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,160
you know, are they a real caller?

648
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,660
'Cause that still happens.

649
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,910
You still get spam
calls for a call center.

650
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,470
I don't know why.

651
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,760
It's like what do they hope to gain?

652
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,770
But you still get those.

653
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,240
So we actually-
- Competition, by the way.

654
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,140
- Yeah, exactly.

655
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,580
It's like, what is this?

656
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,490
So we've actually been
able to kind of just drop

657
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,490
all of those spam calls pretty
readily, which was great.

658
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,960
And really all we had to do is put a step

659
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,780
that would seem natural to a human,

660
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,270
but computers aren't gonna do it, right?

661
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,270
So identify the caller
call number, and again,

662
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,320
send it through the intelligent router.

663
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Did they receive a
letter that's, you know,

664
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,320
asking them to change their
rates or change their options.

665
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,940
We're gonna get them straight
to a specialized agent.

666
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,530
We're gonna skip all this,

667
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,530
get them to an agent
because they have questions

668
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,630
and this isn't gonna answer it,

669
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,980
so let's just get them to an agent.

670
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,850
- Can I ask you a question on that?

671
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,130
So you're tying campaign data-

672
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,963
- Yeah.
- Right,

673
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:20,490
into kind of the call
center so you understand

674
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,910
or can have some level of
understanding why, right?

675
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,380
And through that why then routing them

676
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,520
to the best appropriate-
- Yeah.

677
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,900
So a lot of what's our
campaigns might be is, you know,

678
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,510
hey, we need to change the
rates in your state, right?

679
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,690
You're gonna go up monthly payment,

680
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,040
10% or whatever.

681
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,940
It's kinda like healthcare.

682
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,773
- Yep.

683
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,030
- And, you know,

684
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,943
that's obviously gonna be a
stressful call for the user,

685
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,700
but we can get them to the agent

686
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,040
that will give them options, right?

687
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,630
Like, we can keep your rates the same

688
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,330
and we'll just change
these options around and,

689
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,570
you know, in a lot of cases
solve their issue, right?

690
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,420
Like, maybe you didn't
really actually need

691
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,910
this type of care that
you have a rider on.

692
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,090
So, you know, we can
take that off for you,

693
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,440
keep you where you are.

694
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,413
Those sorts of decisions
that we can walk you through.

695
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,620
But, you know,

696
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,270
they'll have received a very scary letter

697
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,590
that they don't understand.

698
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,000
- There's a compassion-
- Yeah.

699
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,110
- To the approach, too, in there.

700
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,610
- Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

701
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,980
We wanna make sure, you know,

702
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,540
it's never a fun conversation.

703
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,390
- Sure.
- Right?

704
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,993
And in a lot of cases, you know,

705
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,960
if you've seen Genworth's journey,

706
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,090
we went from, you know,

707
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,070
we were gonna be $16 billion under water

708
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,050
with some of these policies,

709
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,830
to now we're, you know, within one or two.

710
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,870
- Wow, all because of Connect-
- Over the past 10 years.

711
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,793
No.
- I'm just-

712
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,270
- (chuckles) Yeah, good call.

713
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,181
No, over the past 10 years
through these rate actions.

714
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:55,350
But you still, you're,
they're our customers.

715
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,121
We want to take care of them, right?

716
00:28:57,121 --> 00:29:02,121
But we wanna make sure that
we are solvent and able to.

717
00:29:02,136 --> 00:29:05,618
(laughs) So that's been,
it's been a journey.

718
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,990
But that's one case

719
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,950
where identifying the
caller early on in the queue

720
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,750
and not making them walk through

721
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,070
a whole lot of extra effort, you know,

722
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,373
that sort of thing can
really change the experience.

723
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,730
- Have the metrics changed?

724
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,400
So years ago, did some call center work.

725
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,840
I'm not, you are by no means an expert,

726
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,850
but things like average handling time,

727
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,930
first call resolution,

728
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,660
which just because
someone doesn't call back

729
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,310
doesn't mean you actually
resolve their problem,

730
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,143
right?
- That's true.

731
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:37,650
- I mean, they're more angry.

732
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,950
Like in healthcare, then
you follow, you know,

733
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,990
to CMS and nobody actually
wants that to happen.

734
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,880
So have you found the
metrics need to change

735
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,530
as you deploy these technologies?

736
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,350
- A lot of those metrics
have stayed the same.

737
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,940
- Okay.
- But, you know,

738
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,530
a lot of that hasn't changed yet.

739
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,213
We haven't really gotten,

740
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,770
we got the call routing in place, right?

741
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,440
We've got it easier to contact us.

742
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,370
Now we're moving on to
how do we make it easier

743
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,990
for the agent to help.

744
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,420
- Okay.
- And that's where we'll see

745
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,550
a lot of those improvements.

746
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,100
But, you know, from a net promoter score,

747
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,960
you know, obviously that has been a real,

748
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,960
they're very satisfied
talking to the Lex or, what,

749
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,588
I forget what voice we selected, right?

750
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:32,700
But that voice sounds a lot more friendly

751
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,160
than apparently what we had.
- Do you mind

752
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,250
taking a question, by the way?

753
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,610
- Sure, yeah. Absolutely.
- So you said before

754
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,080
that when they got a letter,

755
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,960
you verified that they got the letter.

756
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
- Yeah.
- More around what you mean,

757
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,770
because you said that AI
agents (speaks indistinctly).

758
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:49,937
My question is why.

759
00:30:49,937 --> 00:30:52,410
Did you consider
(indistinct) or pilots go,

760
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,944
hey, let's give the AI some options-

761
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:57,188
- Yeah.
- And explain to them,

762
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,190
clarifies and says, well, you know,

763
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,702
you have this rate
where we do X, Y, and Z,

764
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:04,250
and see how (speaks indistinctly).

765
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,980
- So yeah, we have not, but that said,

766
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,890
we're very early in our
agent implementation.

767
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,683
Like, we're at the copilot
stage, right, phase one.

768
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,820
But I mean, as we move through it,

769
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,310
I think that's a fantastic place to look.

770
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,230
- A secondary piece as well.
- Sure.

771
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,700
- [Audience Member]
Which is if you haven't,

772
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,290
so you're saying you
haven't asked that yet.

773
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,120
I wonder if you might explore that.

774
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,460
Are you still using that same capability

775
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,115
to try those options,

776
00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:33,940
(speaks indistinctly) or
copilot perspective where-

777
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,773
- Yeah.
- Okay,

778
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:37,440
maybe you're not telling
the customer these options,

779
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,623
but you're providing agents these options

780
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,910
from the system.
- Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,490
And that's certainly where
we're gonna put it first.

782
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,490
You know, one of our kind of
tenants right now is, you know,

783
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:54,875
don't force the customers to put up with,

784
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,490
you know, here are the AI options, right?

785
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,060
We've always all seen,
you know, the ChatGPT,

786
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,590
here's my opinion, right?

787
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,880
And it runs through the options.

788
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,430
We don't wanna put them
through that until it's ready.

789
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,363
So first step will be, like
you said, agent assist.

790
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,060
Present the relevant data to the agent

791
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,880
and get it in front of
them to present that.

792
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,400
But again, we're not there yet.

793
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,900
But definitely,

794
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,710
as we continue our journey
into the autonomous journey,

795
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,490
we will.

796
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,110
- I think it's a great option.

797
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,440
As you think about, again,
kind of the final response,

798
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,020
you know, agent-based, maybe
a little bit of risk there,

799
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,420
but reinforced learning,
like if the agent,

800
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,560
the human agent is the one

801
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,150
who's the arbiter of the decision

802
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,830
based on what they're
hearing from the human,

803
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,820
then they can make that decision

804
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,840
that goes back into the model.

805
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,700
So I think it's a really important point

806
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,320
and potentially a safer way to start

807
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,725
to roll this out as you get towards more-

808
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:54,660
- It's a great use case.

809
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,910
I'm gonna take that back.

810
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,140
- We talk about the AWS ecosystem.

811
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,780
So how has Connect fit
into the overall ecosystem

812
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,250
of AWS within Genworth?

813
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,620
What else sits out there across AWS?

814
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,480
- So AWS Connect

815
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,320
is definitely our biggest
implementation right now.

816
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,320
And we have the data to support it.

817
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,735
So we call it the enterprise data hub.

818
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:25,860
So those are the two
biggest implementations.

819
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,100
But then we have our customer websites

820
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,633
sitting in AWS right now.

821
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,590
Our, Pega, our customer assistant screens,

822
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,540
that's sitting in Amazon,
it's Pega's Amazon,

823
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,790
but it's still within the borders.

824
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,240
So most of our front-facing applications

825
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,430
that a customer would
deal with is in there.

826
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,500
So, you know, it really allows us

827
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,820
to do that data sharing
full circle, right?

828
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,400
If they, you know, go onto our website,

829
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,690
make an update, well,

830
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,000
the agent can already
know about that update

831
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,250
when they call, if they call.

832
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,380
And so that's something
that's important to us

833
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,470
is try to make that as
seamless as possible.

834
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,500
Again, harken back to our legacy days

835
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,960
where they make an update on the web

836
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,580
and it's gonna be like three days

837
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,260
before the agent even knows about it.

838
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,170
So, and if they call, they're
gonna be very confused.

839
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,680
And I've had many of those
conversations of, like,

840
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,810
yeah, I know we have web services,

841
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,220
but that's not, they're going
to the mainframe. (laughs)

842
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,140
- So that integrated approach-
- Yeah.

843
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,310
- What other integrations do you have

844
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,470
outside of the AWS ecosystem?

845
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,403
- We have some Azure
capabilities right now.

846
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,860
Most of that right now
is our internal systems,

847
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,060
like our analytical actuarial systems.

848
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,233
So none of them that need
that real-time connection.

849
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,650
Most of our real-time connections

850
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,420
are happening in Amazon right now.

851
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,093
- Great. That's great.

852
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,100
- What do we got here?

853
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,270
So from a capability perspective, right,

854
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,640
as you think about value
creation within gen AI

855
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,190
and kind of the current
versus future use cases.

856
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,900
So you talked about summarization.

857
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,950
- Summarization. Yeah.

858
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,153
We just got that rolled
out full agent-wide,

859
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,890
just the tail end of last month.

860
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,330
And it's funny, it took us, like I said,

861
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,830
seven months to get
through that compliance.

862
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,470
- Five days of development.
- Five days of development.

863
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,540
- 400 meetings.
- Within two weeks,

864
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,373
they were like, "Oh, yeah,

865
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,570
you can roll that out
to all your agents now."

866
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,300
So we started with two call flows.

867
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,950
Now you can just roll
it out with all of 'em.

868
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,210
It's like, okay.

869
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah. So like I said, snowball effects.

870
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,440
- Yep.
- You get one approval,

871
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,003
you prove it right.

872
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,290
It's really hard to demo with fake data.

873
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,250
- Sure.

874
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,080
- And that's something that's,

875
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,970
so it's really hard for
compliance to be like,

876
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,170
oh, yeah, that'll be fine.

877
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,419
It's like, but they don't
see the real call, right?

878
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,480
And so that's what they're
really nervous about.

879
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,950
So being able to pilot it

880
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,180
with a couple real call
flows within two weeks,

881
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,680
they were like, "Yes, this is fine.

882
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,030
We like this."

883
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,270
And the richness of the agent notes

884
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,740
that they'll have available
to them has gone up tenfold.

885
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,730
- Right.
- Like,

886
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,730
'cause now we're getting
like a paragraph of text,

887
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,143
4,000 characters or more.

888
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,310
Whereas before, you know,
in their call wrap up,

889
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,050
you know, they type a sentence,

890
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,730
maybe two.
- Sure.

891
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,530
- And now we have like a full rundown

892
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,060
of what the agent did in summary form.

893
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,473
It's been fantastic.

894
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,303
Agent assist,

895
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,030
you know, that's something

896
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,283
that we're experimenting with now,

897
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,063
but

898
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,703
auto QA is also going
live, I think, in January.

899
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,440
And one thing that we
talked about at launch

900
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,160
is kind of the limitations of the auto QA

901
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,700
of only having 10 AI actions on there.

902
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,800
So hopefully that gets raised soon

903
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,163
so we can do more and more
with it because, you know,

904
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:28,503
I think that's gonna be a really huge,

905
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,659
what they told us about today

906
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:36,120
was being able to give back
a training report, right?

907
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,120
And being able to say, here's
where your agents need,

908
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,370
you know, some extra training,
some extra validation.

909
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,923
Give that back to the
supervisor right away.

910
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,857
And, you know, it's not
something they have to go

911
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:52,560
and discover over months
of monitoring calls.

912
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,350
They can-
- More advanced observability.

913
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,480
It's limited to 10 today?

914
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,480
- The auto QA is like questions
that the AI can identify-

915
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,380
- Okay.
- In a transcript.

916
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,747
- The quality course.
- Yeah.

917
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:08,187
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

918
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:09,020
So there,

919
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,060
it was actually one of the
discussions I think yesterday,

920
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,168
and apparently it is a big interest.

921
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,770
A lot of people said they can raise that.

922
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,720
So I think there's some
discussion to that end.

923
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,847
I think (speaks indistinctly).

924
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,980
- Yeah.
- So the bottom line,

925
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,020
you really need more than 10.

926
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,010
There were some more where they talk

927
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,933
about classified goals accordingly or,

928
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:36,665
you know (speaks indistinctly).

929
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:38,333
- Yeah, great.

930
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,650
- That's very helpful. Yeah.
- Yeah.

931
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,300
- The other thing we're
gonna do early next year

932
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,720
is start experimenting
with, again, chat bots,

933
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,710
we don't wanna stick a chat
bot in front of our customers,

934
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,170
but we're okay with it
on our employees, right?

935
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,120
Let's experiment with them.

936
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,300
So, you know, our internal
help desk, you know,

937
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,610
being able to reset a
password, it can ask questions,

938
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,161
you know, it can go
fetch the magic questions

939
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:05,520
and you can answer 'em and then
it can reset your password.

940
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,270
You know, that's, and it can
do a lot more than that too.

941
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,180
'Cause it can go through the
entire SOP archive and say,

942
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,320
try these things.

943
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,600
And if that doesn't work, okay, well,

944
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,220
we'll go ahead and escalate your call.

945
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,000
So that's something that
we're about to embark on,

946
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,713
and very excited about that.

947
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,920
- On the SOP extraction,
could you just expand on that?

948
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,070
So are you using it in archive or actually

949
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,500
to help create SOPs for processes

950
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,060
of which that are yet to be fully defined?

951
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,730
- So currently pointed at the archive.

952
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,350
- Yep.
- And then

953
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,290
it can offer those
suggestions real time, right?

954
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,170
But to your point,

955
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,770
I see us being able to then say,

956
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,810
okay, now point it at, you know,

957
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,310
successful interactions

958
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,833
that it's because we
have all the transcripts,

959
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,040
create SOPs based on what actions

960
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,810
were taken that were successful.

961
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,730
And we're actually trying to do that

962
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,710
on the customer side too.

963
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,780
Help them develop their knowledge base

964
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,760
based on successful outcomes

965
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,573
and have our knowledge archive for that.

966
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,270
And then of course our knowledge archive

967
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,180
for the agents is also
gonna be AI-powered.

968
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,670
So they can ask questions

969
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,920
if they have questions
come up during the call.

970
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,980
They don't have to go surfing
through the knowledge archives

971
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,790
and try to find the right
keyword to get through task.

972
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,200
And that's a big win.

973
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,820
- Have you found the barrier

974
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,920
being somewhat of the guinea pig, right,

975
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,780
in the organization
starting, has compliance,

976
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,770
they have a better understanding.

977
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,230
I think some of the barriers
are the fear of the unknown.

978
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,790
- Oh, yes.
- Right, the starting point.

979
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,220
So you don't obviously
wanna be on the cover

980
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,260
of the Wall Street Journal as
everybody has said for years,

981
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,570
but has the barrier towards entry

982
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,880
and understanding for
compliance, for legal,

983
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,500
for regulatory dropped?

984
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,620
- It's, yeah, very much so.

985
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,450
And we've seen it, you know,

986
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,943
the tide shift almost overnight.

987
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,740
And it is about just
being able to prove, like,

988
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,990
hey, these things are useful.

989
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,590
And it's not just about
doing your job faster,

990
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,710
it's about being able
to do your job, right?

991
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,530
Like, a lot of those agent calls

992
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,180
where they would've had to
go to a knowledge archive,

993
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,350
if they can't find the article,

994
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,190
can't find that,

995
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,890
it ends in a bad experience
for the customer.

996
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,180
It ends up the, you know,

997
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,400
customer didn't get what
they needed, but, you know,

998
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,430
the agent found an article
that was able to get rid

999
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,350
of the caller, get to my next call.

1000
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,150
- Right.
- So we don't want those,

1001
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,240
right, so enable that experience,

1002
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,240
enable the human connection
between call center agent,

1003
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,120
customer service rep,
let's just call 'em reps.

1004
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,890
'Cause too many agents being thrown-

1005
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,183
- Right, that's right.

1006
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,870
- Between the rep and the customer.

1007
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,590
Make sure that we've enabled
that human connection

1008
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,650
to occur naturally.
- That's wonderful.

1009
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,610
Taking a step back,

1010
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,380
the business case that you guys had

1011
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,970
when you first sat out.
- Yeah.

1012
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,740
- What were the primary metrics and how,

1013
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,920
I know you mentioned CSAT
increasing significantly,

1014
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,790
which is fantastic.

1015
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,380
What else did you start with,

1016
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,520
and where are you seeing

1017
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
kind of the end state at this point?

1018
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,250
- The biggest use case that we had

1019
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:22,250
was our ability to react to
things that are happening.

1020
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,370
Like, being able to react to a letter

1021
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,876
that we had to send out.

1022
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:33,540
Not even just the rate action letters.

1023
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:38,540
You know, one of our
partners was a victim of the,

1024
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,850
it was the transfer software

1025
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,363
that just a couple years
ago got hacked and released.

1026
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,430
Well, they were a victim, we weren't,

1027
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,160
but they used it and so some of our data

1028
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,300
was exposed that way, right?

1029
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,970
So they got these strange
letters that said, hey,

1030
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,580
this company you never
heard of had a breach

1031
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,150
and so now your data's out there, right?

1032
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,150
And so when that happened
they came to my team,

1033
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,950
telecom team and said, all right,

1034
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,420
we're getting all these calls

1035
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,160
and they're coming into
all these different queues.

1036
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,410
Is there anything you can do with the,

1037
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,670
you know, say anything menu?

1038
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,630
No, no, no, no.

1039
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,730
That would take months. We'd send it off.

1040
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,366
We'd have a conversation with Nuance

1041
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,380
and we'd have to get a
compiled version back.

1042
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,730
There's no way. There's no way.

1043
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,880
So we, you know,

1044
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,650
eventually put in some, like,
hack into it where we could,

1045
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,280
you know, send certain
volumes of calls off,

1046
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,100
but we couldn't react, right?

1047
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,280
And not having the ability to react

1048
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,280
to present day events was a big use case.

1049
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,970
And we told them straight up,

1050
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,380
like, our system right
now isn't in a state

1051
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,393
where you can react like that.

1052
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,780
But there is this system
over here that you can.

1053
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,640
We've been looking at it.
- Right.

1054
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,753
- We really want it.

1055
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,270
So that was a big shift for,
for the business to say,

1056
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,660
aha, there is a reason that
we want this technology.

1057
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,493
So it's right.

1058
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:14,760
It's really, you know,

1059
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,170
both sides really do
want the same outcomes.

1060
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,820
They just don't talk the same language.

1061
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,000
- Was there a goal towards
driving the per unit cost

1062
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,230
of interaction down too?

1063
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,000
Was that a metric that
you guys were looking at?

1064
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I mean, there's always those
stats that are tracked.

1065
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,504
I don't think we drive 'em quite
as hard as other companies.

1066
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:40,020
- Okay.
- You know, 'cause it depends.

1067
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,660
I, you know, prior to Genworth,

1068
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,490
I worked at AOL, and boy,

1069
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,343
did we drive those metrics hard.

1070
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,000
You know, the only
calls you let go on long

1071
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,953
are the ones that retain customers.

1072
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,630
So, but for Genworth, it
really is about, you know,

1073
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,220
trying to solve customer's
problem on that first call.

1074
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,933
First call resolution's a big one.

1075
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,340
And, you know, we do average handle time,

1076
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,630
all those type of stats,

1077
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,750
but we don't drive them
quite as hard as others.

1078
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,820
- Cool. Wonderful.

1079
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,040
We'll talk, we've three minutes left

1080
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,210
and we have to be on time.

1081
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,100
So the leadership shift, right?

1082
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,270
We're seeing, you know,

1083
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,960
this going from obviously
the board and the C-suite.

1084
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,820
So leaders are treating this concept

1085
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,490
of agents and agentic AI,

1086
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,020
you know, as a capability

1087
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,750
that kind of rewires the
concept of how work gets done.

1088
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,400
I think it's really
important to think about

1089
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,190
how work gets done and how
work gets done with agents.

1090
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,023
And with agents,

1091
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:45,330
I mean these bounded systems
with context and perception

1092
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,240
and memory and these
multi-step capabilities

1093
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,440
with coordination of data.

1094
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,810
So really important in
the proper guardrail.

1095
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,180
So really important as
you go on this journey,

1096
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,620
redefine how work gets done.

1097
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,340
This agent and human
interaction becomes important.

1098
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,173
And, you know,

1099
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:02,490
these production workflows
with observability,

1100
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,490
I think the most interesting
thing, we sat down with the,

1101
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,140
one of the agent core leaders today,

1102
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,820
very focused on observability, right?

1103
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,680
Being able in a regulatory environment,

1104
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,120
being able to produce the why,

1105
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,333
so the input and the output and
how these agents interacted,

1106
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,071
that becomes critically important

1107
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:18,450
in any regulatory experience.

1108
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,660
But just as you're trying
to educate the masses

1109
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,050
and your leadership team as to
how you derive this outcome.

1110
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,510
But I think successful execution follows

1111
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,860
kind of this consistent pattern

1112
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,110
where organizations
start with high impact,

1113
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,670
low complexity use cases.

1114
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,010
They create the wins similar
to what Mark mentioned.

1115
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,130
They kind of codify that
into these reusable kits,

1116
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,900
prompts, guardrails, data hooks,

1117
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,820
and then they scale that vertically

1118
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,280
where kind of P&L impact concentrates.

1119
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,820
And that point isn't accumulating
proof of concepts, right?

1120
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,650
It's actually compounding the knowhow

1121
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,130
and building more and more
capability and outcomes.

1122
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,820
So I think that's really
important. We'll keep moving.

1123
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,100
We're gonna go to the end if that's okay.

1124
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,240
'Cause we have one minute.

1125
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,530
So I think key takeaways for us,

1126
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,420
so we believe, you know,

1127
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,400
this concept of the autonomous enterprise

1128
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,450
over the next five years,

1129
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,370
everyone who will have
some level of autonomy.

1130
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,470
So whether it's in sales conversions

1131
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,700
and what we're seeing in, you know,

1132
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,920
getting a point and a half increase,

1133
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,480
software development, productivity,

1134
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,950
there was some capabilities

1135
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,530
that were rolled out today
that I think are important.

1136
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,790
Software development life cycle,

1137
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,960
agent development life cycle.

1138
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,030
We're seeing about 35% improvement.

1139
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,530
But starting, ensuring that
you have the proper use cases.

1140
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,360
You have, you start with copilot,

1141
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,650
you think about single agent,

1142
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,720
you get towards this multi-agent.

1143
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,430
But as you start this journey

1144
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,800
of kind of multi-agent and agentic,

1145
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,900
really doing so thoughtfully,

1146
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,610
thinking with first principle, right?

1147
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,230
Taking kind of a step
back and understanding

1148
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,030
how you're gonna redefine
the enterprise end to end.

1149
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,310
So for us at Genpact,

1150
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,710
being a business operator for our clients,

1151
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,420
we have firsthand experience

1152
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,130
of what that last mile needs to be.

1153
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,260
So we can kind of
challenge the status quo.

1154
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,530
But what we've learned
is do it responsibly.

1155
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,080
Make sure you have the right
safeguards in place and,

1156
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,600
you know, over time
this kind of test learn

1157
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,990
and continue to accumulate
knowledge is compounding.

1158
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,190
And that compounding effect

1159
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,750
becomes really, really important.

1160
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,040
So with that, Mark,

1161
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,193
I'll leave it to you to maybe
give us the grand close.

1162
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:17,370
(Mark laughs)

1163
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,943
- Yeah, so again, you know,

1164
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:25,943
for your journey, set your North Star.

1165
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,820
Get your business leaders

1166
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,030
to support that journey with you.

1167
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,329
It's a partnership.

1168
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:37,650
And, you know,

1169
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:42,650
make sure that you have the
proper governance frameworks

1170
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:47,492
and, you know, the rest
will follow much easier

1171
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:50,190
after proper foundation is set up.

1172
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,720
- Awesome. Well, thank you.

1173
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,520
We appreciate everybody sitting in.

1174
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,990
Hopefully you were in the right spot.

1175
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,390
So you learned a little bit
around kind of Mark's journey

1176
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,730
and what we're seeing in the marketplace.

1177
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,500
Come see us at our happy
hour at six o'clock

1178
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,150
at Trattoria Reggiano.

1179
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,740
So thanks, and I hope
everybody has a great show.

1180
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,990
(audience applauding)
