  "abstract": "Enterprises across industries—including regulated sectors like banking—are eager to realize AI’s promise, from insights to automation. Yet fragmented data, rigid governance, and the cost of innovation often create frustration. This session explores a bold shift: the business—not IT—will lead AI innovation. Success requires empowering teams to ideate freely, experiment rapidly, and unlock value at market pace. We’ll show how a modern data product strategy delivers access, trust, and agility while meeting governance needs. You’ll learn why experimentation is today’s strategic advantage and how to turn business curiosity into measurable competitive impact. This presentation is brought to you by Starburst, an AWS Partner.",
