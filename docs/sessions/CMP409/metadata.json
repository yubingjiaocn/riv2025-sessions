  "abstract": "Keeping track of the order of events in distributed systems is one of the most fundamental and important problems in computer science. In 2023, we improved the Amazon Time Sync Service to microsecond-level clock accuracy so we, and our customers, can use wall-clock time in applications including databases, AI/ML, financial services, broadcast/media, telecommunications, and more to improve both the performance and resiliency of our systems and applications. We will be sharing how with real-world examples of AWS services now leveraging this capability, and Nasdaq will be sharing how they are using precision time to build their next generation cloud applications.",
