1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,550
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,160
Good afternoon and thanks
for joining us today.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,590
Welcome to SAS 305:

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,050
Using GenAI to profile, scale,

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,053
and optimize your multi-tenant
SaaS architecture.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,100
So in this session today,
we're going to look at

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,780
how you can fast-track your
SaaS maturity using GenAI

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,330
to introduce best-of-breed SaaS attributes

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,773
into your SaaS product.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,030
Now, this is a level 300 session.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,863
What that means is

12
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:34,770
we're not going to be
diving into demos and code,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,470
but we will be doing a lot
of architecture patterns

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,240
and showing you real-world use cases

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,733
that you can take away and use yourself.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,580
My name is Dave Roberts,

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,980
and with my colleague, Damika Sriyananda,

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,620
we're both solutions
architects here at AWS,

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,090
and we've been working with SaaS

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,860
for the last couple of years,

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,073
and in the recent year or
two with GenAI as well.

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,063
So what are we going to look at today?

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,640
Well, first I'm going to look at

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,650
what makes best-of-breed SaaS

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,300
and how you can use GenAI

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,063
to incorporate some of that
into your control plane.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,930
Then Damika is gonna
look at cost analysis,

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,803
so things like cost per
tenant, pricing, forecasting.

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,310
Then I'm going to look
into customer behavior,

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,380
the insights that we can get out of those,

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,640
customer personas, packaging,
that sort of thing.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,740
And finally, Damika is gonna round us out

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,230
with looking into resource efficiency,

34
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,130
so solving the noisy neighbor problem.

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,450
So let's start off and look
at a very common situation.

36
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,640
You've just built your SaaS application.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,473
It's awesome, right?

38
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:45,480
You're proud of it, you've
put a lot of work into that,

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,820
and you've got customers using it.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,530
And to operate that, to manage that,

41
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,590
you've got some business
model going on as well.

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,423
Cool.

43
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,330
It's been a couple of years

44
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,890
and hopefully you're getting some revenue

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,080
and making some money.

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,040
And where you want to go from
here is to grow your SaaS.

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,940
So the question is,

48
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,220
what do you need to do to grow your SaaS?

49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,490
Well, there's three main
areas that we can look at.

50
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,520
One, we can get more customers, right?

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,560
More customers equals more revenue,

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,810
more revenue equals more profit.

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,713
Great stuff.

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,593
The other way

55
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:21,240
is that we can look at getting
more revenue per customer.

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,840
So moving customers onto
higher margin packages,

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,490
that's gonna give us more profit.

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,253
And of course,

59
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:30,720
the other way is to lower
our operating costs,

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,633
so get more resource
efficiency into there.

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
So these are the things
that we need to do,

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
but how are we going to do it?

63
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,730
Well, let's look at
best-of-breed SaaS vendors

64
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,783
and what they do.

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,510
And when we talk about best-of-breed,

66
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,670
we're talking about those SaaS
vendors out in the market,

67
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,410
you probably know them.

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,290
They're standing above
their competitors, right?

69
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,123
You can see them

70
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,290
and they always seem to be one step ahead

71
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,673
and keep pulling forward.

72
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,710
So what's their secret?

73
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,240
Well, it's not really a
secret, it's they use data,

74
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,810
so they know the cost to
serve their customers.

75
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,520
They've got things like cost per tenant,

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,250
cost per feature metrics,

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,680
and they understand what
their customers are doing.

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,293
They've got insights into
their customer behavior.

79
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,060
And of course they focus on
their resource efficiency

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,960
because when you first go
live with a SaaS product,

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,350
you are focused more on
just getting it going live,

82
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,760
getting products going,

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,957
and you're not really
thinking about building

84
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:34,590
the most efficient architecture.

85
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, the problem with that

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,010
is that you get some resource wastage,

87
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,540
and as you scale your SaaS,

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,570
that resource wastage scales as well.

89
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,620
So best-of-breed knows this
and they focus in on efficiency

90
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,343
because those efficiency gains
are going to scale as well.

91
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,540
And this will give them the edge

92
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,030
because they're able to use this data

93
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,970
to create packages and pricing

94
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,190
that the customers are
going to want, right?

95
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,740
Because if you are choosing a SaaS product

96
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,300
and you've got a couple of competitors

97
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,880
and one of them has exactly what you want

98
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,200
at a price that's fit for you,

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
well, that's the one
you're going to choose.

100
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,330
And because they've got these insights,

101
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,320
because they have this data,

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,790
they're able to forecast the revenue

103
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,190
that's going to be coming in, right?

104
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,190
That's pretty useful as a SaaS business.

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,740
And because they're
ultimately more profitable,

106
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,620
they have more profit to
reinvest in themselves.

107
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,630
So you get this nice cycle, right?

108
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,070
They have more profit to reinvest,

109
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,803
they can pull further
ahead, and so on and so on.

110
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,310
So if it's so simple, Dave,

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,780
why aren't you doing this right now?

112
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,440
Well, odds are

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
that you probably have
other things to do, right?

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
You've gone live with your SaaS,

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,670
you are onboarding new customers,

116
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,800
you're adding new features in.

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,200
You started off as an architect, right?

118
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
Then you turned into DevOps

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
as you've got the customers going on,

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,740
more and more customers.

121
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,573
Now you're just ops,

122
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,290
you're not even doing
architecture anymore.

123
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,970
So nobody's got time

124
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,823
to think about implementing
these sort of features.

125
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
And engineering will think

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,230
this is a business problem, right?

127
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,060
So until we have some business people,

128
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,700
until your SaaS company scales

129
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,280
that you have these business
functions pushing engineering

130
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,870
to deliver them,

131
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,370
you're going to focus on
what's important for you.

132
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,840
And ultimately, there's
a cost to doing this.

133
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,820
There's a cost in terms
of engineering points,

134
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,370
there's a cost in terms of your time.

135
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,240
So it gets put onto the back burner

136
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,190
until you reach a level of SaaS maturity

137
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,713
and then start incorporating
these features.

138
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,440
Now the problem with this is
that as you operate your SaaS,

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
you have to make decisions.

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,620
And at the moment,

141
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,440
you'd be making decisions
without this data.

142
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,750
So you are already behind on the game

143
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,490
because your competitors

144
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,980
could potentially have these insights.

145
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,820
If your competitors understand
what the customer base wants,

146
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,470
well, you are behind in the game.

147
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,890
And even more dangerous,

148
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,260
you may have unprofitable customers.

149
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,410
It's a common scenario that
I see with SaaS vendors

150
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,180
where they've been going for three years,

151
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,430
they start looking into
their cost per tenant,

152
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,260
they find out they've got these customers

153
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,620
that are unprofitable, they
are hurting their bottom line.

154
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,633
It's not a place that you want to be in.

155
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,930
Now, lots of doom and gloom, right?

156
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,640
But there is a light at
the end of the tunnel

157
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,260
and that's why you're here today, right?

158
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,240
This is what the session is about.

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,930
Because GenAI can really
help in this regard.

160
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,160
Because all these things,

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,383
these data that we are talking about,

162
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:39,510
it's all about looking into our data

163
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,540
and finding patterns and finding insights.

164
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,373
And guess what?

165
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,930
This is exactly how LLMs work.

166
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,913
They're great for identifying patterns.

167
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,310
And not only that,

168
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,340
you can use them to get
some value really quickly.

169
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,440
You can get an environment going up,

170
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,210
look into the data you have,

171
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,400
and get some insights in an afternoon.

172
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,780
This is really awesome, right?

173
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,160
You don't have to take months

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,500
to build up this environment,

175
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,330
straight away you've got some value.

176
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,163
Or not.

177
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,680
And if you don't, find something else.

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,350
And you get this lovely
natural interface, right?

179
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,070
You can use natural language
to query for these insights,

180
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,550
you don't have to be this
intermediate translation

181
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,823
from business question
into technical requirement.

182
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,060
And it also gives us the opportunity

183
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,570
to move beyond just solving
these normal use cases

184
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,750
and looking at what we can do
beyond what's currently now,

185
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,993
so things like real-time
or predictive analysis.

186
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,180
So let's look at an example
SaaS application, right?

187
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,340
You've got your application plan there.

188
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,050
This is where all the good
stuff's going on, right?

189
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,420
The customers are getting their value.

190
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,160
And this is going to scale over time

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,920
and you're going to need
to operate and manage that.

192
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,160
So you're going to
introduce a control plane.

193
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,220
And inside the control plane,
we've got a few components.

194
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,720
We've got some data sets,

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,290
so our application metrics,
for example, our usage metrics.

196
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,965
We've got a data set which will
handle our tenant metadata,

197
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,240
and we're gonna talk
about tenant metadatas,

198
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,300
information about our
tenants, about our customers,

199
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,550
like which resources
are they allocated to,

200
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,453
what sort of entitlements do
they have, that sort of thing.

201
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,940
And to do all of our heavy lifting,

202
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,770
we have some compute logic, right?

203
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,030
These are our workflows.

204
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,710
So onboarding new customer,

205
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,030
this is where it's going to happen,

206
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,930
change an entitlement, update
our resources, et cetera.

207
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,250
And to interface with these,

208
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,410
we've got this lovely integration layer.

209
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,260
And we can see that we
have a lot of tools,

210
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,713
a lot of resources that
an agent could utilize.

211
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,093
So what would this look
like as an example?

212
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,080
Well, let's say you are inspired.

213
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,580
You come and you do the session,

214
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,500
you're excited about this and you rush,

215
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,670
don't even think about dinner,

216
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,950
you just rush back to your hotel room

217
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,850
and you wanna start playing.

218
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,060
So you get up your nice Kiro environment,

219
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,460
get onto the AWS lab site and see,

220
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,910
hey, we have this CloudWatch MCP server.

221
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,170
All my logs are in CloudWatch,
I'm going to use that.

222
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,380
I'm gonna go ask some question, right?

223
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,790
So all my tenants have
that same usage pattern.

224
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,740
That could be interesting.

225
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,840
So our little LLM friend

226
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,480
is going to go and use their MCP server

227
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,060
and hopefully look in the right place.

228
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,470
And I say hopefully

229
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,850
because your SaaS architecture
is probably pretty complex

230
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,100
and it's hard enough for us to understand,

231
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,290
let alone an agent.

232
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,590
So we can expose the code
base and look into there

233
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,690
and find how you've
done your architecture,

234
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,950
but it doesn't really tell that much

235
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,800
about how you operate as a business.

236
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,970
So we want to be kind to
our future robotic overlords

237
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,410
and give it a bit of context,

238
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,973
tell it a bit about how
our SaaS application works.

239
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,030
Because the better context
you're going to provide,

240
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,760
the better results that
you're going to get.

241
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,910
So now we add that context,
ask that same question,

242
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,190
beep-boop-beep, we get a result.

243
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,120
This is really cool,

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,250
we should be able to see some insights

245
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,443
that potentially we didn't have before.

246
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,220
And you're saying, well,
this is great, right?

247
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,340
It didn't take me long

248
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,380
and I'm getting some value out of this.

249
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,580
So where can I go from this?

250
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,220
Well, we can go back to AWS Labs and say,

251
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,010
hey, what other MCP servers do we have?

252
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,350
There's one for Cost Explorer.

253
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,180
Well, that's interesting.

254
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,380
Now I know I have got a
resource to look into the usage

255
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,150
of my customers,

256
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,450
I know how to find the
costs for serving that,

257
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,970
let's find out our cost per tenant.

258
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,803
So we can say,

259
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,400
hey, let's just divide that total cost

260
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,620
by the number of active tenants.

261
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,050
And boom, just like that,
we've got some data,

262
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,973
some insights about cost per tenant.

263
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,060
And I talk constantly with customers

264
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,390
who have been serving their SaaS for years

265
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,250
and they don't have an idea
about the cost per tenant

266
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,660
because it seems so hard.

267
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,030
Well, we've done it in less than an hour.

268
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,260
Easy, right?

269
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,450
And the thing is, it's not perfect,

270
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,513
but now you've got some
figure that you can work with.

271
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,380
And we can look at improving
the accuracy, right?

272
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,550
Because at the moment,

273
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,130
we're just looking at the
number of active tenants

274
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,180
that we have.

275
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,890
Maybe we have some inactive tenants,

276
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,713
that's going to change our
cost per tenant values.

277
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,250
And we have information
on the number of tenants

278
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,050
that we have and their subscriptions,

279
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,210
it's sitting there in our tenant metadata.

280
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,400
We just need a way to expose that

281
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,293
so that our agent can use that.

282
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,130
So we can go and extend
our integration layer,

283
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,390
add some MCP servers there,
and add these into our agent,

284
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,503
and now we can get a more
accurate cost per tenant, right?

285
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,560
And this is awesome, and all we had to do

286
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,770
is expose the control plane a little bit.

287
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,100
And that's really not so
hard because for example,

288
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,750
look at our tenant management.

289
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,510
This is the tenant management service

290
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,010
inside our control plane,

291
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,980
we can see our CRUD operations there,

292
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,650
or to expose these as MCP servers,

293
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,990
we can use something
like AgentCore Gateway.

294
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,000
Makes it really easy, right?

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,220
We create this tenant management gateway

296
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,310
and add some targets
through to our API methods

297
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,783
that we want to expose.

298
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,330
And we can repeat this pattern

299
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,670
with our other control plane capabilities.

300
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,790
So resource management,
entitlement management, billing,

301
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,033
anything that could be useful
for us to get insights into.

302
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,080
And once we've done this
little proof of concept

303
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,883
and seeing that we're
getting some insights

304
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,740
that are valuable for us,

305
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,260
either as architects or as a business,

306
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,300
then we can decide that
we want to keep this

307
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,640
and make this a permanent capability

308
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,143
inside our control plane.

309
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,140
So one option is that we could just lift

310
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,730
and shift what we have and deploy that,

311
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,780
now the other is that we
could make it a bit better,

312
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,510
a bit more accurate.

313
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,750
So we want to think about some
sort of architecture pattern

314
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,583
that we can use

315
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,540
because we are going to
be deploying these things

316
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,510
over and over as we
get these new insights.

317
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,600
And it's basically going
to look like this, right?

318
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,820
We're going to have the agent itself,

319
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,460
we're going to have some
deterministic tools,

320
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,130
because if you want to do X divided by Y,

321
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,200
well, create a Lambda, right?

322
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,990
It's easier, cheaper than
getting an agent to do it,

323
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,223
and it's reliable.

324
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,430
We're going to have a
data set or data sets.

325
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,110
This is going to be the results

326
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,950
from anything that we are
deriving in terms of insights.

327
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,760
And some sort of gateway to
expose those for our end users

328
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,383
or other agents.

329
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,750
And for example,

330
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,140
we might have a
deterministic tool that says,

331
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,120
well, every night, I'm gonna go off,

332
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm gonna look through our
metrics, aggregate some results,

333
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,130
and put them into our data set.

334
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,890
Now I can expose that to our end users,

335
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,270
nice simple web interface

336
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,993
or maybe some BI tool,
Amazon QuickSee type-thing,

337
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,630
awesome stuff.

338
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,520
Now our end users, our business,

339
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,940
are able to see the insights
that we've garnered.

340
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,060
We can also expose that
to some other agent,

341
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,520
and some other agent can then
come through the gateway,

342
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,340
through some MCP server
that we've exposed,

343
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,410
and they can access that data.

344
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,380
So we can see as we've
created this capability,

345
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,010
we're also able to share those
insights to have a data set

346
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,230
that another capability could utilize

347
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,273
to get even further insights.

348
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,150
And we can do a similar pattern

349
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,880
when we talk about invoking the agent.

350
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,210
So we can provide a
natural language interface

351
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,400
for our business to query,

352
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,680
or we could expose that
to some other agent,

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,670
and this is awesome.

354
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,010
And then our agent can use its own tools

355
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,580
or some external tools
to go and do its thing.

356
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,100
So we can see by having this nice pattern,

357
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,720
it lets us be modular

358
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,570
and scale out our insights more and more

359
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,140
so we can get more and more
information about that.

360
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,720
And this is a nice pattern,
you're creating value,

361
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,870
and you're creating more
value and more value.

362
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,920
And to give some examples
of how this would look

363
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,070
in another context,

364
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,740
I'd like to pass back
to my colleague, Damika,

365
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,473
who's going to look into cost analysis.

366
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,660
- Awesome, thanks Dave.

367
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,800
Hey, everybody, welcome
again to the session.

368
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
Now that you have a better perspective

369
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,670
about how GenAI capabilities
can be leveraged

370
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,900
in SaaS applications,

371
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,460
let's take a look at some of the examples

372
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,560
starting from the cost analysis.

373
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,460
Now, in general,

374
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,070
cost analysis starts with instrumenting

375
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,910
the application plane

376
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,700
to meet the consumption
matrix of the tenants

377
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,310
so that we can aggregate
them in the control plane

378
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,850
to get the infrastructure
cost per tenant attribution.

379
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,520
And that helped us to
understand the tenants

380
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,680
who are not making so much
of a profit in the business

381
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,260
so that we could do something about that.

382
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,750
Traditionally, this is
where we all got settled

383
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,580
in most of the SaaS applications

384
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,980
in terms of the cost analysis.

385
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,370
Now, GenAI fundamentally
changes the situation

386
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,170
where while it can provide the automation

387
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,310
for the cost analysis,

388
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,500
it can also provide the access

389
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,600
to advanced cost intelligence much easily.

390
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,200
Now, before getting
into the cost analysis,

391
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,660
our story still starts with the
cost per tenant attribution.

392
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,830
Now, Dave will explain how we
can get some of the quick wins

393
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,070
by leveraging GenAI tooling
in the cost per tenant,

394
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,940
but here we will see

395
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,460
how we can make it more permanent design

396
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,260
in the control plane architecture

397
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,300
by using GenAI technologies.

398
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,710
Now in the control plane,

399
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,420
we already got the consumption matrix

400
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,940
and the logs from the tenants.

401
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,210
And now instead of having
hard-coded cost allocation rules

402
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,800
and bulky microservices,

403
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,360
we are gonna introduce an
AI agent for the picture.

404
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,120
And that agent can be
triggered using a prompt,

405
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,660
and that will be kind of
orchestrating the entire workflow

406
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,670
of the cost per tenant attribution

407
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,830
by using the reasoning capabilities

408
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,830
of using the large language model.

409
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,060
Now, during the workflow,

410
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,280
it'll look at the current
usage of the tenants

411
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,290
and then aggregate the matrix out of that

412
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,990
so that it'll know the
list of AWS services

413
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,720
that has contributed to the cost,

414
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,980
and then work with the
Cost Explorer MCP server

415
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,350
to get the unit cost of these matrices

416
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,840
so it can calculate the
cost per tenant accurately.

417
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,610
Now, whenever you are building this

418
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,850
for your SaaS application,
you will feel that,

419
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,340
hey, we need more tools,
more steps in the workflow,

420
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,510
that's totally fine.

421
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,480
The agent will be able to
orchestrate them all for you.

422
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,740
Now, when I know the cost per tenant,

423
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,290
I can easily get the margin
value as well in the same time,

424
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,383
and that's great because
now I can have the cost

425
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:38,910
and the margin both in the same data set

426
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,110
and then save in the control
plane for the future use.

427
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,250
Now this is gonna be the base

428
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,353
for our cost analysis architecture.

429
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,360
Now, if you look at where the
cost analysis implementation

430
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,150
really get fit into the
control plane architecture,

431
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,860
there are multiple ways of doing that.

432
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,000
One of the ways to think is
to extend the SaaS admin panel

433
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,630
and introducing a cost analysis dashboard

434
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,780
so that we can populate the insights,

435
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,280
the patterns, and the recommendations

436
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,310
we are extracting from the
cost analysis module in there

437
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,430
so that the SaaS admins will
have the access to them.

438
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,483
So with that setup,

439
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,683
we already have

440
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:21,510
the historical cost
standard margin data set,

441
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,690
came from the previous agentic workflow.

442
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,990
Probably one of the low-hanging
fruits for us to start with

443
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,740
is to look at this data set

444
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,050
and identify the insights and the pattern,

445
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,470
so me as a SaaS provider,
I have a better perspective

446
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,690
about what happened
during the last few months

447
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,480
in terms of cost and the margin.

448
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,600
So for that, we'll have a
cost insight agent here.

449
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
Very simple workflow it has.

450
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,863
It'll look at the last
12 months of the cost

451
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:50,863
and the margin data set,
and then leverage the LLM

452
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,430
and ask for the insights and the patterns.

453
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,200
There's no business logic in here,

454
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,230
just the power of the LLM.

455
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,450
So during this analysis, I can
ask for things like trends,

456
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,500
margin variations, and temporal
and the behavioral patterns.

457
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,660
And this can be entirely customizable

458
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,630
because this is what will go
to the prompt that we send

459
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,343
to the AI agent.

460
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Now, the results of that would
be very much data-driven,

461
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,880
deep insights that will
show me how the margin

462
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,120
and the cost has been wearing
over the last 12 months.

463
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,953
This is awesome

464
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,060
because now I can even understand
some of the opportunities

465
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,950
that I could have done better

466
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,750
to improve my profit margin as well.

467
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,840
Now, another feature that we
can add to the cost analysis

468
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,023
is cost forecasting.

469
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,210
The idea is simple.

470
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,590
You look at the historical data

471
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,020
and then predict the future values, right?

472
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,380
So for that, we are gonna
have a cost prediction agent.

473
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,770
It will look at pretty
much the same data data set

474
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,920
in this example,

475
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,620
like previously the last 12 months data

476
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,060
of the cost and the margin,

477
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,280
and then do the prediction
for the next six months.

478
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,170
Now, as a SaaS provider,

479
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,030
I really want to have this prediction

480
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,030
as accurate as possible
so that I can use them

481
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,463
with a high confidence for my, let's say,

482
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,619
business decision-making
and things like that.

483
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,370
So in order to do that,

484
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,090
I can either go for a library
or a business logic of my own

485
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,690
that will give me the
accurate prediction as well.

486
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,600
Or I can plan to deploy this agent

487
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,540
in the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime,

488
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,230
and then let it know what
kind of prediction algorithm

489
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,000
and the simulation I wanna have.

490
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So the agent will be able to
generate the code using the LLM

491
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,050
and then run that within
the agent code interpreter

492
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,990
so that it will provide
the prediction data set.

493
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,460
So in that case, I'm not even
managing that business logic,

494
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,403
that will be literally
generated by the agent for me.

495
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,730
So likewise, there are many options

496
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,890
with the agentic setup like that.

497
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,590
So when you got the predicted data set,

498
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,150
you're gonna save that for the future use,

499
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,220
and then it'll leverage the LLM,

500
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,100
asking for the insights and the patterns.

501
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,570
Now, during this predictive analysis,

502
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,780
I can ask for things
like forecasting trends,

503
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,540
growth patterns, and the cost
and the margin variations.

504
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,000
Now I have a better perspective
about what's gonna happen

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,380
in the next six months

506
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,470
in terms of the SaaS economics as well.

507
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,303
Which is awesome,

508
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:28,320
now we can actually get
credit for the business

509
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,793
in different forms.

510
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,673
Now, this is great.

511
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:35,010
I only had the cost per
tenant value sometime ago,

512
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,770
and now with the help of couple of agents,

513
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,530
I now have the historical patterns

514
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,453
and the predictive analysis as well.

515
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,010
Now, before moving ahead,

516
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,540
we want to improve our architecture

517
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,430
because so far we have been discussing

518
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,580
what individual agents
can offer to us, right?

519
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,790
So if you put them all together
into a SaaS architecture,

520
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,610
it's important to look at
how they work each other

521
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,740
as an extendable design.

522
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,760
So here we got the insight

523
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,610
and the prediction agents
that we discussed before.

524
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,590
So one of the changes I would do here

525
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,600
is to introduce the supervisor agent.

526
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,570
So it'll kind of orchestrate
these two agentic workflow

527
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,300
and anything that is
coming up down the line

528
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,340
to extract the response

529
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,170
for the prompts coming from the front end,

530
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,003
in this case, the inside dashboard.

531
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,580
And also as a technical decision,

532
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,510
probably I'll have the cost
per tenant workflow separately

533
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,050
so that I can individually
trigger that when I want

534
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,360
to get the latest cost
and the margin values

535
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,510
into the control plane.

536
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,650
Now with that setup,
it's really interesting

537
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,650
to look at another area
that is AI recommendation.

538
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,080
Can an agent provide
me some recommendations

539
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,530
to optimize the resource utilization

540
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,333
to maximize my margin, for example.

541
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,310
To check out that,

542
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,220
we'll introduce a resource
optimization agent here,

543
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,990
and then I'll provide all the knowledge

544
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,810
about the infrastructure of the system

545
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,810
and the tenant usage of the
infrastructure, that dataset,

546
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,620
as well as a preloaded knowledge

547
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,200
for this agent, so it's
already configured.

548
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,290
And then when that agentic workflow

549
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,080
we got triggered from
the supervisor agent,

550
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,170
so this agent can leverage its own LLM,

551
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,860
now also with the historical
and the forecasted cost

552
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,460
and the margin data set as well,

553
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
and asking for the recommendation

554
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,040
for critical infrastructure
changes I need to do

555
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,723
to maximize my profit margin.

556
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,633
Now this is awesome.

557
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,680
Now there's an agent telling me

558
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,380
what are the things I can consider

559
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,810
in terms of the infrastructure changes

560
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,403
to maximize my profit as well.

561
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
Now, if your main focus here

562
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,980
is to improve your profit
margin in your business,

563
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,130
which is in every SaaS application,

564
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,570
this is just one side of the story,

565
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,650
optimizing the infrastructure.

566
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,510
The other side would be the tier pricing,

567
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,030
you've got to have the tier
pricing optimized as well.

568
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,890
But if you look at our architecture,

569
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,320
there's one important
dimension that is missing

570
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
to have recommendations for tier pricing,

571
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,210
that is the unit cost for the features,

572
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,620
that stands for the average
infrastructure cost required

573
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,593
to host each and every
feature in the architecture.

574
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,270
Why it is important?

575
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,150
Because most, like often,
most of our SaaS applications

576
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,550
are driven by product features

577
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,650
and then we categorize
or group these features

578
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,130
into different tiers, and
we provide a pricing value.

579
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,150
Because of that,

580
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,760
the unit cost of the feature
will have a direct impact

581
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,230
to the tier pricing.

582
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,490
But how can we get it?

583
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,290
It's actually simpler than we think.

584
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,420
We already have the consumption matrix

585
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,620
in the application plane

586
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,230
that have been metered by the tenant ID.

587
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,840
All now what we need to do
is to identify the features

588
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,500
and their workflows along
the architectural components,

589
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,550
and then inject the right feature ID

590
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,700
to the consumption matrix
based on the feature workflow.

591
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,570
That's it.

592
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,060
And then send them onto the control plane.

593
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,920
And in the control plane,

594
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,670
I'm gonna aggregate the
matrix by the feature ID now

595
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,100
and then calculate the
cost, get an average,

596
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,600
and then I will get the
cost per feature data set.

597
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,010
Now I can talk about the
new pricing strategy agent

598
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,960
that we are gonna
introduce into the picture.

599
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,150
So this will give us the recommendations

600
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,800
to optimize the pricing strategy.

601
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,280
For that, I will provide all the knowledge

602
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,460
about the current tiering strategy,

603
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,730
packaging structure, and
the cost into this agent.

604
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,980
And then when it get triggers,

605
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,450
it'll ask for the recommendation.

606
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,620
And now it has a rich set of data sets

607
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,860
to bring in for getting
those recommendations

608
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,810
such as all the cost
of the margin data set

609
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,883
and the new cost per feature as well.

610
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,130
Because of that,

611
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,490
these recommendations
are really comprehensive.

612
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,920
It can come in terms of
the pricing adjustments

613
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,500
where the agent will tell you exactly

614
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,130
what other prices has to be
changed to maximize the profit.

615
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,990
It could be packaging recommendations

616
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,480
where it'll tell you what
should be the list of features

617
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,440
that each and every tier should
have to maximize the margin,

618
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,900
even the new tier opportunities

619
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,030
where we can introduce a new tier,

620
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,470
what is the price of that?

621
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,833
What should be the list of
features that it has as well?

622
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:32,445
Now I can start optimizing
the pricing strategy as well.

623
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,990
So if you look at our cost
analysis architecture,

624
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,823
the right-hand side,

625
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:40,860
you've got a nice agentic
workflow that is growing,

626
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,350
we can keep on adding new capabilities.

627
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,990
You've got the supervisor
agent orchestrating them all,

628
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,100
and then extracting the
response for the prompts

629
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,570
coming from the front end,

630
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,490
which is the dashboard in this case.

631
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,840
And like easy feature that
we can actually implement

632
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,170
in here is, of course, the
natural language interface.

633
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,020
So now that SaaS admins are not limited

634
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,210
by what has been shown in the dashboard,

635
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,310
they can even have a conversation

636
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,230
or interaction with the agentic workflow

637
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,210
and get to know more about the insights

638
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,400
and the recommendations as well.

639
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,237
Now, whenever you are building this

640
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:17,490
for your SaaS application,
I have two recommendations.

641
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,420
Number one, you don't have to
start with everything, right?

642
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,610
Start small but have
extendable architecture

643
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,120
so that you can keep on adding
new features, new agents,

644
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,050
without being worried

645
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,630
about how do you integrate
that to SaaS architecture.

646
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,910
And then work backwards from
your business requirements

647
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,550
so that you know what you
need from the front end,

648
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,430
whether it's a dashboard or
a AI bot or something else

649
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,150
so that you can prioritize
the relevant agentic workflow

650
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,500
at the backend.

651
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,720
I hope this will help you to start off

652
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,633
with your cost analysis workflow
in your SaaS application.

653
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,720
So like cost analysis,

654
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,510
customer insights takes high
priority in SaaS application

655
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,700
where GenAI can help a lot as well.

656
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,100
To talk about that, let
me turn it back to Dave.

657
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:02,314
- Awesome.

658
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,140
Awesome, thanks Damika.

659
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,700
So customer insights, knowing
what your customers are doing,

660
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,400
it was one of the big
promises of SaaS, right?

661
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,750
You were all on-premise,

662
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,220
you didn't know what your
customers were doing,

663
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,820
well, let's operate and manage
this on our own environment

664
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,670
and we're gonna get insights
into our customer behavior,

665
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,040
we're gonna understand what they're doing.

666
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,660
Awesome, let's do it.

667
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,470
Now, the reality is, I see
this with a lot of customers,

668
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,620
is they're not getting
these insights, right?

669
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,420
And this is a bad place to be

670
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,723
because our customer insights
are really important.

671
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,420
And why are they so important?

672
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,720
Well, basically, they
grow our SaaS, right?

673
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,710
Because if we know what
customers are using,

674
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,110
well, we can spend our engineering points

675
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,513
and make our strengths even stronger.

676
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,600
And something that I've
seen more than once

677
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,700
is where we have a customer

678
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,130
starting to look into their insights

679
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,320
to find out what their
customers are using,

680
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,560
and they find that their
customer base are using features

681
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,540
which aren't really the core product.

682
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,190
And so they decide to pivot

683
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,190
and focus in those
aspects of their product

684
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,240
and they become more successful that way.

685
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,580
And the other side is, it
lets you sell in the way

686
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,680
that customers want to consume, right?

687
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,820
Because if I'm going out there

688
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,020
and I'm looking for SaaS products,

689
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,480
well, I'm gonna choose the
one that has the package

690
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,380
and the pricing that relates
to what I want to use.

691
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,870
And you can use this packaging and pricing

692
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,330
to create these conversion
journeys as well.

693
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,480
So creating a way to get
someone from a basic tier

694
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,430
that gets value from your core product

695
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,463
into a more premium tier
with higher margins.

696
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,690
So we can explore customer behavior

697
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,480
if we go back into our
nice Kiro environment

698
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,760
with some context like we had before,

699
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,160
or we can ask some basic questions, right?

700
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,150
Do we have different customer
personas based on our usage?

701
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,150
And our little LLM friend
is going to do his thing,

702
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,300
beep-boop-beep, and give us some data.

703
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,240
And these insights could be useful, right?

704
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,980
For example, we can see here

705
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,490
that we've got a bunch of
customers here with low usage.

706
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,500
Now that could be
interesting for our business

707
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,440
because those customers
could potentially leave.

708
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,400
We don't want that, right?

709
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,830
We don't want to lose the revenue.

710
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,730
And on the other side,

711
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,180
we've got a bunch of
customers with high usage,

712
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,150
also an interesting thing
from a business perspective

713
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,490
because these customers could be moved

714
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,193
into a higher paying,
more performant tier.

715
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,720
So we'd like to get a few
more insights into this,

716
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,400
but we need to add some more dimensions,

717
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
we need to look into feature usage, right?

718
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,040
What features are the customers using?

719
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,870
So we come up with a problem of,

720
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,033
where do we get that feature usage from?

721
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,170
And a common conversation
I've had with SaaS vendors

722
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,860
is that they're going down
and looking into feature usage

723
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,820
but they think that

724
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,710
they have to instrument
their whole application.

725
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,300
And this becomes this roadblock, right?

726
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,787
It's a lots of instrument,
you never get data out,

727
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:05,490
and when you do, it's incomplete views.

728
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,560
But it doesn't have to be so hard, right?

729
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,700
Because we're building our
applications on the cloud, right?

730
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,400
And you need some sort of way
to access your application,

731
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,080
and this ingress is the perfect
place to take feature usage.

732
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,020
So let's say for example,
if I'm using an API,

733
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,580
well, most of our APIs are
gonna have some opportunities

734
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,380
for access logs,

735
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,920
and most likely each feature
is gonna have their own path.

736
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,660
So we can use a path per feature

737
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,600
as a way to get feature usage dimensions.

738
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,280
Boom, nice and easy, right?

739
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,630
Didn't take any time at all

740
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,900
and now we're getting insights
into our feature usage.

741
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,200
And we can get more
granularity this way as well

742
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,910
because our operations
within that service feature

743
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,180
are probably gonna be different
based on the HTTP method.

744
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,520
So we can use this as another method

745
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,350
of getting some more granularity in there.

746
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,250
And straight away,

747
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,950
we're getting a lot of
insights into feature usage

748
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,143
and didn't really have to do much there.

749
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,830
Now, this doesn't apply to every use case.

750
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,940
Maybe your product

751
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,420
is taking millions of
requests per minute or second

752
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,717
and you don't really want
to turn on those access logs

753
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:17,430
'cause your bill is going to explode.

754
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,290
So then you need to look at

755
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,260
actually instrumenting your code.

756
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,530
Now this is going to give us
a bit more complexity, right?

757
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,930
Because we actually have
to go into our application,

758
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,010
touch the code.

759
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,710
And if you've got multiple feature teams,

760
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,670
you have to think about

761
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,627
how you're going to standardize
across the teams, right?

762
00:32:35,627 --> 00:32:37,710
'Cause you want some
sort of standardization

763
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,743
because standardization scales, SaaS.

764
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,260
But the benefit to this

765
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,200
is that you're able to get
much richer insights, right?

766
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,930
Because you can instrument
for the dimensions

767
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,620
and the metrics that are
relevant for your business.

768
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,630
So we have to think about that trade off

769
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,300
and balancing that
higher engineering costs

770
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,893
with these deeper insights.

771
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,670
And there's a place for
both approaches, right?

772
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,920
And my general advice is to say,

773
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,620
start off by getting that feature usage

774
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,200
with your ingress logs, right?

775
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,280
Get some data on the table,

776
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,920
stuff that you can work
with straight away.

777
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,840
And then when you need deeper insights

778
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,860
into particular areas,

779
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,613
then start instrumenting your
application code from there.

780
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,790
So now we know how to get feature usage,

781
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,900
let's add that as some context
for our little agent friend.

782
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,730
And now we can ask some questions, right?

783
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,950
What features are my customer's using?

784
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,820
Does its thing, beep-boop-beep,
and gives us some results.

785
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,310
And because it's a natural
language interface,

786
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,200
we can follow this up, right?

787
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,780
We can say, well, based
on that feature usage,

788
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,613
do we see some different personas?

789
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,200
Because customer personas
are really strong.

790
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,960
And when we talk about customer personas,

791
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,860
what we mean is

792
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,590
it's just a group or a
subset of our customers

793
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,170
that we can market to because
they have similar attributes,

794
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,303
they use our product in a similar way.

795
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,570
Because it would be nice

796
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,970
if all of our customers were the same,

797
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,120
but just like the real world,
customers are different

798
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,410
so we need to find out

799
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,753
what sort of different customers we have.

800
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,230
And once we know what
different customers we have,

801
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,213
we can find out their profitability.

802
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,210
Because it would be really interesting

803
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,420
to understand which ones are profitable

804
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,510
or more profitable or unprofitable

805
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,870
because we can use that data
to set our strategy, right?

806
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,670
If we are planning our
customer acquisition

807
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,990
for the next quarter,

808
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,430
we're gonna be spending
this sort of money,

809
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,880
well, what personas are we gonna target?

810
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,410
I'm probably gonna choose for the ones

811
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,570
that are more profitable personally.

812
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,763
But now we have some data to do that.

813
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,390
And we can explore these personas

814
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,790
by building up these
capability sets as well, right?

815
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,110
So I've created this
persona analysis capability,

816
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm getting good at it, right?

817
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,280
I've created ones for
usage and cost analysis,

818
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,670
and the agent's just doing half
of this work for me anyway.

819
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,830
And now when I go and query that,

820
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,390
what's that cost per persona?

821
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,060
It can use these other
capabilities recursively, right?

822
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,580
It's going to go and ask
what personas we have,

823
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,160
what sort of feature
usage those personas do,

824
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,440
and then we can use that cost per feature

825
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,200
to get some insights there.

826
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,360
Ask which ones are profitable,

827
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,390
ask do we have any
unprofitable ones, right?

828
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,030
So we're getting this
information that we can use

829
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,600
as data for creating more decisions.

830
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,270
And part of those decisions
and their strategy

831
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,493
is looking at our packaging, right?

832
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,750
And here we're creating
packages for the personas

833
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,700
that we've discovered, right?

834
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,150
Because you can target
your customers better.

835
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,200
And we can plan these
packages to foster an upsell,

836
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,630
to foster a conversion journey.

837
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,450
Another common conversation
I've had with customers

838
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,050
is they create this awesome SaaS product,

839
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,510
it's solving this great use case,

840
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,190
but they only have one service tier

841
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,900
and it's really expensive.

842
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,850
So they can't get new customers on

843
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,120
because their market
base is a small subset

844
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,400
of enterprises that have all that money.

845
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,860
And you need to think about,

846
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,290
well, how can I create
this basic value tier

847
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,720
that gets customers onto my product,

848
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,490
getting value out of that,

849
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,620
integrated into their business workflows

850
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,340
and then pushing them
into more higher value

851
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,470
for the customer and higher margin for you

852
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,670
as the SaaS vendor,

853
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,463
packages in the premium tier.

854
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,850
And once you're planning these packages,

855
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,030
you can forecast the
cost per package as well.

856
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,950
And this is going to be really important.

857
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,460
If we go back to that customer
acquisition example, right?

858
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,460
If I know which personas
I'm going to target

859
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,890
and I have an idea on
what a cost to serve at

860
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,680
and some sort of conversion rate success,

861
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,610
well, I can forecast what
sort of return on investment

862
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,853
I'm going to get by spending
in customer acquisition.

863
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,670
Or maybe you have some RFQs,

864
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,850
if you're a public sector,
RFQs are really common,

865
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,640
well, you need to understand
how low you can go

866
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,540
in terms of your offer and
also make an acceptable margin.

867
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,700
Well, now you've got that data, right?

868
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,733
And you can increase your
revenue with this approach.

869
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,553
And there are other ways

870
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:22,380
of increasing revenue per customer, right?

871
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,690
One way is by reducing churn.

872
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,360
Because when a customer
leaves, it's a bad thing.

873
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,250
Because not only are they leaving

874
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,550
and they're taking their
revenue stream with them,

875
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,980
but they probably still have the core need

876
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,270
why they came to you in the first place

877
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,550
so they're probably
looking at a competitor.

878
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,770
Now that competitor has
that revenue stream,

879
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,560
they're reinvesting that
to get better than you.

880
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,940
Don't wanna be in that place, right?

881
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,870
So this is why best-of-breed
SaaS vendors have this

882
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,593
as a core mechanism to retain customers.

883
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,790
And the other way by increasing
revenue is upsell, right?

884
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,110
We talked about that,

885
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,070
planning this conversion
journey, upselling.

886
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,940
Well, you need to look
and find the customers

887
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,280
that have potential for upsell.

888
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,100
And again, best-of-breed
SaaS, they know this as well,

889
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,180
and they build this

890
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,543
as core components inside
their business models.

891
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,900
So if you're in an early stage,

892
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,090
you don't have big teams that can do this,

893
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,003
well, how can our little
agent friends help us here?

894
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,040
Well, if we come back to these
capabilities that we created,

895
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,680
let's look at how we can detect churn.

896
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,970
I can go and ask,

897
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,570
set up some scheduled
automated request to say,

898
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,270
every night, go and look for
low usage customers, right?

899
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,090
It's gonna go check our usage metrics.

900
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,410
And if it finds some, it
needs to know what to do.

901
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,440
Now this is then a decision
for you as a business, right?

902
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,780
Because this is ultimately
a business process, right?

903
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,300
What do we do with potential churn risk?

904
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,470
It could be you say,

905
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,590
well, how important is that
customer to my business?

906
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,150
Because if they're really important,

907
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,250
well, we need to get feet
on the ground, right?

908
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,930
We need to be out shaking hands,

909
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,220
finding why they're not happy

910
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,740
and making sure we can retain them.

911
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,980
But that doesn't always scale,
so we end up building in

912
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,830
some sort of automated workflow, right?

913
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,990
Reach out with some templated email.

914
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,700
We've seen these in our inbox, right?

915
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,290
You get this email saying,
oh, please stay, customer.

916
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,243
Here's a 10% discount, whatever.

917
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,830
Very non-personal but it's
got a rate of success, right?

918
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,810
That's why we do it.

919
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,130
But we can improve that, right?

920
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,740
We can invoke our usage
analysis agent and say,

921
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,070
hey, this is the customer
that's at risk of leaving.

922
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,690
Based on their persona and their usage,

923
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,540
what would be a good way
to try and retain them?

924
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,440
So we get a personalized
response for their customer,

925
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,933
and this should yield a
better retention rate.

926
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,500
So this is cool, right?

927
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,930
But we can also improve this as well.

928
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,940
We can turn that customer reach-out

929
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,893
into a customer success function.

930
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,020
And that customer success,

931
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,180
this capability is going to
do the same thing, all right?

932
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,370
It's gonna create that
personalized response,

933
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,900
reach out to the customer,

934
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,440
but now it's tracking these
customer interactions,

935
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,950
it's seeing which ones are
more successful than others.

936
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,843
Basically learning from itself over time.

937
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,510
And we can do a similar approach

938
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,280
by looking at new customers, right?

939
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,990
Because when a new
customer comes on board,

940
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,330
we wanna make sure that they
get a short time to value,

941
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,913
they want to get them using your product,

942
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:28,410
getting that value locked in.

943
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,690
So we can do the same thing,

944
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,040
that same approach and just say,

945
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,630
well, if they have low usage

946
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,190
and they're a brand new customer,

947
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,650
we'll send them something that's
maybe more of a quick start

948
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,453
than trying to retain them, right?

949
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,850
And we can use these
same tools for upselling,

950
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,240
except now instead of looking
for low usage customers,

951
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,860
we're looking for high usage customers,

952
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,860
or maybe customers that
use specific feature sets.

953
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,830
And again, once we see an opportunity,

954
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,150
we follow that same approach,

955
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,940
reach out to our customer
success capability

956
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,590
and create this personalized approach,

957
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,560
except now we are looking
to upgrade the customer

958
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,153
instead of retaining them.

959
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:09,060
And these capabilities,

960
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,410
these aren't brand new things, right?

961
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,480
I didn't invent customer success.

962
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,370
If you've been in the
SaaS field for a while,

963
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,110
you know that customer success

964
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,320
is a standard business
unit, standard capability.

965
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,120
And things like usage analysis,

966
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,710
that's been done by product owners

967
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,750
since product owners started.

968
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,370
But the difference is that

969
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,890
now you're able to
implement these with agents

970
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,600
without having to build up head count,

971
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,080
without having to build up
physical teams to do this.

972
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,620
And this is really, really
awesome because that means

973
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,600
that you can start getting
these best-of-breed,

974
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,933
these mature SaaS attributes
straight from day one.

975
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,143
And we can see that

976
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:47,490
not only is GenAI fundamentally changing

977
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,040
how we build our SaaS products,

978
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,660
it's also fundamentally changing

979
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,900
how we operate them as well.

980
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,120
And to give another example of this,

981
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,700
I'd like to pass back to Damika,

982
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,040
who's going to look at resource management

983
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,363
and resource efficiency.

984
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,770
- Thanks Dave.

985
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,010
So resource management in SaaS
is always a balancing act.

986
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,730
You provision too little,
it'll impact the performance.

987
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,800
If you end up provision
too much of infrastructure,

988
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,800
it'll kill be profit margins, right?

989
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,000
So that's why it's critical

990
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,273
but also very challenging
control plane service to have.

991
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:30,690
So this is where GenAI can
help a lot to automate,

992
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,980
to improve the operational efficiency,

993
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,173
and also the agility
of the overall module.

994
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,720
Resource management always starts

995
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,890
with the resource monitoring.

996
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,600
If you look at how we used to do that

997
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,373
in traditional SaaS applications,

998
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,430
we already had the consumption matrix

999
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,120
and the access logs of the
tenants in the control plane.

1000
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,390
And then we define the
service level objectives

1001
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,520
for the solution, SLOs.

1002
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,520
This stands for the
infrastructure level thresholds

1003
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:02,310
that the tenants are allowed
to use at the maximum level.

1004
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,430
And then we had the
monitoring microservice

1005
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,950
constantly looking at the tenant usage

1006
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,500
and checking if there
is any SLO violations.

1007
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,130
If so, there is a notification
to the DevOps team.

1008
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,780
So the DevOps team comes in,

1009
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,670
identify the issue, identify the fix,

1010
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,680
and then verify once the fix is done,

1011
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,780
the whole bunch of manual work down there.

1012
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,810
So if you really wanna
bring some acceleration

1013
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,790
and quick wins using GenAI,

1014
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:31,790
you can always lean into a
preloaded AI agent like Kiro CLI,

1015
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,760
provide the context,

1016
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,080
let it know how the solution works,

1017
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,680
and brainstorm about the notification

1018
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,550
that you may have received

1019
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,780
or about anything directly
about the attendance as well,

1020
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,280
it will provide some guidance.

1021
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,240
But if you really want
to make this automated

1022
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,130
as a part of the SaaS architecture,

1023
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,480
one of the first things that you wanna do

1024
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,170
is to understand how the
SaaS resource monitoring

1025
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,163
and the management workflow
would work, like is,

1026
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,250
and so that, how can you automate that?

1027
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,830
So everything starts with
the resource monitoring.

1028
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,931
Why?

1029
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:06,930
Because then we can
understand the anomalies,

1030
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,740
which are the suspicious tenant activities

1031
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,330
that ideally, they are still
violations, but with GenAI,

1032
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,300
you will see that there is
a broader scope than that.

1033
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,460
So once we know the anomalies,

1034
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,130
then we need to figure out
whether they are actually,

1035
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,680
if they are leading
into anything critical,

1036
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,760
any critical conditions,

1037
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,830
anything concerning such as noise enablers

1038
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:33,830
or resource misuses or API
spikes and things like that.

1039
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,360
So for that, with GenAI,

1040
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,780
we can leverage pattern recognition.

1041
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,150
So once we know the
potential critical condition,

1042
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:46,260
then we can focus GenAI
components looking at them

1043
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,420
and identify the corrective actions,

1044
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,950
which are the infrastructure level changes

1045
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,470
that we need to do to
mitigate those conditions.

1046
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,620
And then we can go and
fix them, monitor them,

1047
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,890
and then verify if the
condition has been resolved.

1048
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,590
Now when you want to automate this

1049
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,940
for your SaaS application,

1050
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,830
certainly there will be
more steps coming up,

1051
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,500
but I would consider
this as the bare minimal

1052
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,480
that you need to automate anyway.

1053
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,700
So let's see how this
flow can be implemented

1054
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,620
using GenAI technologies.

1055
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,460
Now for the anomalies,

1056
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,290
we are gonna implement an
anomaly detection agent

1057
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,620
that can be triggered using
a prompt simple workflow.

1058
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,700
It'll take the current usage
of the tenants, and then SLOs,

1059
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,000
and leverage to the LLM
ask for any anomalies.

1060
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,510
So in the prompt you can ask

1061
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,870
to crosscheck the current
usage with the SLOs

1062
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,660
and also any additional
considerations as well,

1063
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,600
such as consider on the business impact,

1064
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,350
consider on the tier configuration
of this particular tenant

1065
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,930
and the impact to the
other tenants of the tier,

1066
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,550
and things like that.

1067
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,080
So based on your SaaS application,

1068
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,330
you can keep on adding more
and more considerations.

1069
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,370
So what happens is now the agent

1070
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:58,200
is having better and bigger
scope to identify the anomalies

1071
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,900
without missing out anything else.

1072
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,390
So once we know the anomalies,

1073
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,770
at this stage we are gonna log them

1074
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,780
into the resource analysis data store

1075
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,670
and then move on to the next step.

1076
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,710
If you look at these anomalies,

1077
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,140
they are filled with data points

1078
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,430
that justifies why the agent
thought this would be anomaly,

1079
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,960
such as the statistical analysis

1080
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,670
of the threshold violations,

1081
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,110
and also the LLM analysis

1082
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,453
will also provide some level of details.

1083
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,810
So once we know these anomalies,

1084
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,980
next is to identify

1085
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,650
whether these are leading
into anything critical,

1086
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,450
any critical conditions.

1087
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,283
So for that,

1088
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:37,353
we are gonna add a pattern
recognition agent in here.

1089
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,200
Now for the pattern recognition agent,

1090
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,200
we will provide the knowledge
to the agent upfront

1091
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,420
about the potential critical condition

1092
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,490
that could have happened
in the SaaS architecture.

1093
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,250
For example, how do you
define a noise enabler?

1094
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,670
And how do you identify a resource misuse

1095
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,470
and security issues and things like that?

1096
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,110
So that knowledge is already
there with the agent.

1097
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,110
So with that, when it gets
executed with the workflow,

1098
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,100
first take the anomaly that was identified

1099
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,570
and then get the tenant ID or tenant,

1100
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:20,570
and then get all the current
and the historical usage data

1101
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,260
from the control plane.

1102
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,330
And then leverage to the LLM,

1103
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,033
and then ask for potential
critical conditions.

1104
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:28,950
Now through the prompt,

1105
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,950
we can specifically mention
to conduct the usage temporal

1106
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,320
and the behavioral pattern recognition

1107
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,610
of this given anomaly

1108
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,690
against the historical
or the usage data set,

1109
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,960
so the agent will know how
many times this anomaly

1110
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,210
or something similar to this
anomaly has been repeated

1111
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,043
in the past

1112
00:47:49,043 --> 00:47:51,090
and what is the criticality
and the importance of that

1113
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,010
so that it can map the anomaly

1114
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,443
into a critical condition that's given.

1115
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,240
So once we identify any
potential patterns like that,

1116
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,470
we will log them in here,

1117
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,920
in the resource analysis
data store and move forward.

1118
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,410
And these potential patterns
will clearly mention

1119
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,890
what is the condition that is concerning.

1120
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,800
For example, in this case,
Tenant 004 has been identified

1121
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,930
as a potential noisy neighbor.

1122
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:16,800
Why?

1123
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,820
That anomaly has been
repeated about 100-plus times

1124
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,716
during last few days,

1125
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:25,920
70% of which has been
during the last two hours.

1126
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,880
And also the agent has
predicted that 80% of that

1127
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,390
will likely to happen in the
next three hours as well.

1128
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:37,170
It relates to heavy CPU and resource usage

1129
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,790
during the off-peak time,

1130
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,553
certainly someone has to
look into this immediately.

1131
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,480
However, if you look at our architecture,

1132
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,970
we are not yet ready to process
those critical conditions,

1133
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,710
we just have a couple of agents only,

1134
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,510
so it needs some improvement.

1135
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,550
First improvement, we are
gonna have a supervisor agent

1136
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,340
for the orchestration,
and then we will introduce

1137
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,190
a condition specific agentic layer

1138
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,650
where there will be a dedicated agent

1139
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,020
per critical condition.

1140
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,410
One for noise neighbors, one
for handling resource misuses,

1141
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,600
maybe one for security as well

1142
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,640
who will be handling cases like

1143
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,433
unauthorized cross-tenant
data access and so on.

1144
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,320
So the advantage is that

1145
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,170
now I can provide focused knowledge,

1146
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,260
the tools, and the capabilities agent-wise

1147
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,470
based on their focus area,

1148
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,380
based on the condition
that they're focusing on

1149
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,750
so that their decision-making capabilities

1150
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,453
will be much more advanced and accurate.

1151
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,060
So maybe the final enhancement
to the architecture

1152
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,893
at this stage is

1153
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,130
if you look at the resource
analysis data store,

1154
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,020
we have been keep on
adding all the anomalies,

1155
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,450
the patterns, critical conditions,

1156
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,590
and down the line you will see

1157
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,390
we'll add all the corrective actions

1158
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,400
and the actual fixes that we are doing

1159
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,080
into the same data store.

1160
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,850
So over time,

1161
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,700
this data source is gonna be
the single source of truth

1162
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,920
that represent the entire SaaS monitoring

1163
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,250
and the management module
of the SaaS application.

1164
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,290
It's a huge amount of knowledge.

1165
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,080
So what we can do is
I'm gonna connote this

1166
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,140
into a vector store and build
a knowledge base out of that,

1167
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,490
and then inject that knowledge

1168
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,550
to each and every specialist
agent that I have.

1169
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,950
So now they are more capable,

1170
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:19,440
the addition making would
be much more accurate

1171
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,933
with the historical knowledge as well.

1172
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:23,963
Now with this,

1173
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:26,970
if you move on to the architecture

1174
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,920
and then see if you have a noisy neighbor,

1175
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,350
potential noisy neighbor to handle,

1176
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,270
like in our previous example,

1177
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,790
the supervisor agent just need to trigger

1178
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,630
the noisy neighbor agent

1179
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,570
which is already configured
with the knowledge and the tools

1180
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,990
and it'll refer to the potential pattern

1181
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:46,653
and then ask for two things from the LLM,

1182
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,430
can you confirm whether this
is actually a noisy neighbor?

1183
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,310
So the agent will use
the existing knowledge

1184
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,130
to decide whether that is
a noisy neighbor or not.

1185
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,730
If yes, what are the corrective
actions we need to do

1186
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,113
to mitigate the situation?

1187
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,443
So if you look at the output,

1188
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,520
it will clearly mention the confirmation

1189
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,920
and also the corrective
actions that we need to do

1190
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,483
at the infrastructure level.

1191
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,910
So this format will be same
for all the critical conditions

1192
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,073
that you're gonna have in our solution.

1193
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,780
Now this is great, right?

1194
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,613
This is great.

1195
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:28,290
But the big question is
who's gonna verify this?

1196
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,580
Who's gonna do this?

1197
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,620
Traditionally, we had
our DevOps team coming in

1198
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,570
and doing these infrastructural changes,

1199
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,150
but now we have an agentic layer

1200
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,290
doing most of the stuff for us.

1201
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:40,680
So where we have to lean in in this case.

1202
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,120
So there are many options.

1203
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,300
So my recommendation is

1204
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,710
when you have these kind
of corrective actions

1205
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,100
or critical conditions found
in your SaaS application,

1206
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,530
prompt that to a natural
language interface

1207
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,810
and have a human in the loop.

1208
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:59,340
Ideally an expert in the house
on DevOps who can come in

1209
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,200
and review these critical conditions

1210
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,750
at the corrective actions.

1211
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,200
And then maybe ask questions
from the agentic layer

1212
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,930
about these options, get to know them more

1213
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,260
and verify what needs to
be executed out of these,

1214
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,580
if not all.

1215
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,820
And then use the existing
DevOps and the GenAI tools

1216
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,710
to do the fixes

1217
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,810
and let the supervisor agent know about it

1218
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,040
so that it can self-generate a prompt

1219
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,710
that will trigger the existing pipeline,

1220
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,500
but this time only for
this particular tenant

1221
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,123
and only to verify the fixes
for the critical condition.

1222
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,853
That's it.

1223
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:42,660
So that way we are kind of
reusing the same workflow,

1224
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,510
same pipeline without having any,

1225
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:49,230
without needing to have any
additional instrumentation

1226
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,910
for monitor and verify.

1227
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,760
What we can do is we can even
have a verification window

1228
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,430
during which we will run
this prompt few times

1229
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:00,393
just to absolutely make
sure that the fix worked.

1230
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,753
All right.

1231
00:53:02,753 --> 00:53:06,150
So again, when you
wanna kind of adopt this

1232
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,170
to a new SaaS application,

1233
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,160
I highly recommend to have
the human in the loop option

1234
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,260
that will improve the confidence

1235
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,050
of the infrastructure level
changes that you are doing

1236
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,010
in your production system.

1237
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,340
And also it'll help you to
understand overall accuracy

1238
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,170
of the output of the agentic layer

1239
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,170
so any improvements can be identified.

1240
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,620
So you can keep on
modernizing the agentic layer

1241
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,860
until you have a better
confidence about the output

1242
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,990
so that you can even plan to pass

1243
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,660
or hand off some of the responsibilities

1244
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,283
to the agentic layer as well.

1245
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,590
Hope this will help you

1246
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,305
to entirely automate your SaaS monitoring

1247
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:48,243
and the management layer by
using GenAI technologies.

1248
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:53,070
All right, so we talked
a lot about GenAI today

1249
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,780
and how we can bring
the GenAI capabilities

1250
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,180
into the SaaS control plane.

1251
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,880
We took a lot of examples
in explaining that as well.

1252
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,210
So in summary as key takeaways,

1253
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,620
if you are early into
the process, start small.

1254
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,360
There are enough preloaded AI agents

1255
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,100
and MCP service out there

1256
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,690
that you can use to put together,

1257
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,980
get something up and running,

1258
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,950
that show some results real
quick in your control plane.

1259
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,280
So always lead your teams
to that to start with.

1260
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,350
If you are there already,

1261
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,150
identify a few areas
that you can modernize

1262
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:27,720
in your control plane and bring
the agentic capabilities in.

1263
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,590
I highly recommend

1264
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:32,010
you have a closer look at
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore service

1265
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,893
and its features, it has
a lot to offer to you.

1266
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,060
Feel free to bring the right tools

1267
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,830
and bring the right
capabilities to the agent

1268
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,830
so that their decision making
capabilities will be higher.

1269
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,900
And also always start with the data.

1270
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,190
If you don't see the right data
set that an agent requires,

1271
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,290
start from instrumenting
the application plane

1272
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,960
and bring the data set
first into the control plane

1273
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,633
so that you can then talk
about the agentic workflow.

1274
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,450
So finally take the leadership

1275
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,170
to kind of provide the
guidance required to your team

1276
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,450
and the organization to
bring the GenAI capabilities

1277
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,770
into this control plane.

1278
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,060
Now that you know,

1279
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,760
it's not only the automation
and the operational efficiency,

1280
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,100
but it can also help things

1281
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,590
like maximizing the profit margin

1282
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,190
of the SaaS application as well.

1283
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,270
Now we went through these
three use cases much deeply

1284
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,160
in terms of the design and implementation

1285
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,250
just to showcase you what is
possible and how it is done.

1286
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,760
So I highly recommend that
you plan to implement them

1287
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,170
in your SAS application,

1288
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,870
and in general my call to
action for you all would be,

1289
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,730
identify the remaining
control plane services as well

1290
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,430
that you wanna modernize and
feel free to bring the agents

1291
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,993
and the GenAI capabilities into
the implementation as well.

1292
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,753
All right everybody,

1293
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:51,750
so this is the kind of content

1294
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,190
that we want to share with you all.

1295
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,410
I hope this is what you expected
from the session as well,

1296
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,870
and I believe now you
have a better perspective,

1297
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,210
better confidence about bringing GenAI

1298
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:04,200
and the agentic capabilities
into the control plane.

1299
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,870
Just a quick couple of
things before wrapping up.

1300
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,310
These are some of the SaaS sessions

1301
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,490
that our team is hosting
during next few days

1302
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,323
in the re:Invent as well.

1303
00:56:12,323 --> 00:56:15,030
So if you're interested,
please take a note of it.

1304
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,700
There are some workshops
and the builder sessions

1305
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,163
that will be very hands-on as well.

1306
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,960
And finally, there should be a survey link

1307
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,970
for this particular
session in your mobile lab.

1308
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,910
So please let us know your
feedback, super important.

1309
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,800
We will be looking at
them with high interest

1310
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,030
to learn from you

1311
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,840
and also to shape up our future
re:Invent sessions as well.

1312
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,980
All right, everybody,

1313
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,930
a huge thank you to all of you

1314
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,280
for being here in this evening.

1315
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,500
Thanks Dave for co-presenting
with me as well.

1316
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,570
I wish you all have a
awesome remaining part

1317
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,800
of the re:Invent, everybody.

1318
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,688
Have a wonderful evening.

1319
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:49,908
(audience applauds)
