1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,880
- Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,060
Welcome to "AWS re:Invent."

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,090
I'm Andre Barreira, Managing
Director from Accenture.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,060
It's a real pleasure to
be here with my colleagues

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,060
from Illumia and Accenture,
Daniel Salvador, and Gustavo.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,190
Today we show you how Illumia
and Accenture partner with AWS

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,640
to reinvent customer
service across 11 countries.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,700
But before dive into the solution,

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,820
let's take a quick look at Illumia.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,222
The company at the heart of reinvention.

11
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:39,389
(gentle somber music)

12
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:58,369
(dramatic rousing music)

13
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,921
(upbeat rousing music)

14
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,570
And to kick things off, I will
hand it to Daniel Figueirido.

15
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,483
The CEO and the founder of Illumia.

16
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,572
- Thank you very much.

17
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,600
(audience applauding)

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,670
For me, it's a real pleasure to be here.

19
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,800
Thank you, Andre, for this introduction

20
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:05,640
and to have the chance
to work so many times

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,890
during my career together, yeah?

22
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,600
You do something wrong
in your previous life.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,850
I dunno. (laughs)

24
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,200
My name is Daniel Figueirido.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,528
I am the CEO and founder of Illumia.

26
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:19,164
My last name is quite unpronounced,

27
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:23,336
so everybody say me, Danny or Figa, yeah?

28
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:26,189
And you know, when I arrive here,

29
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,640
I look very familiar faces, yeah?

30
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,520
I have friends in different
parts of the world,

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,800
so I am glad to meet you here.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,750
So, let me start with,

33
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,690
how many of you are
coming from Latin America?

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,240
Raise your hands. Good.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,090
So, (speaking in foreign language) yeah?

36
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,353
Thank you for being here.

37
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,610
Let me try to introduce
Illumia and Grupo Werthein.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,150
Grupo Werthein is a private economic group

39
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,043
in Latin America.

40
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:01,290
It's an Argentine group

41
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,173
that started business in many industries.

42
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:08,385
Media tech, insurance, banking, IT,

43
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:12,400
agribusiness, and constructions,

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
and probably others that I don't remember.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,120
And also in terms of IT.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,883
So, we are part of Grupo Werthein.

47
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,852
Illumia born as a result of
the impact of digitalization,

48
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:29,040
the impact of Gen AI.

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,322
The disruption that Gen AI is creating

50
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:33,840
in everything that we are doing, yeah?

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,375
So, there is a strong need of efficiency

52
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:40,994
and strong need of treating customers

53
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:44,100
in many of the companies that we manage.

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,450
And we needed to do this right.

55
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,180
And let me tell you one thing.

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,635
We try many times for doing projects,

57
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,773
for doing transformation.

58
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,430
To do and to implement Gen AI

59
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,430
in our business process at
scale is not transformation.

60
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,720
It's re:Invent as Amazon is
saying or a kind of revolution.

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,433
That's why we created Illumia.

62
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,260
What we do and what we offer
to the market. Three things.

63
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,721
Customer service as a,

64
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,720
Customer Care as a Service,

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,090
or Customer Journey as a Service.

66
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,040
Automation as a Service.

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,490
And also MarTech solutions.

68
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,707
Campaigns, how to manage
and to monetize data

69
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,003
in the different companies

70
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:37,575
and the different clients
that we are managing.

71
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:40,530
And obviously, business
transformation outsourcing.

72
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,530
In 2002, Grupo Werthein bought
from AT&T, DirecTV and Sky.

73
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,230
Sky is the name that
DirecTV is used in Brazil.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,332
And from that on, we started
a very huge transformation

75
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,991
and getting very huge
process of, you know,

76
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:03,990
getting efficient and
transforming the company.

77
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,850
And Illumia was a key player
on that transformation.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,270
And DirecTV in Latin America is operating

79
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,680
12 different countries.

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,950
The entire Latin America, the Caribbean,

81
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,600
and also Puerto Rico.

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,330
So as a context, because
you probably listen

83
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,380
to Grupo Werthein, to Illumia,
to many different things,

84
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,523
and it's important to put
some context on who we are.

85
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,460
And let me try to put some
challenges that we faced.

86
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,380
And not necessarily the
ones that you're facing,

87
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,510
but we faced those, yeah?

88
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,010
We talk and we get promises
around digital first

89
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,470
for customer care for many years.

90
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,770
And how many of you listen the same things

91
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,770
and at the end is still
contact center, yeah?

92
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,330
Raise your hands. How many?

93
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,990
How many? It's our challenge, yeah?

94
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,620
Second, you know, customer data.

95
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,022
We have data lakes, we have
data all over the places

96
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,190
and it is a nightmare.

97
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,800
A real nightmare how to deal with this.

98
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,930
And more important, how to monetize data

99
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,479
at the time that we want to provide

100
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,830
a better service to our companies,

101
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,570
a better services to our clients.

102
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,890
Raise your hands.

103
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,203
Who are facing the same problem, yeah?

104
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,100
Okay. Very huge problem.

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,123
And the last one, and not less important.

106
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,210
Everybody in Latin America
is doing MVPs, books,

107
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,210
and many tries in order to
use Gen AI in their processes.

108
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,900
And at the end of the day, how to measure

109
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,609
and how to identify results are not so,

110
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:57,360
it's not so evident, yeah?

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,426
The issue of tokenization

112
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:02,220
and how to consume different platforms

113
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,740
sometimes is diluting or,

114
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,490
and in some points the
efficiency is not relevant, yeah?

115
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,630
So, those are the changes that we faced,

116
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,030
probably are the changes
that many of you are facing

117
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,700
in your companies.

118
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,833
And we started from
these challenges, yeah?

119
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,482
What we are doing at Illumia,
if we need to define.

120
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:33,482
Obviously, technology is
what we are investing in

121
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,700
and what we are managing.

122
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,970
But at the end, we are not
selling technology, yeah?

123
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,770
We are selling outcomes.

124
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,310
We are selling what we call
a Service as a Software.

125
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,985
We are selling our
clients and our companies

126
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:51,630
that we are intensive use.

127
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,390
We are doing intensive use of technology,

128
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,490
but at the end we are not trying to charge

129
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,370
or to transfer that technology to anybody.

130
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,670
We are selling business outcomes, yeah?

131
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,549
And we have models of pricing
and the way that we operate

132
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,610
and deliver these services,

133
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,960
and we build that based
on specific outcome, yeah?

134
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,489
Transactions or the driver
this, that are, you know,

135
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:21,540
linking the results with the business case

136
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,490
that our clients are producing.

137
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,353
So, this is what we are doing.

138
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,142
The idea today is to
present some of the cases

139
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:34,349
that we are managing and how
we are dealing with all these,

140
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,349
is all these challenges in
Latin America and in our places.

141
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,590
We are working with an
ecosystems of strategic partners.

142
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,200
We cannot do this alone, yeah?

143
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,050
Obviously, Amazon is a strategic partner.

144
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,303
Accenture that is hosting this session

145
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:54,360
is a strategic partner.

146
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,920
But we have others, yeah?

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,425
We have nice, we have
ESPs in Latin America

148
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:03,068
because we are offering
end-to-end solutions

149
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:05,520
for our clients.

150
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,010
So, this is Illumia.

151
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,210
We are going right now

152
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,230
to moving to how we are managing this

153
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,490
and how we are delivering
what I am presenting today.

154
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,480
- Hello, everyone.

155
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,690
I'm Lumi, the AI agent from Illumia.

156
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,120
Illumia was born with a clear purpose

157
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,478
in partnership with Accenture and AWS,

158
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:30,180
to transform how companies
connect with their customers

159
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,070
where empathy, agility, and
intelligence coexist seamlessly.

160
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,330
Let me share a bit more about
how our business model works.

161
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,270
But first, a few numbers
that speak for themselves.

162
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,858
According to market benchmarks,
companies that adopted

163
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:47,504
Generative AI and customer
service have reduced

164
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,910
operational costs by up to 40%,

165
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,960
increased first contact
resolution by up to 70%,

166
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,630
boosted conversion rates
through data monetization

167
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,630
by up to 50%, and improved
NPS by as much as 25 points.

168
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,020
Illumia delivers what few
traditional organizations can.

169
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,540
Customer care that is
empathetic, efficient,

170
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,310
scalable, and secure.

171
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,380
We offer flexible commercial models,

172
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,360
including outcome-based engagements,

173
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,010
business-aligned pricing,

174
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,280
and even the integration of
internal or third-party teams

175
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,380
under an outsourcing model.

176
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,300
Thank you for allowing
me to share a glimpse

177
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,620
of Illumia with you.

178
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,150
See you soon.

179
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,920
- Thank you, Lumi, for the introduction.

180
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,937
I will pass this to Salvador Alvarez.

181
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:36,393
Salvador Alvarez is the Chief
Commercial Officer of Illumia.

182
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:41,393
Also a great friend and he
will continue to explain the,

183
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,100
how we deliver these challenges.

184
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,930
- Excellent. Well, thank you very much.

185
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,360
Thanks everybody for this.

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,250
So, as Daniel said, you know,

187
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,458
we have been working for
years in this industry,

188
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,163
talking with different
customers in the region,

189
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,630
and we always find the same
answer when it comes to AI.

190
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,225
It's sometimes it's failing
to deliver the promise

191
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,590
of operational efficiencies.

192
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,520
We have many companies

193
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,530
that actually are trying
to build solutions,

194
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,450
micro solutions, mega solutions,

195
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,210
big and bloated chat box
that you see everywhere.

196
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,145
That sometimes it really
fails to really drive

197
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:15,963
what the customer really needs.

198
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,553
Also, every one of us works
in a large enterprise,

199
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,684
have plenty of supports,

200
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,128
working and testing different agents

201
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:29,220
in order to make sense,
and to beat the FOMO.

202
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,660
You know, the fear of missing out.

203
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,960
There's something there that
actually we need to explore,

204
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,060
but sometimes we're not sure how to do it.

205
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,310
So, what we have done in Illumia

206
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,993
is take a different approach.

207
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,290
How we start with the business?

208
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,550
So, we sit down with the business.

209
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,263
Our stakeholders are the
CEOs, CMOs, COOs, CFOs.

210
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,950
And we talk about customer care

211
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,650
because that's our specialization.

212
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,610
So, we're purely a company
that drives the service,

213
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,610
customer care with deep domain
knowledge of it as software.

214
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,540
Using a platform that
actually we build together

215
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,783
with AWS and Accenture.

216
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,483
So, we not only have a
very skilled technical team

217
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:18,000
that actually do the solutions,

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,070
but we also have an excellent team

219
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,270
when it comes to customer care.

220
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,400
Our leaders are ex-CMOs.

221
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,480
You know, leading the operations

222
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,580
for large organizations
across the regions.

223
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,740
But that's really important.
That's a big differentiator.

224
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,940
We start with the business.
We start with the outcome.

225
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,000
We empower ourselves with
a platform fueled by AI.

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,880
But as you all know, AI is not the answer

227
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,190
for everything that actually we need.

228
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,290
Sometimes we need automation tools.

229
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,073
Sometimes we just need to
redefine how the processes work.

230
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,958
And this allow us to take
some risks when it comes,

231
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,160
you know, to our engagement
with our customers.

232
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,302
So, we start with the business case.

233
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:57,183
And we commit to the business case.

234
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,720
We make sure that actually we simplify

235
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,060
the implementation of the technology.

236
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,280
We simplify the charger model.

237
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,160
As Daniel says, you know, we
don't use tokenization model.

238
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,990
That actually becomes
a system that actually

239
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,363
is very unpredictable
when it comes to cost.

240
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,360
Actually we consolidate that

241
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,610
in the analysis that actually we do.

242
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,710
And we weave a fixed cost that
actually helps the customer

243
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,710
to take from the fixed cost
statement to a variable model

244
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,840
in a very predictable manner.

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,410
So, we try to drive all the benefits of AI

246
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,490
to the outcomes of the business.

247
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,600
So, today we're going to see some

248
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
of those demos of how we do it.

249
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,390
We're going to have also
a technical explanation

250
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,130
for those that are more
than the technical side

251
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,863
of what they need to know
to do this and how we do it.

252
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,960
Conversations are key for us, okay?

253
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,780
So, we engage not only
in the first engagement,

254
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,797
you know, when an
interest with a customer,

255
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:56,550
you know, for example,
comes to our organizations.

256
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,110
It doesn't really matter if it's voice,

257
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,153
if it's text, if it's another API,

258
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,920
we put a lot of effort in creating models,

259
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,803
voices, and connections
that are very empathetic.

260
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,520
Because this is a journey for all of us.

261
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,897
It's a journey that actually
we all transit to say,

262
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:17,383
"How do I move for a traditional
conversation and engagement

263
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:20,910
with an organization for
products and services?"

264
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,490
And now how do we move in this new model?

265
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,591
Not only for our interactions
with all the agents,

266
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,220
but also agent to agent.

267
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,580
Agent to traditional models
that actually we need it.

268
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,470
So, those conversations

269
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,222
are not only on the first
line of side that is actually,

270
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,620
how do I take the conversation?

271
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,513
We also take the customer journey.

272
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,333
What else?

273
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,420
What happens behind the scenes

274
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,430
in order for that to happen?

275
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,010
So, we had to redesign
those customer journeys.

276
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,560
We work with our customers
trying to redefine them

277
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,520
in order to make it more efficient

278
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,600
using the knowledge that actually we have.

279
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,630
And if you use a platform
that is not intrusive.

280
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,480
We believe in non-intrusive platforms.

281
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,403
We don't require the customers

282
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,990
to change anything that actually they do.

283
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,260
We help to orchestrate, we
help to create that ecosystems

284
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,030
that actually integrate
not only the agents

285
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,850
that actually we can bring
forward in order to do the things

286
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,770
that actually we need to do,

287
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,770
but also to reuse and maximize
the use of APIs, agents,

288
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,223
ERPs, or systems that actually
the customers may have.

289
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,430
And finally we engage with people.

290
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,330
How we empower them, how
we make the assistant,

291
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,600
how we contextualize the business.

292
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,990
So, those interactions
becomes human agents.

293
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,740
It's a hybrid model that
actually we need to do.

294
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,670
When we engage with people as well,

295
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,883
we can commit to the end-to-end
operational efficiency cost.

296
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,753
And this has been very well
received by our customers.

297
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,957
I have the firsthand experience.

298
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,387
Every time I go there I say like,

299
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:55,320
"Listen, I'm not here
to sell you technology.

300
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,650
I'm not here saying you
need license or a platform.

301
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,527
I will work with you on outcomes."

302
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,770
And that's a surprise.

303
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,440
At least in Latin America,

304
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,450
it's a model that actually
not all the companies

305
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,250
are challenges are willing to take.

306
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,550
Instead of being a PPT or
a PowerPoint presentations,

307
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,080
you know, with all the
promises, all the things

308
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,636
that actually we are going
to do are going to make

309
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:22,620
if you hire us, we say we trust our skill,

310
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,920
we trust our platforms, and
we're going to commit to do it.

311
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,420
So, we guarantee the results

312
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,490
when it comes to operational efficiencies.

313
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,820
If something costs a hundred,
we say it will cost 80.

314
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,260
It will cost 80.

315
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,380
And it's our responsibility as a company

316
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,193
that actually has about the
domain knowledge to deliver it.

317
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,733
Omnichannel.

318
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,430
Maybe a conversation starting one channel,

319
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,190
but maybe it's not the most
efficient for it to resolve it.

320
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,763
For example, Roadside Assistance.

321
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,590
You may receive a call

322
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,290
because you need some
support for your car.

323
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,300
But actually you need to
do a localization services

324
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,920
and maybe in the phone
it's not easy to get it.

325
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,870
So, let's do a parallel
connection with them.

326
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,112
Let's open an SMS or a
WhatsApp so we can interact

327
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,950
in multiple channels at the same time.

328
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,206
That's really important
in order to orchestrate

329
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,440
those communications in a
multi-channel environment

330
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
and maybe switching them if it's possible.

331
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,633
So, the conversations last a
matter, within the platform.

332
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,060
That means that the model of the super app

333
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,790
is a model that actually
we keep challenging.

334
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,934
We all love to have super apps.

335
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:35,493
Oh, I want my customer to
install the apps for my company.

336
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,040
But that's not scalable.

337
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,327
If you think about the amount
of services and products

338
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,170
that actually you consume.

339
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,470
How many apps you know
you need in your phone?

340
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,380
So, we're moving a pure agentic model.

341
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,770
What it means is that if
I use interfaces like,

342
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,910
for example, Anthropic, whilst I'm driving

343
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,213
and I need to book, I don't
know, a table in a restaurant.

344
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,070
And maybe that restaurant
doesn't have an agent or an API,

345
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,040
I may use an agent to go to that website

346
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
and do the work for you.

347
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,383
Connect the agentic model to
the more traditional model.

348
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,030
Or maybe, I don't know, you
want to open a complaint

349
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,080
in a company that actually has a website,

350
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,570
I will use an agent to
go through that website

351
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,560
and do the complaint for you.

352
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,907
So, we understand the interfaces

353
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:29,250
and we interact with interfaces.

354
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,573
We try to make it simpler.

355
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,541
So, not all we think
about an incoming message

356
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,370
that actually heard.

357
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,463
But this is ecosystem that
actually comes and goes.

358
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,177
So in our vision, I don't know

359
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,377
if you're gonna need
websites in the future.

360
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,373
Why?

361
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,460
It may be an interface of the past.

362
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,880
We can do an API, we
can do agent-to-agent.

363
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,760
Even we can have an agent that
actually go through an IVR,

364
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,923
makes a call, navigate through the IVR,

365
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,043
and have a conversation with an agent.

366
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,860
It is an intermediate
steps of where we're going.

367
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,529
In whichever state you are,
our platform supports it.

368
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,323
And that's really important for us.

369
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,230
Empathetic agentic model.

370
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,230
In order to do that, we do an
architecture of micro agents.

371
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,610
White labeling micro
agents like Lego blocks

372
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,870
that actually you can put together.

373
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,190
We can create some of them together.

374
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,110
We create some with the
customers and we paralyze them.

375
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,110
In every interaction, we
may have 4, 5, 6, 7 agents

376
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,973
listening to that channel,
to that conversation.

377
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,603
The model that actually you build an agent

378
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:45,261
that actually you keep
expanding it with more knowledge

379
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,830
actually doesn't work.

380
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,300
We tried it.

381
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,773
Probably you tried before.

382
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,830
What happens is you train it in one way,

383
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,450
then you try to adjust it,

384
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,373
and somehow it start hallucinating.

385
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,260
So, the model is micro agents
in parallel, specialize them.

386
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,540
It works much better.

387
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,250
That means I can have an agent

388
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,493
that actually is monitoring
the sentiment of the call.

389
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,400
If I'm complaining, I may
have an agent that actually

390
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,950
specialize in retention

391
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,850
or specialize in up and cross-selling.

392
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,200
And we need to be able to
move those agents on the fly

393
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,850
because the conversation
may go in another direction.

394
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,550
So, we keep choosing
which is the right agent

395
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,900
in that moment of the conversation.

396
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,300
It's like having different
parts of your brain

397
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,210
trying to compete with one
agent that coordinates that.

398
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,420
We're going to see some of the
demos that actually do that.

399
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,190
But that's really important
for us in order to make sure

400
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,373
that actually we can
engage in empathetic model.

401
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,023
And Danny mentioned a
powerful MarTech solution.

402
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,120
If we keep track of those conversation,

403
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,070
we remember those conversations,
we know what you're doing.

404
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,240
We can create campaigns with agents

405
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,490
that actually analyze your data,

406
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,490
analyze your promotions,
your products, services.

407
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,473
And based on all those engagements,

408
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,600
we can embed

409
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,430
these up and cross-selling
agents in the model

410
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,920
that actually will navigate
through all those conversations,

411
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,640
all those interactions and
be activated on the fly.

412
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,109
So for example, if you are
engaging in a roadside accident,

413
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,843
maybe, I don't know, I may,
it will be an opportunity

414
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:34,923
to sell you an add-on in the insurance.

415
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,383
So, we send all these agents
to hunt for the opportunity.

416
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,860
And that's why we see the future
also for MarTech solution.

417
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,953
With that, we always try the zero base

418
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:52,080
or zero load human interactions
in order to make sure

419
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,794
that actually we achieve those outcomes

420
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:56,844
that actually we commit at the beginning.

421
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,433
So for us,

422
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,340
it's all about the software.

423
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,083
How do we deliver service
as software non-intrusive,

424
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,420
open, integrating multiple technologies,

425
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,070
integrated the systems and the investment

426
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,140
that actually the customer have done,

427
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,333
a micro agent architecture,

428
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,130
a two-way systems in order
to communicate and integrate

429
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,653
agentic worlds with traditional worlds,

430
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,250
and monetizing the
channel at the same time.

431
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,250
That's customer value empowered by AI.

432
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,455
So with that, let me show you
some of the demonstrations

433
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:38,733
that actually we have.

434
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:41,584
- Thank you.

435
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:44,550
Okay.

436
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,035
Yeah, just like Salvador said,

437
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,090
we're gonna see some of the demos

438
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,690
and how this multi-agent
architecture work a little bit

439
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,950
under the hood.

440
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,451
So, let's jump right to it.

441
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,660
(sighs deeply)

442
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,073
Okay. It's the first one.

443
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,820
- [Luana] Hello, Daniel. Thank
you for contacting Illumia.

444
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,800
My name is Luana, how
can I help you today?

445
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,940
Just a quick reminder.

446
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,043
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

447
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:11,520
- [Daniel] Thanks for the reminder, Luana.

448
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,250
But actually I'm not really
happy with my DirecTV service.

449
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,873
I'd like to cancel it, please.

450
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,630
- [Luana] I understand completely.

451
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,000
And I'm sorry to hear you're
thinking of leaving us.

452
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,710
I see you've been a
customer for three years

453
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,023
and have the premium package,
which includes sports,

454
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,240
movies, and series channels, correct?

455
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,403
What has changed in
your TV usage recently?

456
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,138
- [Daniel] Well, actually I'm
watching a lot more streaming

457
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:43,420
than what I used to do before.

458
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,900
- [Gustavo] So, we can see the
different agents interacting.

459
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,860
So like us, he said the account
manager sent an analyst.

460
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,693
- [Luana] I completely understand-

461
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:51,840
- The master one.
- Many customers

462
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,010
have told us the same thing.

463
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,612
The good news is that we
have more flexible options

464
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:56,400
that might fit your current needs better,

465
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,870
keeping what you enjoy most.

466
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,790
Tell me, do you still
watch sports channels

467
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,013
or do you use news programming a lot?

468
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,933
- [Daniel] Well, yeah, actually
I do watch a lot of sports

469
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:09,243
and news, a couple, sometimes I do.

470
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,753
- [Luana] Perfect.

471
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:22,620
I have a proposal that might interest you.

472
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,720
Since you've been a loyal
customer for three years,

473
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,850
I can offer you the
Essential Plus package,

474
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,830
which keeps all sports and news channels

475
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,560
for only $89.90 cents per month.

476
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,357
This represents saving of $39 monthly.

477
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,880
Additionally, I can apply
a special loyalty discount

478
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,710
of 20% for the next six months,

479
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,680
which would make the value $71.92.

480
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,703
What do you think?

481
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,840
- [Daniel] Yeah, that
sounds good actually.

482
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,263
Let's go with that then.
It makes sense for me.

483
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,270
- [Luana] Excellent choice.

484
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,470
I'm very happy to keep you with us

485
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,270
on a plan that makes more sense for you.

486
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,680
I'll process the change now.

487
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,870
The new Essential Plus package
with the loyalty discount

488
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,820
will be activated immediately
and you'll see the value

489
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,840
of $71.92 on your next
bill due on December 15th.

490
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,407
I'll send you a confirmation
email at customer@gmail.com

491
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:17,040
with all the details of the change

492
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
and the list of available channels.

493
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,580
Is that email correct?

494
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,700
- [Gustavo] Oh, that's
an example. Of course.

495
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,050
A pretty easy customer, right?

496
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,720
Not all the customers will
accept an offer like that.

497
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,120
But just to highlight,
you know, the multi-agents

498
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,843
and how they work together and the master

499
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:35,160
kind of decides what to
answer back to the customer.

500
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,530
And this is like an app we try to...

501
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,350
We did the video, so we thought
about doing the live demo,

502
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,162
but we were concerned that might not work

503
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:44,280
on this setup here.

504
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,780
So, we didn't know how it worked.

505
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,740
So, that's the first example.

506
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,722
The churn, very big problem
for some of these TV companies.

507
00:25:50,722 --> 00:25:53,850
And then, we're gonna see the second one.

508
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,683
Last one.

509
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,868
- Yeah, there is some delays,
you know, in the response

510
00:25:56,868 --> 00:25:57,860
just to show you.

511
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,550
So, we are going to show another demo

512
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,140
how it works in real-time in conversations

513
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,740
that actually we've record live.

514
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,170
- Hello, Daniel. Thank you
for contacting Illumia.

515
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,543
My name is Luana. How
may I help you today?

516
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,363
- [Daniel] Hi, Luana.

517
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:22,893
Can you check whether my
bill is correct, please?

518
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,200
- I can certainly check
that for you right away.

519
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
I already have your details loaded.

520
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,190
I'm accessing your billing history here.

521
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,020
Looking at this, the average value

522
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,400
of your last TV package
bills was around $189.90,

523
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,693
but this month it came
to $259.90, correct?

524
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,290
- [Daniel] That is correct.
So, why the sharp rise in cost?

525
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,060
- Perfect.

526
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,950
I understand your dissatisfaction

527
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,080
and I will explain how we will proceed.

528
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,877
I will register a dispute in confidence.

529
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:04,530
Meaning the credit for the difference

530
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,940
will be applied to your next bill,

531
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,270
so you are not disadvantaged
while we conduct the analysis.

532
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,320
During this process,

533
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,810
our billing team will
review the case in detail.

534
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,794
If the dispute is valid,

535
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,005
the credit will be permanently maintained.

536
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:18,298
If it is invalid, meaning if we identify

537
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:19,879
that the amount charged was correct,

538
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,923
the credit will be reversed
in the following bill.

539
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,943
- [Daniel] Okay.

540
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:28,023
Please proceed with
that then please, Luana.

541
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,770
- Perfect.

542
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,450
I have already registered
the dispute under #CL9458723.

543
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,656
The credit of $70 will
be automatically applied

544
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:42,757
to your next bill

545
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:45,017
and the analysis result
will be sent via email

546
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,250
within 10 business days.

547
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,690
And just a quick reminder.

548
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,550
What happens in Vegas stays?

549
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,923
Wait a minute, share it with everyone.

550
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,010
- Okay.

551
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,304
Yeah, just a little joke.

552
00:27:58,304 --> 00:27:59,137
- Yeah.

553
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:03,720
- The avatar, of course,
we're still thinking about it

554
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,950
as a separate channel.

555
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,090
It's not very cheap.

556
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,580
So, you have to really
think about where to use it

557
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,820
and how to use it for the
best of your business case,

558
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,620
but it's a possibility.

559
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,048
The backend is the same
for voice, for text,

560
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:17,310
or even for the avatar.

561
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,669
It's all the same.

562
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:21,150
And you kinda choose how to use it.

563
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,260
- So, we're trying with a customer

564
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,540
that actually wants to
do video conferencing.

565
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,180
So, video conferencing
services with avatar

566
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,285
is something possible
that actually you can do.

567
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:31,710
If there is a need, you
know, on a customer account.

568
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,270
For us, it's all the same.

569
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,170
You know, it's how you deliver
the message in that manner.

570
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,406
- That's right. Yeah.

571
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:42,150
And now we're gonna see a
little bit more of the solution

572
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,823
and a little bit what's
under the hood, as I said.

573
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,920
- Hello again.

574
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,150
I want to present to you

575
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,820
the NextGen operating
model and architecture

576
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,970
for the Customer Service
Transformation in Illumia

577
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,720
powered by Generative AI
and Agentic Experience.

578
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,240
A model that completely redefines

579
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,240
how customers interact,
how agents perform,

580
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,860
and how organizations learn
from every single conversation.

581
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,218
At the core, a living architecture
that connecting people,

582
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:15,000
data, and decisions in real-time.

583
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,970
Let's explore it layer by layer.

584
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,520
At the top, we have the control tower.

585
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,860
This is where everything comes together.

586
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,804
Operations are orchestrated,
performance is monitored,

587
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:28,860
and strategies are adjusted dynamically.

588
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,330
It's the strategic brain

589
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,019
that ensures every part of the
ecosystem works in harmony,

590
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:39,019
optimizing experience,
cost, and efficiency.

591
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,750
Next, we have the text,
digital and voice channels.

592
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,970
The front door of the experience.

593
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,790
Here live the AI agents
that engage customers

594
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,120
across web, app, chat, and IVR.

595
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,950
Each channel has its own tone,

596
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,174
personality, and context awareness.

597
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:59,430
Yet all of them connect to
the same intelligent core.

598
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,450
That core is the Gen AI engine, the brain.

599
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,990
This is where the
intelligence truly happens.

600
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,800
A multi-agent orchestrator
manages specialized models,

601
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,730
LLMs, SLMs, integrated
with the knowledge base,

602
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,785
AI content curation, and the
customer interaction database.

603
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:22,560
Every insight, every
response, every decision

604
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,562
is powered by real data
and continuous learning.

605
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:28,200
This engine doesn't just answer,

606
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,470
it thinks, predicts, and evolves.

607
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,930
This is the Micro Agents layer

608
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,240
where intelligence becomes modular.

609
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,880
Each micro agent is a specialist AI

610
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,679
built to solve complex challenges

611
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,170
from diagnostics to prediction.

612
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,810
They're reusable,
composable, and scalable,

613
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,950
turning every new use case
into an asset of intelligence.

614
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,043
While customers are served by AI agents,

615
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:56,130
human agents work side by
side with their copilot,

616
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,670
a single intelligent screen
that provides recommendations,

617
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,157
automates actions, and
anticipates the next best move.

618
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:06,960
Here, human intuition and
artificial intelligence

619
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,670
operate as one.

620
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,681
All information flows into
the Data Insights Hub.

621
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:14,880
This is where data becomes knowledge.

622
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,513
Every customer interaction
feeds analytics,

623
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:20,159
understanding patterns, resolution times,

624
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,500
satisfaction drivers.

625
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,110
And finally, at the foundation,

626
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,720
the Process Optimization Lab.

627
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,570
Here, intelligence turns into action.

628
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,020
Inefficiencies are identified,
processes are redesigned,

629
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,360
and new automations are deployed.

630
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,970
It's where the system learns from itself

631
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,150
and the cycle of improvement never stops.

632
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,710
Together, these layers form
a self-learning ecosystem,

633
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,470
an architecture where every conversation,

634
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,373
every agent, and every insight

635
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,682
contributes to a smarter, faster

636
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:56,553
and more human customer experience.

637
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,790
- Okay. Yeah.

638
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,914
So, one of the many important
parts of the architecture

639
00:32:03,914 --> 00:32:05,950
that we need actually to serve

640
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,249
is when you think about customer care,

641
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:10,410
there are a lot of spikes in the demand.

642
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,273
So, you're a constant, and
then a constant demand.

643
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,210
And then for example,

644
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,760
there's like an important game for DirecTV

645
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,550
and the spike on usage is like crazy.

646
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,308
So, we tried to use as most as we could,

647
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,305
serverless components.

648
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:29,133
Very few exceptions
for the telephony part.

649
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,310
Apart from that, everything
else is serverless.

650
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,840
And just a curiosity,

651
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,246
on the first week that
we went into production,

652
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:38,040
there was like a, I
think it was a Thursday

653
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,437
where they had a lot of
games of the national teams

654
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,731
in Latin America, Brazil,
Argentina, everything.

655
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:47,136
And we just basically
hit the max that we had

656
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:50,040
three times over at nine o'clock at night.

657
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,030
It was crazy.

658
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,307
And we were able to, using of course,

659
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:57,856
AWS serverless components
to support that spike.

660
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,730
We're just gonna see one more call

661
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,073
and then a little more of the components.

662
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,277
- [AI Assistant] Hello. Good afternoon.

663
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:05,130
(clears throat)

664
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,380
I'm your DirecTV virtual assistant.

665
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,643
Who am I speaking with?

666
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,390
- [Mark] Very good
morning. I'm Mark Smith.

667
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,922
- [AI Assistant] Hi Mr.
Smith. Pleasure to meet you.

668
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:18,030
Hm, I saw that you requested
a copy of your bill.

669
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,980
Is that what you need?

670
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,950
- [Mark] I was waiting for the bill

671
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,790
and it still hasn't arrived.

672
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,143
Can you send me a copy?

673
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,350
- [AI Assistant] Sure. I'm going
to sort this out right now.

674
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,603
Let me look up the information for you.

675
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,580
Perfect.

676
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,410
I found your account and confirm

677
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,530
that you have the Electronic
Bill Service activated.

678
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,570
The bills are sent to the registered email

679
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,950
that starts with the letters
MS and ends with @gmail.com.

680
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,720
Is that email correct?

681
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,220
- [Mark] Yes.

682
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,053
- [AI Assistant] Perfect.

683
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:51,660
I'm sending your bill to your
registered email right now.

684
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,830
One moment.

685
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,510
Done. I've sent it.

686
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,903
You should receive the bill in your inbox

687
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,600
in the next few minutes.

688
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,100
Is everything all right?

689
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,710
- [Mark] Yes. Perfect, thanks.

690
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,543
- [AI Assistant] Great.

691
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:03,883
Remember that from MiDirecTV,

692
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:06,702
you can download previous
bills if you need them.

693
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:09,390
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

694
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,951
- [Mark] No, everything's perfect.

695
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,950
Thank you very much for your help.

696
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,810
- [AI Assistant] It was
a pleasure to assist you.

697
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,733
Have an excellent day.

698
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,133
- Okay.

699
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,930
So, as I said, it's mostly
based on serverless components.

700
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,660
Our main database, it's OpenSearch.

701
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,420
And that's using that and Redis.

702
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,400
That's how we transfer
contact from one channel

703
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,289
to another to support true omnichannel.

704
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:41,922
So, since the behind the
scenes, the brain is the same.

705
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:44,970
So, if you're invoicing,
in the IVR, for example,

706
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,920
and you go to a text channel,

707
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,362
context completely transfer
to the text channels.

708
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:52,414
It just keeps talking to you on the text

709
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:55,024
as if you were talking on
the IVR in the first place.

710
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:57,540
And that's OpenSearch to help with that.

711
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,769
We use Amazon Transcribe
as a speech-to-text.

712
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,520
Very happy with that.

713
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,163
Our main component is the Amazon Bedrock,

714
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,740
which gave us a lot of
flexibility to change the LLMs.

715
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,284
So, we started with one,
and then we already have,

716
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:16,077
we're using four different
ones and we keep looking

717
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:21,077
and seeing what's coming to use the best.

718
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:25,790
What's works best for that
specific agent, right?

719
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,050
For the voice, most of the voice

720
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,540
that we heard actually
are from ElevenLabs.

721
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,873
So, the text-to-speech startup.

722
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,981
We also use as for our RAG,

723
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:41,610
the knowledge base from Bedrock as well.

724
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,720
And for the orchestration of
the agents, we use Versal AI.

725
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,810
So, the OpenSource using node.

726
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:53,810
And yeah, the guardrails
we, they're also in AWS.

727
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:55,653
We implemented them.

728
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,669
And this is just to show part of the,

729
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,890
some of the LLMs that we use.

730
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,460
So for a faster, simpler,
quicker response,

731
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,344
we use Amazon Nova, mostly Nova Lite.

732
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:10,200
We use a lot of Anthropic.

733
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,869
So, we use Sonnet 4, Sonnet
4.5, and the Haiku 4.5,

734
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:16,101
which is the fastest one.

735
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:18,503
Just came out about a month ago.

736
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:21,480
So, actually, we're
constantly on the lookout

737
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,965
for whatever's coming,

738
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:25,228
and to see whatever works best for us.

739
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:27,990
And of course, cost is also something

740
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,110
that we keep looking and
trying to see what's the best,

741
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,353
that works best for that use case, okay?

742
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:38,010
Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the next one

743
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,750
and pass it down back to Daniel.

744
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,520
Talk about the results.

745
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,870
- Okay. Thank you, Gustavo.

746
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,280
Let me talk about results, yeah?

747
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,866
And first of all, let
me talk about DirecTV

748
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:53,058
because we make a huge transformation.

749
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:55,530
When we started the transformation,

750
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,460
we used to have thousands of
CSRs around Latin America,

751
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,360
unionized in different countries

752
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,670
with more than 10 years
working as a CSR, yeah?

753
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,098
So, we had a very, very
challenging situation

754
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:09,303
at the beginning.

755
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,560
In rewriting the customer interaction,

756
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,756
the re:Invent of the
revolution that I mentioned,

757
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:22,110
first 12 months of implementing

758
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,425
the first pieces of our solution

759
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:29,425
with decreased the total
cost of ownership in 25%.

760
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,353
Yeah?

761
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:35,200
We are aiming to have
a 45% reduction on TCO

762
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,890
during the length of the entire problem.

763
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,890
So, when we, Lumi, talked about
our aspirations and results,

764
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,710
we are getting the
results right now, yeah?

765
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,529
Something that was very
important for the business

766
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:53,790
that DirecTV and Sky is
managing, registrations, yeah?

767
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,790
How the customers are being
registered in our systems.

768
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,789
When we implemented the
solution in the first weeks,

769
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:07,789
we increased three times the
success on the registration.

770
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,141
When we talk about how much we resolve

771
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:19,141
when the first four weeks,
we increase that into 84%.

772
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,041
So, these are results that matters.

773
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,880
We are not talking about aspirations.

774
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,300
We are talking about real
results that we are facing.

775
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,110
And you know, when we talk
about Gen AI, we talk about,

776
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,948
you know, in some cases
hallucinations, yeah?

777
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:37,174
We filter 97% of the interactions

778
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:39,330
without zero hallucinations.

779
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,070
We still have 3% that we need challenged

780
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,747
during the operational side that we need

781
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:48,028
to continue to work on on that dimension.

782
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:51,600
And obviously, something that is not.

783
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,920
We cannot decline even though
we want to get deficiencies

784
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,524
and reduce the total cost of ownership.

785
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:01,890
NPS is very important, yeah?

786
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,740
We had customers that were very frustrated

787
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,200
in the way that they interact with us

788
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,270
and we are improving that vis-a-vis

789
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,983
that we deliver the use
cases into the new paradigm.

790
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,730
And you know, let me talk about

791
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,470
two or three things
that for me is important

792
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,400
and I will ask also
Salva to join me on that.

793
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,850
What we are doing right
now? Commercial expansions.

794
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,940
We are expanding our portfolio of clients.

795
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,250
So, can we comment on what we are doing

796
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,311
in terms of commercial expansion
in our different markets?

797
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:42,582
- Actually we are serving
already 10 million customers.

798
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:44,910
You know, so we have a
client zero that actually

799
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,360
is one of the largest
tech medias in the region.

800
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,465
That means that actually, you
know, it's a proven platform.

801
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:53,340
It's something that
actually we are expanding

802
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,129
and talking about the
customers in all Latin America.

803
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,390
Indeed yesterday, you know,

804
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,880
we had a meeting with the AWS team as well

805
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,510
and they asked us when we're
going to America, to the US.

806
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,140
And it's mainly because
the purpose, isn't it?

807
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,090
This is applied technology.

808
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,160
If you think about where
everything is going,

809
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,410
you know, the other day the Blackstone CEO

810
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,000
was talking about where to invest.

811
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,180
Those are rule-based companies

812
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,750
that actually have domain expertise

813
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,733
supported with a large ecosystem,

814
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:22,800
working with technical partners

815
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,780
that actually what we're
doing in order to expand it.

816
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,870
So, all over Latin America At this stage,

817
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,810
we are only 18 months old as a company,

818
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,840
but with big dreams and big ambitions.

819
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,863
- Thank you, Salva.

820
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,970
Another two or three things that we'd like

821
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,044
to comment with you other
than the technical side,

822
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:46,803
the demonstrations, and what we are doing.

823
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
What we expect on our people?

824
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,660
We are working very hard.

825
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,790
You know, we have not
only a huge expertise

826
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,463
in terms of how to deal
with Gen AI at scale,

827
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:59,989
but we also have a huge expertise

828
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:04,980
in terms of operational processes.

829
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,507
And we expect three things.

830
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:10,215
I continue to mention
this in different places

831
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:13,950
when we talk about my
people in the region.

832
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,230
I expect people with passion.

833
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,583
I expect people with ambition
and great souls, yeah?

834
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:24,690
I don't expect any anymore
and any less of that.

835
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,690
And I think we are building
a team on that direction.

836
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,070
And on the other side,

837
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,400
we are building a team
of partners, you know?

838
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,430
And we, our partners become our friends

839
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,557
because we work so close
with them that sometimes

840
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:46,140
we are not seeing who is
in which company, yeah?

841
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,416
So, this is very important.

842
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:52,416
And this is for us a precondition
on what we are doing.

843
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:57,180
And we don't want to do only this.

844
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,550
We are working right now
in Latin America sometimes.

845
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,447
The other day a person
approached me and he said,

846
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:06,660
"Are you planning to stay
in Latin America only?"

847
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,170
No, we're not planning to
stay in Latin America only.

848
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,170
We want to keep our focus in
order to expand our company

849
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,180
in such a way that we can manage.

850
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Salva is managing the expansion in a very,

851
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,855
you know, in a way that we are
focusing on deliver results,

852
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:31,260
increasing the number of clients.

853
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,857
And this is very important for us, yeah?

854
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:35,778
And just for closing,

855
00:42:35,778 --> 00:42:39,390
and then I will open to
questions and comments.

856
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,044
I would like from you not only questions

857
00:42:41,044 --> 00:42:43,050
on what we are doing.

858
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,880
I would like to understand your visions

859
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,470
and your comments on that

860
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,763
because obviously all of you
are having similar challenges

861
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:52,800
in your companies.

862
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,663
But we have a purpose, yeah?

863
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,356
Obviously, we are a company.

864
00:42:57,356 --> 00:42:59,400
We want to gain money.

865
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,886
We want to expand our footprint

866
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:06,886
and we want to deliver what we promise.

867
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,520
But if you look into our
logo, we are Illumia, yeah?

868
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,190
Where empathy meets AI.

869
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,760
We want to be the co-pilot of human beings

870
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,208
at the time that they
interact and navigate

871
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:29,050
the different ecosystems
that they use for living

872
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,990
and the different experiences
that they are managing.

873
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,070
This is our purpose.

874
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,537
We are there. We would like to innovate.

875
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:42,292
We are not trying to be the ones imagining

876
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:47,057
how much the Gen AI or the
artificial intelligence

877
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,695
will impact our business.

878
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:52,258
We are ready to serve the way.

879
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:56,790
And how to deliver that and scale

880
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,347
into our business processes.

881
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,100
So, this is where we are.

882
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,130
Thank you for the patient
and to listen to us.

883
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,411
And I will open the stage
for questions and comments.

884
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:12,030
I want to receive also your
comments, yeah. Thank you.

885
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,930

886
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:13,931
