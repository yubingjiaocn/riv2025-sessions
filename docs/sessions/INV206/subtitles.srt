1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,590
Please welcome to the stage,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,130
Vice President of Search,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,130
observability and Cloud Ops at AWS

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,539
Nandini Romani.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,529
Hello everyone

6
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:11,859
and welcome

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,670
to Reinvent 2025.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,649
I'm excited to kick off the very first innovation talk of 2025,

9
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:23,260
and every year I look forward to this session myself,

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,229
my team,

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,219
because it motivates us

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,219
to look back on the year

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,989
that we've spent

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,259
on innovating and new adding new features so that we can address

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,580
cloud operations for all of you.

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,549
And we have been innovating with you

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,549
not just this past year

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,290
but we have been doing this

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,250
since the birth of the cloud

20
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,490
and in the last two decades

21
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,490
we've seen some major paradigm shifts in technology

22
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,490
ranging from virtualization

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,259
to containers to serverless and so on.

24
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:59,490
We've been on this journey with us.

25
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,209
And now

26
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,770
we are on to the next tectonic shift,

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,349
agentic AI.

28
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:07,129
We are living through

29
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,430
the next big transformation

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,290
and just like compute

31
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,550
databases and storage,

32
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,010
AI will be a foundational part

33
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:17,910
of everything you do.

34
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,680
AI has disrupted customer experiences to such a point

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,959
where our

36
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,559
end customers now expect

37
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,160
all of their end user experiences to be faster

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,199
and smarter

39
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,559
leveraging AI,

40
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,769
and I know many of our customers,

41
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,000
many of you here

42
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,180
have already deployed AI

43
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:41,000
or you are at least using some of it

44
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,459
to meet this demand.

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,279
Having said that,

46
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,800
we do know

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,339
that generative AI adoption varies

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,800
by industries,

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,050
by verticals,

50
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,080
and other,

51
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,519
you know,

52
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,300
specifications based on what you are working on

53
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,980
and according to one report from McKinsey,

54
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,980
88% of organizations

55
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,459
are already using AI in at least one business function.

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,440
More than a third of you

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,740
have either already fully scaled

58
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,320
or are scaling and deploying AI.

59
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,279
Another 1/3 of you

60
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,000
are running pilots,

61
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,899
and the rest of you are still experimenting.

62
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,220
And

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,199
many of you,

64
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:22,910
I think,

65
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,440
especially for those of you in highly regulated industries,

66
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,899
you might be moving with more caution and understandably so.

67
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,910
And this is why compliance and security

68
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,660
is super critical when it comes to Gen AI

69
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:39,550
and this is where

70
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,610
AWS can really help you.

71
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:45,059
We have done this for you when it comes to infrastructure for decades,

72
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:48,220
and we will do the same for you when it comes to AI.

73
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:52,080
So no matter where you are on this adoption curve,

74
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:53,149
we

75
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,339
want to meet you exactly where you are,

76
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,789
whether it comes to cloud

77
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,809
or AI.

78
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,520
As many of you know,

79
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,250
we at AWS love telling our stories through the voice of our customers,

80
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,300
and this time around,

81
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,210
I wanna kick off this talk

82
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,669
by introducing one of our customers

83
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:14,289
who uses AI

84
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,929
to enhance their fan experiences.

85
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,110
What is the PGA Tour?

86
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,229
It's a traveling technological masterpiece.

87
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:26,169
Spread across 200 acres

88
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,750
with over 120 cameras

89
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:31,330
and 36 radar trackers

90
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,250
collecting data on more than 32,000 shots,

91
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:36,789
every player,

92
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,190
every swing,

93
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,270
every week.

94
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,759
Using the power of AI

95
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:43,369
to give fans what they want.

96
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,919
Anytime,

97
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:47,289
anywhere.

98
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,270
Amazing.

99
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,419
So please welcome David Proven,

100
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,580
VP of digital architecture at PGA Tour,

101
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,169
to the stage.

102
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,779
David,

103
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:00,289
welcome.

104
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,449
Thank you.

105
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:11,300
Uh,
good morning guys.

106
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,419
Thanks so much for coming out

107
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,179
here today.

108
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,600
Excited to talk to you about what we do at the PGA Tour.

109
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,160
If you haven't heard of the PGA Tour,

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,059
the video hopefully has fixed that for you.

111
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,190
Please go and download the app immediately and rate it 5 stars,

112
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,260
we'd really appreciate that.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,510
Um,

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,010
golf is unlike any other sport you're going to consume on a week by week basis.

115
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:32,269
We don't play inside a set amount of white lines.

116
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,079
We don't play in the same stadiums.

117
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,899
We play in these amazing natural venues

118
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,179
throughout the world

119
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,200
that change,

120
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,359
that deal with weather.

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,790
And instead of like one field,

122
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,820
we have 150 acres of entirely playable area.

123
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,760
Each week,

124
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,339
156 players all playing asynchronously against each other.

125
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,040
Which leads to up to 14 golf balls at any

126
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,279
one point in the air being tracked in real time.

127
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,339
And like we said in the video,

128
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,390
over 31,000 shots

129
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,079
captured each week on the PGA Tour.

130
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:02,209
So what do we do with this

131
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,369
is what we're looking at with UTA.

132
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,140
How do we actually take AI solutions we'll talk about,

133
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,950
and I want to first talk about how we think about that operationally,

134
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:10,149
because at its core,

135
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,329
the PGA Tour is an operationalization

136
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:13,739
that runs golf tournaments.

137
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:14,630
That's what we do.

138
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,198
Week in,

139
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,630
week out,

140
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,309
we are running golf tournaments throughout North America,

141
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:18,709
some other parts of the world,

142
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,250
and we are building,

143
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:20,910
installing,

144
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,600
running,

145
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,190
tearing up,

146
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,070
putting back down again.

147
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,160
We are an operations company at our core.

148
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,649
So we approach AI,

149
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,089
we think operationally first.

150
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,649
How do we score and validate things that happen in real time?

151
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,489
If we're not first,

152
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,690
we're last in golf.

153
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:35,730
How do we keep a human in the loop at the right point in time?

154
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,390
And everyone talks about like secop ship left,

155
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:39,230
DevOps ship left.

156
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,269
We took operational thinking and shifted that left.

157
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:41,929
From the beginning,

158
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:44,750
how can we approach operational thinking and what we do?

159
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,040
And what we built.

160
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,739
Was this,

161
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,420
which is our AI shot commentary system.

162
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,459
For those of you that don't know,

163
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,670
we provide a product each week on our digital platforms called Torcast.

164
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:57,769
Torcast is a full 3D rendering of a shot tracked golf course.

165
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,660
People spend between 30 to 60 minutes in this

166
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,239
experience is what our most engaged platforms that we build

167
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:03,839
upon.

168
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,119
And for us,

169
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,700
we really wanted to build a

170
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,980
commentary system for me in particular,

171
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,130
that didn't just tell you what was happening,

172
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,040
but told you why it was relevant,

173
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,260
why it mattered.

174
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,910
It's really great to say Isaac scored a goal,

175
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,000
but not say any cost 125 million,

176
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,429
which is the interesting fact that goes with it,

177
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,980
right?

178
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,510
So our commentary is generated in two elements.

179
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:24,429
We generate a fact.

180
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,779
Scotty Scheffler hit the ball 175 yards,

181
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,070
he is 4 ft from the pin,

182
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,420
and then we add context into that system.

183
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,589
He has a 98% chance of making this putt for a birdie,

184
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,779
and will end up in 3rd position and leadable result,

185
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,869
which will move him above the FedEx cut line.

186
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,209
And that is really taking a point in time

187
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,309
and making it relevant to our fans.

188
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,450
And all of this is powered by our cloud operation and how we build it.

189
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,250
We're going to walk you through how that system works.

190
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,859
Firstly,

191
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:52,579
we talked about at the beginning,

192
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,929
there's those radars.

193
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,700
There's a golf course collection system where we're literally gathering.

194
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,420
Tons of data,

195
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,809
like terabytes of data each week off the golf course.

196
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,529
All of that folds into our cloud-based scoring system,

197
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,339
which is doing coordinate realization.

198
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,660
It's working out which player hit it,

199
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:08,559
where did it go,

200
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,459
it's updating statistics in real time,

201
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,820
what's their new strokes gained value,

202
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:12,619
what's their new

203
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,160
statistical values.

204
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,010
We then built on top of that,

205
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,839
our AI shot commentary system.

206
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,489
And what this does is every shot on the golf court is ingested in real time.

207
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,779
We analyze 72 million statistical records to find the most irrelevant one.

208
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,809
And then present that back over to the short commentary system

209
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,190
in Torcast.

210
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,420
And while that left to right flow is super

211
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,380
exciting and we're really proud that it works,

212
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,829
what really underpins it

213
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,890
is the operational dashboard underneath.

214
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,739
How do we know it works?

215
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,929
How are we sure

216
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:43,950
that it's operating fine each week on the PGA Tour?

217
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,339
So we're using synthetics,

218
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,350
we're using insights,

219
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,269
we're using alarms,

220
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,089
log analysis

221
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,950
to give our operations team,

222
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,269
which are really the beating heart of what we do at the tour,

223
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,010
confidence that it works.

224
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,299
There is not a better feeling in the world

225
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
than when the golfer hits that first tee shot at some

226
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,980
ungodly time in the morning cos we start golf at first light

227
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:04,269
to see everything flow through the system and work.

228
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,279
It's a really powerful feeling when it works

229
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,579
and a mildly terrifying feeling when it doesn't work.

230
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,130
So let's talk about the cloud Watch dashboard

231
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,089
that powers the AI shock commentary system,

232
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,619
and we're gonna zoom into some elements here to

233
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,700
help you understand how we're taking these AI problems,

234
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:18,660
scoring validation,

235
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:19,579
human in the loop,

236
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,279
and production first thinking and actually realizing those.

237
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,279
First one I'll show you is our

238
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,489
validation score.

239
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:26,760
So for those of you who grew up in England,

240
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,399
which is me,

241
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,719
we have this concept in driving tests of like minor faults and major faults.

242
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,539
Our scoring is analyzed against this,

243
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,159
when the commentary's generated.

244
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,200
Is this a minor issue or a major issue?

245
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,599
If it's just a minor issue,

246
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,280
we'll push it through,

247
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,419
maybe we'll regenerate it.

248
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,909
The blue line is showing you here are things with zero errors,

249
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,380
they went straight through the UI,

250
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,780
no human involvement.

251
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,479
The orange is one error,

252
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,200
it's usually a stylistic language thing,

253
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,150
so it still goes through.

254
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,190
Anything more than that,

255
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,200
it goes into this review,

256
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,239
we don't put it in the UI,

257
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,099
we hold it.

258
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,400
About 98% of our commentaries go through without further involvement.

259
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,619
When this doesn't work,

260
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:02,570
we can then see what those look like.

261
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,090
In a dashboard video again,

262
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,520
the top one is showing you commentaries that for some reason failed validation.

263
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,650
The score was wrong,

264
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,789
the par was wrong,

265
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,849
the yardage is wrong,

266
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:12,719
something like that.

267
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,799
Underneath my favorite one cos it sits there and ticks through when they work,

268
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,270
the commentaries that are going through

269
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:18,900
that you can see on the platform.

270
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,179
And now I wanna show you what happens when it doesn't go well,

271
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,580
which does happen sometimes too.

272
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,559
So the first chart on the left

273
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,780
is really just a standard LLM's timing,

274
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,359
we like

275
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,179
flat lines,

276
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,500
things should look consistent timing.

277
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,590
The SQSS one is uh Bank of Utah a month ago.

278
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,880
We had not had an event on the PGA Tour for about 1 month,

279
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,979
we had the Ryder Cup.

280
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,440
No real PGA Tour events after Procore.

281
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,020
Scoring starts up

282
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,700
and that moment in your pit of your stomach when someone doesn't work,

283
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,020
no shot commentary.

284
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,320
And this is a sponsored feature for us,

285
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,210
it's high profile.

286
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:52,820
At that point in our traditional model,

287
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,219
you go into debug logging,

288
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,260
how do I analyze this,

289
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,299
how do I pull this out?

290
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,599
How do I get the developer around to go look at this?

291
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,599
Because we'd shifted that thinking far left,

292
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,460
we're able to pick up our SQSS

293
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:05,179
queue and realize very quickly,

294
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,690
we're getting commentaries,

295
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,780
we're not generating them,

296
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,460
so our queue is not being processed.

297
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,840
So as opposed to traditionally what's taken is like maybe

298
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
a full day to kind of dig into it,

299
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,159
get the right person,

300
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:14,840
get them online,

301
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,700
get it fixed.

302
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,400
The first line support team just restarted the cluster.

303
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:21,109
And then my favorite line in cloud watch is when it goes straight up,

304
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,619
cos that means you've fixed it.

305
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,099
You see everything kind of sync back together and going in parallel.

306
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,239
So again,

307
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,080
we then learn from this,

308
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,239
we put in new metrics,

309
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:30,000
we put in synthetics,

310
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,179
we're now sending control messages through SQS

311
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,479
so we can keep things operating,

312
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,679
we learn and we get better.

313
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,739
We're not perfect.

314
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,460
But it's one of those things of like

315
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,760
real life happens.

316
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,070
How do you respond to it?

317
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,000
In our sport,

318
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,390
if we don't fix it immediately,

319
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,880
the backup just builds.

320
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,640
It just builds there,

321
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,179
those golf shots keep coming.

322
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,580
So the quicker we can resolve it,

323
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,359
the better for us.

324
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:50,909
So at the results of this,

325
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,780
like we talked about 31,000 shots,

326
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,809
and each of those shots costs us a penny

327
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,109
to generate for shot commentary.

328
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,070
That's the bedrock fees,

329
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,229
that's all the stuff that goes with it,

330
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,270
the sky watch fees,

331
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:00,690
1 penny per shot.

332
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,580
It's really important for us that we can do this thing cost effectively.

333
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,570
We've also added zero extra humans to monitor this system.

334
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,570
It's full.

335
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,109
It's folded in with our traditional operational support team.

336
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,869
No extra bodies,

337
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,900
we just added dashboards,

338
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,890
alerts,
and reporting

339
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:15,229
into our existing setup.

340
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,179
It's all in CloudWatch.

341
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:17,099
We use that already.

342
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:19,559
Again,
apart from that issue a month ago,

343
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,989
the system's been highly available.

344
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,289
My favorite thing on a Thursday morning is to watch everything just work.

345
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,919
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

346
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:26,969
And when it doesn't,

347
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,919
it sucks.

348
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,630
But

349
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,489
fortunately,

350
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:29,849
pretty good.

351
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:30,369
And then like I said,

352
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,369
with that problem resolution,

353
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,130
a much quicker response time for us

354
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,190
when we dashboard.

355
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,989
Constructively,

356
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:36,859
thoughtfully,

357
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,530
and we involve the developers in it,

358
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,950
in that process right at the beginning,

359
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:41,710
kind of move that decision tree down.

360
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:43,630
But we're not done,

361
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,729
um,

362
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:46,830
we are relentless in trying to do better.

363
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:51,489
And we're currently working with AWS on piloting how we can use AI investigations

364
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,190
to really help us change

365
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:54,849
how we do log analysis.

366
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,849
So for those of you doing this today,

367
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:57,820
probably a traditional thing,

368
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,140
you're logging out Jason objects,

369
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,690
logging out error codes.

370
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,500
Quite often that has to go to developer,

371
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,559
like,
hey Steve,

372
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:04,580
we've got this error code,

373
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:05,140
what does this mean?

374
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,799
Or it's a giant knowledge-based document I've got to fill in and understand.

375
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,119
We're actually playing now with,

376
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,489
what if we log the error message as a human readable string.

377
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,979
Hey,
I failed the ingest because the scorecard isn't up to date.

378
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,190
And we actually log out at the developer level.

379
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,500
The developer knows what the issue is because they wrote the code

380
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:21,820
right out as a log statement,

381
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
the actual English transaction,

382
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,619
because it turns out LLM's

383
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,520
really,

384
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,219
really good at summarizing that and telling you what the issue is.

385
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,789
So what that's allowing us to do as opposed to when an issue comes up,

386
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,119
we've got to bubble up through level 1,

387
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,640
level 2,

388
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,039
level 3,

389
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,960
and you get to the guy at level 3 that fixes it in 5 minutes,

390
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,640
but took you

391
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,859
an hour to get there.

392
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,580
Able to push that decision making way down.

393
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,260
And help those guys in the first line,

394
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,239
the guys that have really taken the bullets on the front line

395
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,960
and let them move it quickly.

396
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,520
So as excited as I am with the stuff we've done

397
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,119
to date with AWS,

398
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,479
I'm actually more excited

399
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,979
for where we're gonna go next in this operational journey that we're,

400
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,250
we're doing on the PGA Tour.

401
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:55,900
And with that,

402
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,979
I will hand you back to Nandini.

403
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:06,830
Thank you David.

404
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,530
It's truly inspiring to see PGA Tour,

405
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:10,909
just like many of you

406
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,940
approach AI with the same customer obsession that we have here at AWS

407
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,669
now.
2025 is the year

408
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,309
when agentic AI moves from experimentation

409
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:24,450
into production.

410
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,960
These agents no longer just respond,

411
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,849
they think

412
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,719
they act and they even

413
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,340
make decisions on your behalf.

414
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,070
So

415
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,710
The now while agents certainly help you with

416
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,950
creating efficiency and making things a lot simpler,

417
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,429
it has also created

418
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,809
certain operational challenges.

419
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,250
Let's think about it.

420
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,229
First is trust and safety.

421
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,869
Visibility into your AI agent behavior

422
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,400
is super critical.

423
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,450
Think about,

424
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,789
let's say a customer service agent that you've created

425
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:04,320
and a customer reaches out regarding some billing issue.

426
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,659
Now the agent

427
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,580
in a matter of seconds

428
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,390
makes several decisions.

429
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,200
Does it handle the matter on its own?

430
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,539
Does it escalate to a human specialist?

431
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,419
Now the question when it comes to observability

432
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,659
is no longer

433
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,380
did the agent work.

434
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,380
We all know the agent works so great,

435
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,119
but the question becomes

436
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,320
how and why did the agent choose to handle the situation

437
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:29,380
the way it did.

438
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,419
Second,

439
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,739
operational complexity is only increasing.

440
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,679
You are now managing microservices.

441
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,479
In addition,

442
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,479
now you have distributed agents.

443
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,099
You have event driven architectures,

444
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,679
and on top of that

445
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,780
you are managing all of this

446
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:48,700
across

447
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,679
dozens,

448
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,340
hundreds of accounts

449
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,989
and multiple regions.

450
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,500
You want AI to be able to help you

451
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,739
not just with applications

452
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,820
but also

453
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,520
making operations more efficient.

454
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:03,869
Third

455
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:05,330
data explosion

456
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,609
we have seen this over the last several years

457
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:09,770
and now

458
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,929
your AI agents work 24/7

459
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:13,890
and

460
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,210
they handle thousands of customer requests

461
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,530
every hour

462
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,929
and each of these requests is generating

463
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,169
an immense amount of telemetry

464
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,489
throughout the day.

465
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:27,750
That's not just more data.

466
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:28,729
That is,

467
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,409
it's exponentially more surface area that you now have to both monitor

468
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,450
and secure.

469
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,789
So we have been working

470
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,530
to make these things simpler for you

471
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,590
so that you we handle the heavy lifting

472
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,190
of cloud operations.

473
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,169
Now as complexity grows our mission at AWS stays the same.

474
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,219
We simplify cloud operations for each and every one of you

475
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,900
at AWS

476
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,570
we pioneered cloud computing,

477
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:00,580
but we are not stopping there.

478
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,159
Through every shift in technology

479
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,210
we have always been there for you,

480
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,039
removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting

481
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,960
and building new capabilities

482
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,440
that work well together.

483
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,299
And we will continue

484
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,640
to do that

485
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,440
whether you are all in on AWS

486
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,729
or on in hybrid environments or even multi-cloud.

487
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:25,640
Whether you're using autonomous agents

488
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,169
or still deploying traditional microservices,

489
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,250
we handle operations for every one of you.

490
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,919
This is our commitment.

491
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:35,070
So today

492
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,559
I want to show you

493
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:37,419
exactly

494
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,760
how we are delivering

495
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,789
across these three pillars.

496
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,729
First,

497
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:45,900
monitoring and trusting your agentic AI applications.

498
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,679
When an AI acts.

499
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,059
It does so autonomously.

500
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:54,849
You need visibility into what the agent is doing and the why behind it.

501
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:55,859
Second,

502
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,039
operating smarter with AI.

503
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,929
As complexity grows,

504
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,080
we want AI to help you with your operations.

505
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,098
Third,

506
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,540
simplifying overall operations,

507
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:07,880
and I'm talking about

508
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:09,280
traditional

509
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,239
observability for

510
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,300
databases,

511
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,098
containers,

512
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,260
and so on and so forth,

513
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,300
not just as it relates to AI.

514
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,550
So let's dive into the first pillar.

515
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,790
Like I mentioned earlier,

516
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,189
you are now have agents that are smarter and taking actions on their own

517
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,530
on your behalf.

518
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,310
So picture,

519
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:30,510
let's go back to the same

520
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,030
chatbot who's handling customer support issues.

521
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,030
Your agent now is making decisions

522
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:38,630
in a matter of seconds

523
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,689
which you may or may not agree with.

524
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:41,650
So

525
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,069
agents are right a lot we know this

526
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,020
however,

527
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,790
they are not always right.

528
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,150
What if an agent makes the wrong call,

529
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,079
wrong decision,

530
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,719
and turns away your customer?

531
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,319
Agents,

532
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:59,969
this will impact not just your end user experience but also your brand reputation.

533
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:04,430
This is why observability is now the control plane

534
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,410
for your trust,

535
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,449
safety,

536
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,890
and accountability.

537
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:09,719
Next,

538
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,910
traditional monitoring tools

539
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,829
can tell you that the chatbot responded to

540
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,430
your customer request in let's say 2 seconds,

541
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,280
and it did so with a status code of like 200 maybe.

542
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:24,140
That's great so you know the agent is working,

543
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,010
it's running,

544
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,209
but it doesn't tell you the why behind what decisions the agent is taking.

545
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,130
AI agents can create

546
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,969
hidden issues

547
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,209
that legacy tools cannot see.

548
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,469
Now don't get me wrong,

549
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:39,880
performance metrics are always important.

550
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:40,890
You saw them in,

551
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,430
uh,
David's dashboards.

552
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,739
You're gonna see them every day,

553
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,199
and they're super critical.

554
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,030
However,

555
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,569
they do not give you the entire picture

556
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,750
when it comes to AI.

557
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,729
So in October

558
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,089
we announced the general availability

559
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,930
of generative AI observability

560
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,109
in CloudWatch.

561
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:00,410
This

562
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,500
feature helps you monitor,

563
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,589
troubleshoot,

564
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,010
and optimize

565
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,130
your AI

566
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,099
applications and workloads.

567
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,229
It simplifies a few things for you.

568
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,089
First,

569
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,170
you need to make zero code changes.

570
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,250
This is because

571
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,300
we leverage open telemetry,

572
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,609
which allows instrumentation and makes everything super simple

573
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,160
if you haven't tried it yet.

574
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,569
It also allows you to use any agent development framework of your choice.

575
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,459
You can use strands agents.

576
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,569
You can use lang chain,

577
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,390
land graph,

578
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,589
or Crew AI,

579
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,619
and many more.

580
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,119
Or

581
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:40,150
you can also choose to instrument manually by yourself

582
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,239
using the Open telemetry SDK.

583
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,170
Second,

584
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,589
this works no matter where you choose to host your agents.

585
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,550
You could choose,

586
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,170
for example,

587
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,670
Amazon Bedrock Agent Core.

588
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:53,750
Or

589
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,880
self-managed Kubernetes hybrid environments,

590
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,709
multi-cloud,

591
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:59,010
it just works.

592
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,229
You get complete visibility

593
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,430
out of the box

594
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,910
into latency,

595
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,329
token usage,

596
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,550
and performance

597
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,109
across all of your AI workloads.

598
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,260
Third,

599
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,209
you can pinpoint issues anywhere in your AI stack.

600
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,479
So let's go back to that billing issue we were talking about,

601
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,099
right?

602
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,369
with end to end prompt tracing,

603
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,060
you can now trace

604
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,660
that single customer

605
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,420
from the initial complaint that they made

606
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:29,079
through every model invocation,

607
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:29,920
every tool.

608
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:31,145
Tool execution

609
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:33,625
every knowledge based query

610
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:34,785
all the way

611
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:37,604
to the final response from the agent

612
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:38,974
to your end customer.

613
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:39,854
Think about it.

614
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,704
That's a series of events that you can track

615
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,285
no matter where you choose to host your agent.

616
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,864
Now you can see exactly

617
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:51,005
how the deci agent made the decisions it did,

618
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:53,145
so you have entire visibility

619
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,364
into the decision tree that the agent is taking.

620
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:58,989
So,

621
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,630
however,

622
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,469
we know that agents do not operate in a silo.

623
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,729
They integrate with other services,

624
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,020
applications,

625
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,369
and other dependencies across your entire estate

626
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,969
which would be across multiple accounts and regions.

627
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,189
So when it comes to troubleshooting,

628
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,849
now it's challenging to understand

629
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:22,400
where all of these resources are and how are they interacting with each other.

630
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,989
That's why we launched CloudWatch Application map.

631
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:27,349
So

632
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,400
this requires no manual configuration.

633
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,849
Application map

634
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:34,079
will automatically discover

635
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:36,650
and organize all of your services,

636
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:37,890
including

637
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:39,790
uninstrumented services.

638
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:40,910
I think this is key.

639
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,760
Uh,

640
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,640
and the map organizes it based on exactly how you operate,

641
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,219
based on your application,

642
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,589
your teams,

643
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,699
and even your business units.

644
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,349
It correlates and analyzes metrics,

645
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:53,739
logs,

646
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:54,640
and traces

647
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,180
and offers audit findings that simplify

648
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,459
your root cause analysis.

649
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,979
Now

650
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,290
when your customer service agent that we talked about,

651
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,280
when it's responding slowly,

652
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,939
you will not only know

653
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,979
which service is degrading,

654
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,140
but you will also know why it's doing so.

655
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:16,189
So

656
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,050
with that we are now at an exciting part of this presentation

657
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,290
where you actually get to see this in action.

658
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,790
I'd like to invite to the stage someone,

659
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,800
someone you have all known for like over 20 years.

660
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,630
Please put your hands together

661
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,839
for Jeff Barr,

662
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,430
VP at AWS and chief evangelist.

663
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,270
Jeff,

664
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,329
come on stage and show us how it works.

665
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:39,479
Thanks.

666
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,540
Alright,

667
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,180
great to be here.

668
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,680
I almost broke my leg coming in,

669
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,959
but I'm alive and well,

670
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:45,939
so happy to

671
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,140
report that.

672
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:47,680
Um,

673
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,979
it's been super fun to work with this team to

674
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,160
prepare this content,

675
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:51,739
and

676
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,430
to me I'm thinking about this a little bit,

677
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,040
and it's

678
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,800
really kind of this idea from

679
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,420
agents as kind of a cool thing that we could think about to

680
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,430
now we're building them,

681
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,089
now they're an essential part of our,

682
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,160
our business.

683
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:06,854
And now they're so important we actually need to monitor them and maintain them and

684
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:08,805
make sure that they're working the way we

685
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:09,604
expect them.

686
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,025
So we,

687
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,675
we see these agents going from,

688
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:13,685
from proof of concept to production.

689
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:16,244
They connect with your customers 24/7.

690
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,064
So you have to actually monitor them,

691
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:18,964
maintain,

692
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,645
make sure you're actually maintaining

693
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:21,665
your customer trust.

694
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,045
And what I want to do today is

695
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:25,704
show you a bit about how that actually works.

696
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,760
So let's take an example of a pet clinic.

697
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,410
The pet clinic is growing,

698
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,280
it's expanding its digital footprint,

699
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,020
they've got medical appointments,

700
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,420
nutrition recommendations,

701
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,119
and more.

702
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,219
And these customers are pretty demanding.

703
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:41,319
They want a near real-time experience.

704
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:44,849
They want instant confirmation when they're booking an appointment at 2:00 a.m.

705
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,060
for their sick pet.

706
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,439
So deliver,

707
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,520
to deliver on this,

708
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,550
these plans or these expectations,

709
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,079
they've got 3 agents.

710
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,979
They put all these agents into use this year.

711
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,339
And they run on completely different hosts

712
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,810
serving different functions.

713
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,819
They've got a customer facing orchestration agent.

714
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,189
It's running on Bedrock Agent Corp using the crew AI SDK.

715
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:07,880
This is the front door.

716
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,869
It hits the customer inquiries,

717
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,119
routes requests,

718
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,339
and coordinates with the other agents.

719
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,099
And second,

720
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,989
the appointment scheduling agent.

721
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,880
This one is built with lang chain.

722
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,819
It runs on

723
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,819
EKS

724
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,839
and it manages real-time availability.

725
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,319
It handles cancellations,

726
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,550
it sends reminders,

727
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:29,300
and it integrates with the clinic's existing scheduling systems.

728
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,739
Then there's a third one.

729
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,199
This one's a nutrition recommendation agent.

730
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,949
It analyzes pet health data and it recommends supplements,

731
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,890
and it's hosted on Bedrock Agent Corp

732
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,369
using the Strands SDK.

733
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,959
This one reviews medical history,

734
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,599
it

735
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,099
looks at,

736
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,510
looks at and considers breed specific needs,

737
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,819
and it makes personalized product recommendations.

738
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:49,939
So,

739
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:51,280
we've got our 3 separate agents,

740
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,479
and they're here to help this pet clinic scale.

741
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,770
They handle thousands of simultaneous customer interactions.

742
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,079
They make real-time adjustments based on appointment availability

743
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,900
and health data.

744
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,989
But there's a real challenge.

745
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,160
The operations and the AI teams,

746
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,479
they need visibility across all three agents,

747
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,920
and we saw how they're built on,

748
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,900
on different environments and platforms

749
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,910
to know not just that the agent is running.

750
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,880
They need to know that this agent is actually

751
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,739
making good decisions and delivering a consistent customer experience.

752
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,510
So we want to help to get you observability access across your agents,

753
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,619
across any framework,

754
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:27,329
and anywhere you might want to host.

755
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,180
And of course we want to make it easy for you to start.

756
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,439
And so we set this up,

757
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:34,329
so there's the implementation actually takes just two steps.

758
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,800
So first,

759
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,660
you auto instrument your application,

760
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,479
you install the AWS Distro for Open Telemetry SDK,

761
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,099
which we call ADOT for short.

762
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,319
And second,

763
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:47,239
you enable transaction search in the CloudWatch console,

764
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,390
just one click,

765
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,709
and this lets you receive telemetry from that A.SDK

766
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,349
and it gets sent to the CloudWatch OTLP endpoints.

767
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:56,790
So real easy.

768
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,050
So once instrumented,

769
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,430
you get unified visibility that goes across

770
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,069
your complete AI fleet,

771
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,170
no matter where you build and no no matter where you host them.

772
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,500
You can see your entire fleet at a glance,

773
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,319
you can see runtime sessions,

774
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,680
runtime invocations,

775
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:13,520
CPU consumption,

776
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,010
what we can think of as the,

777
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,479
the,

778
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:20,260
the curated set of golden signals to know that your Gen AI is working as you expect.

779
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,420
But we don't stop at just the high-level dashboards.

780
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,790
You can dive deep into the individual agents to see sessions,

781
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:27,979
see traces,

782
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:29,119
and aerometrics.

783
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,180
So for each of these agents,

784
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,750
you get again these golden curated metrics that

785
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,380
are specifically designed for your G AI workloads.

786
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,160
For example,

787
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,459
things like throttling rates and error rates,

788
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,619
and the idea is these golden rates,

789
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,250
golden metrics will help you to understand if the agent is performing

790
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,569
as you expect.

791
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,560
Now

792
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,089
beyond the metrics in the dashboard,

793
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,339
you can also drill down to view all sessions for any agent.

794
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,290
Lots of great detail here.

795
00:26:58,579 --> 00:26:59,479
Here's an example.

796
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,890
You click into a session,

797
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,359
you see all the traces,

798
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,260
you double click on any trace to look at the full trajectory map.

799
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:07,579
Your nutrition service,

800
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:09,369
calling medical history processing,

801
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,260
checking pet types and inventory,

802
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:11,900
so you,

803
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,359
you see exactly how the requests flow through your system.

804
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,339
So let's say you see an error in the trajectory map.

805
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:23,410
Well,
you just click on it to see exactly what went wrong.

806
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:24,569
So in this case,

807
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:27,239
the nutrition service can't find the pet type,

808
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,180
and the agent expected a rabbit,

809
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,359
but the data for the rabbit wasn't actually there.

810
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,920
And so we can actually see the failure point right away,

811
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
right there in situ

812
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,500
in the code.

813
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,089
That's not all.

814
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,790
You can also drill into the chat span and you can see the entire exchange.

815
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:45,430
You can see the system prompts,

816
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,619
the user prompts,

817
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:47,869
and the tool messages,

818
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,540
all the details you really want.

819
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,750
You see exactly how the customer experienced your agent,

820
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,920
and you can validate the error message,

821
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:58,910
so you get full visibility into how your AI agent is actually doing the reasoning.

822
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Now one really important aspect of this,

823
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,880
if,
if your users share some sensitive information like names and emails,

824
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,400
you can mask that and you can protect that PAI

825
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,400
by simply turning on the Cloudwatch data protection policies,

826
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,459
and you'll see that that's masked out right there in the

827
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,739
in the log info.

828
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,739
Alright,

829
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:18,729
so maybe you're thinking,

830
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,010
this is great for my agents,

831
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:22,150
but these agents don't work in isolation,

832
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,880
they're part of a bigger picture.

833
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,780
So they're calling microservices,

834
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,119
they're querying databases,

835
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,599
they're maybe pulling real-time data from across all of your infrastructure.

836
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,359
And so for example,

837
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,209
your appointment agent needs some payment processing,

838
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,930
your nutrition agent needs inventory systems,

839
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,839
your orchestration agent needs all of them working together.

840
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:45,520
So you need visibility into the entire operational health of your application,

841
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,910
and because when one of these things fails,

842
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,030
your whole agent fails,

843
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,000
and when one of those agents fails,

844
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,280
your customer experience fails.

845
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,920
So there's a,

846
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,520
there's a cascading reaction there.

847
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,689
So this is where the CloudWatch Application

848
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:02,010
Performance monitoring or APM comes in.

849
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,510
We help you troubleshoot the operational

850
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,209
health across your entire application stack.

851
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,819
So a lot of cool stuff happens here.

852
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,599
We automatically discover your application topology,

853
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,709
both the instrumented and the uninstrumented applications,

854
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,930
and you can also just progressively,

855
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,160
as time permits,

856
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,250
add instrumentation where it matters the most,

857
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,689
all with just a few clicks.

858
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,439
So let's go back to our pet clinic example.

859
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,300
Let's imagine customers are experiencing some issues with the nutrition agent

860
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:32,420
where the agent fails to recommend supplements for a pet rabbit.

861
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,239
The agent appears to be running,

862
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,849
but something in the underlying infrastructure is broken,

863
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:40,130
and you are on call.

864
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,229
You need to find it fast.

865
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,829
So you kickstart your troubleshooting directly from

866
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,540
the online pet care business unit,

867
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,510
or you can go with any other grouping based

868
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,829
on how you organize your services into production,

869
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,170
development environments and and

870
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,290
and so forth.

871
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:56,069
So you dive in

872
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,930
and you,
you drill down to all the applications within that business unit

873
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,689
and you filter by the failing services to highlight exactly what's broken.

874
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,599
You select the,

875
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,849
the,
the failing pet clinic front end,

876
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:10,250
and you see what we call the complete blast radius.

877
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,250
Sounds kind of dangerous,

878
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:12,329
but that's the phrase we often use,

879
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:13,319
the blast radius.

880
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,410
And we trace the failure from the front-end service to

881
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,670
the visit service and finally down to the payment processing.

882
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:20,890
So,
so each hop,

883
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,650
and hops,

884
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,089
these are hops not related to the rabbits we talked about earlier,

885
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,949
but each hop

886
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,650
shows you exactly where the request failed and why.

887
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,390
So you get all,

888
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:30,670
all that flow within your,

889
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,790
your topology.

890
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:34,640
So next step,

891
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,680
the fixing issues is even easier with

892
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,599
automatically generated operational audits for your applications,

893
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,660
and the this built-in view actually correlates monitoring,

894
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,819
monitoring data across your infrastructure.

895
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,500
You get a head start on root cause analysis

896
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,099
before you even begin

897
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:51,140
your manual investigation.

898
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:55,030
So we think about this,

899
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,109
your application needs more than just operational health monitoring.

900
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,430
You need to actually understand,

901
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,699
and what I've shown you today,

902
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:01,969
the actual

903
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,689
um end user impact.

904
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,930
So that's where the real user monitoring and the synthetics come in.

905
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,000
We connect the the real user monitoring,

906
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:09,849
which we call RM,

907
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,810
and the synthetics to your application performance data,

908
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,670
and you get a complete view across all the layers,

909
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:18,099
from the infrastructure health to the agent performance,

910
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,209
to the actual customer experience.

911
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,829
So as you as

912
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:24,239
innovate with these agents,

913
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,290
and as I can,

914
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,609
as I'm talking to a lot of you,

915
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:29,550
realizing you're making them totally essential to the way you are

916
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,589
innovating and moving your business forward,

917
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,069
we're going to innovate right there alongside you.

918
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,560
And what we've shown you today,

919
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,410
just the beginning,

920
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:37,810
we've got a lot more queued up to show

921
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,869
you the rest of this hour and throughout Reinvent,

922
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,770
we're going to continue to work with you and build

923
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,630
the great tools that you're going to need to succeed.

924
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:44,530
Thanks so much,

925
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,630
and I'll be back in a bit.

926
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,680
Thank you Jeff

927
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:52,459
here we go.

928
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:57,839
OK.

929
00:31:58,819 --> 00:31:59,810
So that was incredible.

930
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,579
I love watching demos and I cannot wait for all of you to try it.

931
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,099
They're already launched today.

932
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,459
I saw them come in this morning,

933
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:07,079
so I'm,

934
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,780
I'm waiting for you all to try it

935
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:09,599
now

936
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,900
whether you are building agentic applications or traditional microservices,

937
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,880
how can AI help you operate smarter?

938
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,689
Here's the reality

939
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:22,290
our environments are only growing more and more complex

940
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:23,209
as a result,

941
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,550
you are managing more alerts,

942
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:25,989
more,

943
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:26,310
uh,

944
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,319
incidents than ever before.

945
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,650
How do you discern

946
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,660
which alerts are important,

947
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,510
urgent?

948
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,300
How do you.

949
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,410
Discern which incidents are like sub 2 sub-0,

950
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:37,170
and so on.

951
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,719
Troublesshooting is always

952
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,020
like finding a needle in the haystack.

953
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,680
We use this phrase every year,

954
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,180
but now this haystack is getting more and more bigger,

955
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,280
more and more complex every single day,

956
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:50,400
um,

957
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,880
so you need AI not just to help you observe better but also operate smarter.

958
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:02,000
When AI does the heavy lifting of correlation analysis root cause investigations,

959
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,300
it frees you up

960
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:06,939
so you can innovate on behalf of your customers.

961
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,599
So Cloud Watch Investigations launched earlier this year in GA.

962
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,640
It is a generative AI powered tool

963
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:18,869
that has a capability to automate root cause analysis

964
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,040
and gives you a hypothesis of what went wrong.

965
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,099
It also guides you through troubleshooting as well as remediation.

966
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,349
But what's more,

967
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,119
um,

968
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,770
I think like what would be better

969
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,369
than being reactive

970
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,150
and even if you solve the problem quickly,

971
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,069
it's not having the problem in the first place and being in a more proactive mode.

972
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,699
So you wanna go to a preventative mode

973
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,760
instead of always being reactive.

974
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,300
Now how do you do that?

975
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,140
So one of the things

976
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:52,869
that we have launched recently to help you with that

977
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,239
is interactive incident report generation in CloudWatch.

978
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:02,520
So I wanna explain why this is so critical in my conversations with many of you.

979
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,270
I hear all the time

980
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,589
how does A

981
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,329
AWS handle

982
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,688
post incident analysis

983
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,830
and how do you use that

984
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,168
to improve your own operational excellence internally?

985
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,659
How does AWS do it?

986
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:19,929
So we've had this process we call correction of error

987
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,989
and if you Google COE it shows you center of excellence,

988
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,649
but this is correction of error,

989
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,429
uh,

990
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,879
and we've been using this for over two decades.

991
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:29,219
So what we do,

992
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:32,590
we document everything that happens during an incident.

993
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:35,000
Identify root causes,

994
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:36,000
take actions.

995
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,409
How do we prevent reoccurrence?

996
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,780
All of this knowledge is then captured in a database.

997
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,059
And with just one click

998
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:45,268
you can now

999
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,579
excuse me,

1000
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:51,648
take the same information that we have done for two decades at AWS

1001
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:53,539
and now using Cloud Watch

1002
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,049
investigations report generation feature

1003
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:00,708
you can now generate your own incident summaries

1004
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,468
and we have also added

1005
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,989
AI powered

1006
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,618
Fivewise workflow.

1007
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,029
It's a process we use internally

1008
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:11,448
on answering the five whys behind every incident.

1009
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,689
And we have the same process

1010
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,909
out for you with this feature.

1011
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:22,989
Now this feature automatically gathers and correlates all of your telemetry,

1012
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,409
your deployment,

1013
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,090
and every text and action that you

1014
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,060
take during your own incidents and investigation,

1015
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,590
and it produces

1016
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,580
a detailed actionable incident report.

1017
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,870
Now here's why this is so powerful.

1018
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:38,750
This is not a generic template.

1019
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,610
This is tailored

1020
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,260
to your change history,

1021
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,260
your environment,

1022
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,729
and your architecture.

1023
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,469
It's customized for you

1024
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:48,570
so that you can create a similar,

1025
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:49,070
uh,

1026
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,050
knowledge base

1027
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,610
from which you can then

1028
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,489
have insights and have AI powered,

1029
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,100
uh,

1030
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,270
preventative actions that you can take.

1031
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,229
We also know that not all of your teams are in the AWS console.

1032
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,909
Developers usually are in their

1033
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,929
favorite IDs

1034
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:11,090
or in AI productivity tools like Hero,

1035
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:16,209
so we are bringing observability exactly to where the developers are,

1036
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,659
to their workflows.

1037
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,090
We're doing this with CloudWatch MCP servers.

1038
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:24,344
Developers stay in their preferred tool of choice.

1039
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:27,175
They connect their AI agents to CloudWatch,

1040
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:30,145
and they have access immediately to

1041
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,284
application performance

1042
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:32,814
and other health information

1043
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:34,885
so that you can troubleshoot

1044
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:35,705
issues,

1045
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:37,564
operational issues in particular,

1046
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:38,584
way faster.

1047
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:42,110
But what about other workflows like pull requests,

1048
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:43,149
code reviews,

1049
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:44,989
or deployment workflows?

1050
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,729
So we are introducing

1051
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:48,689
application observability

1052
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:51,330
for AWS GitHub action.

1053
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,909
This meets developers exactly where they are right in GitHub.

1054
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,439
Now you can bring your production telemetry

1055
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,479
to your code.

1056
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,580
You can diagnose your production issues.

1057
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,010
Use,
you can use live telemetry to,

1058
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,129
uh,
diagnose it.

1059
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:11,060
You can auto generate pull requests with the exact

1060
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,669
code changes that you will use in production,

1061
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,620
and you can instrument applications directly in GitHub repos.

1062
00:37:20,729 --> 00:37:21,229
So now

1063
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,879
that we've seen these two features,

1064
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:25,189
I'd like to bring Jeff back on stage

1065
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,610
to show us how it works.

1066
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,010
Watch out on the steps,

1067
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:28,629
Jeff.

1068
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:32,899
There you go.

1069
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,590
All right.

1070
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,639
All right,

1071
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:38,739
so,
um,

1072
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,860
the,
the beauty of modern operations is having some choice.

1073
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,620
Well,
you can actually maintain the speed of troubleshooting.

1074
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,149
And there's a lot of different ways you might be doing that.

1075
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,600
You might be troubleshooting natively in AWS,

1076
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,469
you might be building your custom agents,

1077
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,949
or you're working at GitHub,

1078
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:53,739
and

1079
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,510
If you take away one important thing from my talk today,

1080
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,610
we really want to meet you where you are and how you work.

1081
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:01,489
So

1082
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,489
cloudwatch investigations is going to complement what you're already doing.

1083
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,179
It's gonna leverage AI to answer questions that you might say,

1084
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:09,669
why did this alarm fire?

1085
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,760
And it's gonna hopefully do it for you faster than manually connecting the dots.

1086
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:14,860
So what do you do,

1087
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,810
you actually configure an alarm to automatically trigger this investigation.

1088
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:20,620
At no additional cost,

1089
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,379
so every alert

1090
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,840
turns into an instant AI powered analysis.

1091
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,560
By the time you actually get that alert,

1092
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,469
you log on,

1093
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,919
the investigation is ready,

1094
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,479
ready there for you to review,

1095
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,580
so you get to the root cause in minutes instead of hours.

1096
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,979
So here's what happens when an investigation gets triggered.

1097
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:43,209
The AI builds an internal topology of your services and your resources,

1098
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,850
and then it analyses and correlates the metrics,

1099
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:46,570
the logs,

1100
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:47,360
the traces,

1101
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,169
and the deployments.

1102
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,649
All those things that you might have to go to several different places and look here,

1103
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,550
there and,

1104
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,270
and elsewhere to get all the right information.

1105
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,889
It pulls it all together,

1106
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:56,850
within seconds,

1107
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,570
it surfaces some hypotheses and even suggests

1108
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,570
some actions to accelerate your troubleshooting.

1109
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,959
And what you do next,

1110
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,770
you review these key insights,

1111
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,360
and that that they're going to show you

1112
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,840
the actual reasoning behind each of the hypotheses,

1113
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,260
and you get full transparency into how the AI actually arrived at the conclusions

1114
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:14,919
that it did.

1115
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,510
Alright,

1116
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,310
so

1117
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,080
from here,

1118
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:19,850
so

1119
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:20,649
inside Amazon,

1120
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:21,760
we,
we do this process,

1121
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:23,250
you heard we call the five whys.

1122
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:23,810
So we,

1123
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,129
we,

1124
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,129
we literally dive deep to make sure we fully understand

1125
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,580
the deepest of the root causes for any problem.

1126
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,590
So we've built that same thing into this feature.

1127
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,030
So automated incident report generation,

1128
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,979
building on our own processes that would have served

1129
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:40,689
us incredibly well for over two decades of uh

1130
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,330
of running AWS and all of Amazon actually.

1131
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,550
So this is not simply just like a generic template,

1132
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,649
it pulls from your telemetry,

1133
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,840
your deployment,

1134
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:51,550
and your health events,

1135
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:54,739
all the things that tell the actual real data-driven

1136
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:57,330
story of what happened in your actual environment.

1137
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:03,520
So the timeline events are automatically pulled from the logs and the metrics,

1138
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:06,669
speeding up the process of actually documenting the

1139
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,689
the investigation,

1140
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:11,850
so you can focus on the learnings and then improving your own team's operations.

1141
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,790
And these reports,

1142
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,100
they also include the,

1143
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:18,209
the root cause analysis that was generated using

1144
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:19,129
the,

1145
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,100
the answers to these five whys.

1146
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:21,649
And again,

1147
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,060
the same framework that we use inside of Amazon,

1148
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,739
we call it the COEs or the correction of errors,

1149
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,250
and

1150
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:29,550
these COEs actually become somewhat legendary.

1151
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:33,415
Over time because they're they're effectively the repository of all

1152
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:36,344
the ways things have gone wrong over years and decades,

1153
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:38,074
and we refer to these often,

1154
00:40:38,284 --> 00:40:41,125
and making sure that as we design and architect new systems,

1155
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,695
make sure that we fully understand all the lessons

1156
00:40:43,695 --> 00:40:46,655
learned from the from the now historic COEs.

1157
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,939
But we also extend these

1158
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,899
troubleshooting capabilities just beyond

1159
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,439
the AWS environments.

1160
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,439
We're,
we're here for developers,

1161
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,500
for SREs

1162
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,229
and DevOps engineers,

1163
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:01,699
making sure that we meet you where and how you like to work.

1164
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,689
So we see that teams are building custom agents using their own

1165
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,110
LLMs on popular LLMs,

1166
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,639
and they're also using IDEs such as Kira.

1167
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:12,120
So let's,

1168
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,179
let's kind of take the,

1169
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,590
the,

1170
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,149
the role.

1171
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,699
We're,

1172
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:15,870
we're an on-call SRE

1173
00:41:16,229 --> 00:41:17,469
and we need to fix some code,

1174
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:20,290
but we're not an operations expert on this particular application.

1175
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,459
The,

1176
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:26,139
the CloudWatch MCP server connects the AI models directly

1177
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,360
to all of the tools inside of CloudWatch.

1178
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,729
And so the SRE can actually

1179
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,530
ask questions in natural language,

1180
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:34,179
but

1181
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:36,870
I,
I think there's actually a pretty cool and amazing breakthrough.

1182
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:38,469
So you don't have any,

1183
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,179
you don't need any specialized operations knowledge.

1184
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:42,870
So I go ahead and I ask Kira,

1185
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:43,510
and I,

1186
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,129
I literally just ask a question.

1187
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,250
Can you investigate why payments are taking too long in the billing service?

1188
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,179
So Kira does a couple of things.

1189
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,489
It analyzes the alarms that are firing,

1190
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,389
it gets the,

1191
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,860
the business SLOs,

1192
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,830
it takes a look at some historical patterns.

1193
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,250
Then it investigates the log anomalies and

1194
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,590
it correlates the metrics with the deployments.

1195
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,429
And then it points to the exact method call,

1196
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,860
the one that actually caused the SLI breach,

1197
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,879
and then it goes to the next step.

1198
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,520
I think this is actually super,

1199
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,379
super amazing.

1200
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,219
It suggests actual fixes and optimizations.

1201
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:19,360
Now all this happens through natural language interaction,

1202
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,520
so there's no dashboard navigation,

1203
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,949
there's no query languages,

1204
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,310
no switching between pages and tools.

1205
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,100
So

1206
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:28,899
everybody on your team is now empowered to troubleshoot

1207
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,689
like an operational expert.

1208
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,530
This year I've spoken to developers in,

1209
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,449
I just counted yesterday,

1210
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,090
14 different countries,

1211
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:39,479
and I actually

1212
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,889
have been able to get some really interesting senses of,

1213
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,360
of what some of the more,

1214
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:44,500
more um,

1215
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,560
Interesting challenges are.

1216
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,840
And one of the things that they tell me,

1217
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,159
and they tell me in a lot of different ways,

1218
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,820
is,
but they want to get the

1219
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,479
make sure that the operational metrics and the production telemetry,

1220
00:42:54,729 --> 00:42:56,989
they somehow want to get that side by side,

1221
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,790
the source code,

1222
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,979
so they can actually see

1223
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,020
in a very live sense

1224
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,179
how their code is affecting operational metrics.

1225
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:06,110
And so we're bringing this intelligence.

1226
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,100
Directly into GitHub,

1227
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,629
this AI powered intelligence.

1228
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:09,340
So

1229
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,419
we know that as developers,

1230
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,100
we often spend a good part of our day in,

1231
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:12,820
in GitHub.

1232
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:14,199
So the,

1233
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,969
the new AWS observability GitHub action,

1234
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,889
it plugs in seamlessly into,

1235
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,590
into your developer workflows.

1236
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:21,340
And it,

1237
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,300
as,
as I'll show you,

1238
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:24,659
it triggers analysis with CloudWatch and

1239
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:27,100
with the application Signals MCP servers.

1240
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:29,770
So here's how this works.

1241
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,750
So as a developer,

1242
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,850
I,
I can

1243
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,949
open up an issue.

1244
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,350
And all I have to do is I mention the,

1245
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:38,580
the AWSS APM GitHub user,

1246
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,610
and maybe I and again in natural language,

1247
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,100
help me investigate availability issues in my appointment service.

1248
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:46,179
So,

1249
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,840
the AI analyzes the,

1250
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,199
the live production telemetry,

1251
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,860
it's got access to the source code,

1252
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:51,459
and it

1253
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:54,760
jumps in and it identifies the actual root cause.

1254
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:55,760
So here it's,

1255
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:56,600
we,
we,

1256
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,100
we.

1257
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,020
It comes,

1258
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,179
it says remove this line from from the

1259
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,250
function function 3 different version lambda function.

1260
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,439
Go ahead to line

1261
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,580
27,

1262
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:06,899
and we actually,

1263
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,159
you can see there that it's actually raising an exception on a particular

1264
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,000
ID.

1265
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:13,080
So it gives you a very specific,

1266
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:14,679
very detailed fix.

1267
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:17,199
And from there,

1268
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,219
if you look at that fix and you say,

1269
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:19,790
OK,

1270
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,360
and

1271
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,750
here you have to make sure you,

1272
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,090
of course,

1273
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,679
as the developer understand that this is the right fix,

1274
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:27,120
you then ask the AI to implement the solution.

1275
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,030
So from there,

1276
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,080
it's going to automatically submit the pull request

1277
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,199
with precise fixes based on both the telemetry

1278
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,600
and the code analysis.

1279
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,830
So at this point,

1280
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:38,939
you're now in this intelligent developer partnership where

1281
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:42,659
observability lives directly inside of your native environment.

1282
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,169
Again,

1283
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:48,409
the modern operations that we're talking about today,

1284
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:51,860
we need to meet you as a developer and operator where you work.

1285
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:55,000
So we want to support you with your tool and tools of choice.

1286
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:57,689
We want to make troubleshooting fundamentally easier.

1287
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,540
So again,

1288
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,850
as we often like to say,

1289
00:45:00,169 --> 00:45:01,370
focus on what matters,

1290
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,929
building exceptional applications for your customers.

1291
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,020
Thanks again for watching.

1292
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,149
Thank you,

1293
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:11,649
Jeff.

1294
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:16,959
All right,

1295
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:18,979
so Jeff showed us how AI can help

1296
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:22,409
with troubleshooting and it accelerates troubleshooting for you,

1297
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,300
but

1298
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:26,739
let's think about an instance where you're overwhelmed with data.

1299
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:29,000
So AI helps you scale,

1300
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,379
but it also

1301
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,129
generates exponentially more data.

1302
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,419
This creates new operational challenges.

1303
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:40,360
While AI helps you solve some of the old ones,

1304
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,290
it's automatically also creating more challenges for all of us

1305
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,340
so think about it during a time sensitive event

1306
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:48,870
either let's say you're,

1307
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:49,489
uh,

1308
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:50,389
live streaming

1309
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:51,550
or

1310
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:56,409
you're in a product launch or for some of us getting ready on the run to reinvent.

1311
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:59,929
And you need to scale your capacity at near real time,

1312
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:02,040
but your data is fragmented

1313
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,800
and you don't have visibility

1314
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:08,300
into one single place where you can go and look at your entire estate.

1315
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:09,239
Now

1316
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,239
that's exactly why we are focused on simplifying operations

1317
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,370
in the cloud.

1318
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,419
It's not all just about gentic.

1319
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,360
You need to continue to improve

1320
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:19,500
how you operate,

1321
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,300
how do you manage your infrastructure,

1322
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:22,060
and so on.

1323
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,090
So first we wanna give you

1324
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,489
faster and easier insights and this begins

1325
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,050
with log analytics.

1326
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,429
We are enhancing pipe processing language or PPL

1327
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,169
to make log analytics

1328
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,090
faster and more accessible

1329
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:39,794
throughout.

1330
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:41,655
Amazon Open Search Service

1331
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:44,334
now with NLP support

1332
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:47,504
and more than 35 analytical commands,

1333
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:50,854
you can pull insights from any log format

1334
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:53,054
using simple intelligent

1335
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:53,735
filter,

1336
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:54,395
extract,

1337
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:55,294
and parse.

1338
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:58,270
For example,

1339
00:46:58,489 --> 00:46:59,840
with just one query,

1340
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,080
you can parse your cloud cloud trail logs,

1341
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,320
filter by specific APIs.

1342
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,520
You can correlate that with VPC flow logs.

1343
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,909
You don't need any custom parser

1344
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,459
or regex patterns,

1345
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,770
and you can also start.

1346
00:47:13,985 --> 00:47:15,725
Analyzing immediately

1347
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:20,965
even if you're not familiar with PPL syntax by simply asking it in natural language,

1348
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:25,165
show me the number of lambda errors over the past one hour

1349
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:30,084
and open search will do the work for you to get the right query and the right insights.

1350
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:34,780
Next we have also expanded CloudWatch real user monitoring

1351
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:37,820
to both iOS as well as Android

1352
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,000
so that we can help troubleshoot

1353
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,820
mobile end user applications for you.

1354
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,060
So now

1355
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,520
you can understand

1356
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,399
screen loads you.

1357
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,889
You can see crashes

1358
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:50,949
any API latency

1359
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:52,750
and most importantly

1360
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:56,629
you can see how it impacts your end users while they're viewing

1361
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:59,389
whatever it is on their uh mobile phones

1362
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,090
so now you have visibility into both

1363
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,989
web applications as well as mobile applications.

1364
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:05,199
Next,

1365
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,260
you can also correlate user behavior with logs and traces

1366
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,709
in cloud watch application signals which we launched last year

1367
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:15,219
in order to give you end to end visibility.

1368
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:19,389
So with mobile support you can also narrow down the root cause

1369
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,310
to a particular set of cohorts of users.

1370
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,989
You can do this by particular device type

1371
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:27,479
of operating system versions

1372
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:29,110
or even by location.

1373
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,260
But insights alone are not enough.

1374
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:34,149
For example,

1375
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,939
during a security event

1376
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,620
you are correlating

1377
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:40,159
cloud trail API calls.

1378
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,620
You're doing this with VPC flow logs,

1379
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:44,399
IAM policy changes

1380
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,310
with resource configurations,

1381
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:51,830
and you're doing this across dozens of EWS accounts and possibly across regions.

1382
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,969
This is no longer just a log analytics problem.

1383
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,659
It is a security investigation problem.

1384
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:58,969
This is why

1385
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,449
we have simplified

1386
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:02,330
security monitoring

1387
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:05,219
by launching cloud trail aggregated events.

1388
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,229
For example,

1389
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:08,250
let's say an S3 bucket

1390
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,139
gets 10,000 get object requests,

1391
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,790
and it does this in 5 minutes.

1392
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:13,429
Let's say

1393
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,770
you need to understand whether this is just normal behavior

1394
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,909
or is this data exfiltration.

1395
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,429
Now with the aggregated events,

1396
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,790
you don't need to no longer scroll through thousands of JSON events.

1397
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,120
Aggregated events lets you easily spot

1398
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,320
the pattern

1399
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,419
and answer critical security questions

1400
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,080
so you know right away

1401
00:49:36,459 --> 00:49:37,899
you don't have to like you don't have to write

1402
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:41,090
custom queries you don't need to spin up lambda functions

1403
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:43,780
in order to parse the high volume of logs.

1404
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,959
It will tell you

1405
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:49,340
that 10,000 get object calls were made to your S3 bucket.

1406
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,320
And it did so with an error rate of 2%,

1407
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:52,969
let's say,

1408
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,469
and more importantly,

1409
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,239
it had a spike of 400%,

1410
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:57,979
uh,

1411
00:49:57,979 --> 00:49:59,530
during this access.

1412
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,959
So in seconds you now know

1413
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,360
who accessed your pipelines and you know which of the resources were

1414
00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:07,479
accessed.

1415
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,139
So Cloud Trail now does the heavy lifting for

1416
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:12,320
you so you don't have to create all of that

1417
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:14,800
pre uh by pre-aggregating for you.

1418
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:16,540
Next,

1419
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,010
So a lot of your data

1420
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:20,469
lives in silos.

1421
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,250
For example,

1422
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:23,830
you might have application data in one account,

1423
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,429
mobile data in another,

1424
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:27,590
database metrics in yet another.

1425
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,020
So when you're investigating an incident,

1426
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:32,050
you need to connect the dots for

1427
00:50:32,189 --> 00:50:33,239
all of these things.

1428
00:50:33,379 --> 00:50:35,939
This is where centralized observability really,

1429
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:37,030
really matters.

1430
00:50:37,669 --> 00:50:38,169
So

1431
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,610
let's say you have logs that are across development,

1432
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,360
QA,

1433
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:44,310
production,

1434
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:46,250
and even across business units.

1435
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,320
Now

1436
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:52,080
it can be a challenge for you to monitor all of this across accounts and regions,

1437
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,370
so many of you have come up with your own DIY solutions to handle this

1438
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,040
with ETL pipelines

1439
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:01,239
to help remove this heavy lifting for you.

1440
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,790
We have launched cross account cross region.

1441
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,949
And log centralization and cloud watch,

1442
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:09,379
you can now consolidate log data

1443
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,020
from all of those things I was telling you,

1444
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,280
whether it's QA QA proud Dev,

1445
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,139
etc.

1446
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,219
across all of your AWS accounts and regions

1447
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:21,040
into one single destination account.

1448
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,780
And we're also expanding this cross-count cross region capability

1449
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,820
to support database insights

1450
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,790
with these enhancements now DevOps engineers,

1451
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,679
DBAs

1452
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:38,060
can monitor and troubleshoot across both RDS as well as Aurora databases.

1453
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:38,939
And

1454
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,620
now many of you are operating at global scale,

1455
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,959
serving millions of viewers,

1456
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,149
let's say across multiple regions.

1457
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:51,320
Centralized observability is super critical like we said earlier.

1458
00:51:51,669 --> 00:51:53,260
And that's exactly

1459
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,760
what is the situation at Warner Brothers Discovery.

1460
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,679
They do this every single day,

1461
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,979
running a massive ad platform

1462
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,820
across

1463
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:06,139
both HBO Max as well as Discovery Plus and other properties.

1464
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:12,389
And to show us how they use AWS to simplify their operations

1465
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,629
and drive performance

1466
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:17,560
in real time for their personalization of ads,

1467
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:18,830
please welcome

1468
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,239
Anand Narajan,

1469
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:23,929
VP of engineering from Warner Brothers Discovery to the stage.

1470
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,610
Welcome,

1471
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,110
Anan.

1472
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,750
Thank you,
Nanhani.

1473
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,270
Uh,
good morning,

1474
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,139
everyone.
My name is,

1475
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:38,209
uh,
Anand Narajan.

1476
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:40,699
I'm an engineer at Warner Brothers Discovery.

1477
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,070
If you're like me,

1478
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,139
you probably turned on CNN today and checked up on the news,

1479
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,100
or maybe

1480
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,919
you caught a rerun of The Big Bang Theory yesterday,

1481
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:51,040
or maybe Friends,

1482
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,070
admit it,

1483
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,120
Friends again.

1484
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,409
Uh,

1485
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:55,040
maybe over the,

1486
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,370
uh,

1487
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:59,489
Thanksgiving weekend you binge watched on White Lotus or

1488
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,870
you caught up with Harry Potter with the kids.

1489
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,520
If you did any of that,

1490
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:05,889
or if you're going to catch the Wizard of Oz or the sphere,

1491
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:06,889
if you did any of that,

1492
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:08,090
if you're going to do any of that,

1493
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:09,790
you're watching content

1494
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,899
from my company.

1495
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:12,830
We are Warner Brothers Discovery.

1496
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,429
We are one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the world.

1497
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:18,010
And we work

1498
00:53:18,389 --> 00:53:19,510
with AWS

1499
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,560
because they

1500
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:21,590
are a global partner.

1501
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,949
They too have a vast global footprint just like us.

1502
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:27,500
I lead AgTech

1503
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,459
at WBD

1504
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,429
and today,

1505
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,239
I want to talk about some of the exciting things that we are doing

1506
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,429
with AWS.

1507
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,770
We delight about 128 million+ customers

1508
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,899
in 100+ countries.

1509
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,060
Uh,

1510
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,979
on our flagship streaming services like HBO Max and Discovery Plus,

1511
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,979
you can watch the Tour de France or you can watch the Olympics in Europe,

1512
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,179
or you can watch cricket

1513
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,030
in the UK

1514
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,030
or the NHL in the US.

1515
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,080
You can also watch premium scripted content

1516
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:58,860
like,

1517
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,370
uh,

1518
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,760
Game of Thrones or the Superman movie.

1519
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,040
Have you guys watched the Superman movie?

1520
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:04,979
If you haven't,

1521
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,439
I'm not going to spoil it for you.

1522
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,939
You'll have to find out

1523
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:14,389
whether uh Lois Lynn picks Superman or Cluck and this time you'll have to find out

1524
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,389
whether

1525
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:18,489
Superman gets defeated by Lex Luthor or an AI.

1526
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,689
I can't talk to you about any of that,

1527
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,669
or what I can talk to you about

1528
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,149
is how we do streaming

1529
00:54:24,439 --> 00:54:25,570
on AWS.

1530
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,090
You see,
we take some content,

1531
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,530
like the Superman movie,

1532
00:54:29,949 --> 00:54:31,250
and we break it into

1533
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,370
thousands of little segments.

1534
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:36,510
Each of these segments is about 3 to 5 seconds long.

1535
00:54:37,229 --> 00:54:40,679
We construct a list of those segments that's called a manifest.

1536
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,260
When a user,

1537
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:42,739
uh,

1538
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:43,239
say Nandini,

1539
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:45,280
presses play

1540
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,560
on the Superman movie in the HBO Max app,

1541
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:50,979
we deliver that manifesto in real time,

1542
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,040
within a few seconds.

1543
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:54,469
The app on her device,

1544
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:56,020
parcels that manifest,

1545
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,500
pulls in those segments and plays them in sequence,

1546
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,209
and that

1547
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,169
in a nutshell

1548
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,489
is how streaming works.

1549
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,850
What happens if Nandini is an ad supported user?

1550
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:08,439
Well,

1551
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,909
AdTech is unique

1552
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:13,409
in the streaming world because ATech has two sets of customers.

1553
00:55:13,419 --> 00:55:13,919
One,

1554
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:14,850
the subscriber users,

1555
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:15,649
people like Nanhai.

1556
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,550
And the second is the advertiser.

1557
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:23,580
Advertisers care about these ads being effective,

1558
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:25,060
whereas users,

1559
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,020
they care about their viewing,

1560
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:27,639
uh,

1561
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:28,689
viewing experience,

1562
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:31,010
not being overly disrupted by ads.

1563
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,780
What that means is that these ads are personalized.

1564
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,919
If Nanhai or Jeff or David

1565
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,620
watches a Superman movie,

1566
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,199
they're going to see different ads

1567
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:42,979
this time around when Nanhai presses play.

1568
00:55:43,879 --> 00:55:47,120
We will fetch those ads for her in real time,

1569
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,179
splice those into the manifest,

1570
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,080
and then deliver to her again within a few seconds.

1571
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,510
Delivering the right ad to the right user at the right,

1572
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,449
on the right content at the right time is the heart

1573
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,449
of what

1574
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,469
AdTech does.

1575
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:03,199
This is how we do it.

1576
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:05,169
When the user hits play,

1577
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:08,250
her request will wend its way through our back ends,

1578
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,000
which includes my ad tech stack,

1579
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:13,820
and all these back ends are built on top of a bunch of AWS services.

1580
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,320
That request will wend its way eventually

1581
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,439
to a third party ad decisioning server on the far right there.

1582
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,510
This ad decisioning server is the one that actually picks those ads,

1583
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,679
and it's going to log its decisions,

1584
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,389
billions of decisions in,

1585
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,350
in a,

1586
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:28,969
in a month.

1587
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,030
Those decisions,

1588
00:56:31,149 --> 00:56:35,060
those logs will then wend their way back to us as a feedback loop.

1589
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,669
That's the pink arrow labeled one there.

1590
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:42,169
Now that feedback loop takes on the order of hours,

1591
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,020
which is way too slow for us.

1592
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:45,899
So we worked with Amazon.

1593
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,699
We built our own feedback loop.

1594
00:56:47,899 --> 00:56:48,659
This time around,

1595
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:52,489
we take the same signals that fire when Nanhai sees the ad,

1596
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,939
and we fed that

1597
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,639
into Amazon

1598
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,669
Kinesis,

1599
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,159
Flink and OpenSearch,

1600
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,090
and constructed our own feedback loop.

1601
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:02,780
That's the blue arrow marked 2 there.

1602
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,610
This feedback loop takes on the order of a few minutes.

1603
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:08,179
To see why this is important,

1604
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,760
let me show you an example.

1605
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,379
This is one of our open search dashboards.

1606
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:13,739
This is our eyes on Glass.

1607
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,020
This is what we look at

1608
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,820
when we want to check whether we're delivering ads correctly.

1609
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,800
Let me just drill down into one of those charts there.

1610
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:23,090
What this chart is showing you

1611
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,780
is how we're delivering those ads.

1612
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,719
Those green bars represent proper ad delivery,

1613
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:28,889
as you can see,

1614
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,750
as the event progresses,

1615
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,189
as more and more viewers watch this content,

1616
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,860
we will deliver more and more ads,

1617
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,179
and as the event ends,

1618
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,320
ad delivery drops,

1619
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:38,310
which is expected.

1620
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:43,350
The red and blue tips at the top of these green bars,

1621
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:44,709
those represent problems.

1622
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:47,429
Those represent cases where we are either misdelivering

1623
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:49,729
ads or not delivering ads at all.

1624
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:50,929
Either way,

1625
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:54,100
that's a problem for us because if we don't deliver ads or we deliver the wrong ads,

1626
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:55,870
it's lost revenue for us.

1627
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:59,129
You can see now why that feedback loop matters.

1628
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:02,340
If it takes on the order of hours for that feedback to come back to us,

1629
00:58:02,419 --> 00:58:06,520
the event or program may have ended by the time we even know that there's a problem.

1630
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:09,729
A feedback loop on the order of a few minutes

1631
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,330
is crucial for us to be able to course correct,

1632
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:13,330
um,

1633
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,149
and,
and,

1634
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:15,209
and collect revenue.

1635
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:17,830
All of this is,

1636
00:58:18,149 --> 00:58:18,590
uh,

1637
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,330
holds doubly true for live events.

1638
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:22,780
With live events,

1639
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,189
there's all the challenge of showing personalized ads that I talked about earlier,

1640
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,070
but in in addition,

1641
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:32,169
with live events we are building that content manifest

1642
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:33,949
as the event is progressing,

1643
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:35,790
as users are watching it.

1644
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,810
And often

1645
00:58:37,919 --> 00:58:42,050
we don't even know well ahead of time when the next ad break will appear.

1646
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,870
Delivering personalized ads in live events is

1647
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,600
one of the hardest problems in streaming.

1648
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,760
And as if this is not enough,

1649
00:58:51,149 --> 00:58:54,419
when you have 100,000 viewers watching this event,

1650
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:58,449
they're all going to hit the ad break at the exact same time.

1651
00:58:59,070 --> 00:58:59,570
Recall,

1652
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,989
we're showing personal ads,

1653
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,810
different ads to different viewers.

1654
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:05,739
So this means that we end up having to do hundreds

1655
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:09,739
of thousands of these decisions at the exact same time.

1656
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,729
That imposes a huge burden on our back ends,

1657
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,070
and they have to be scaled

1658
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,610
to absorb that kind of load.

1659
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,610
If we don't scale or if we underscale our infrastructure,

1660
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,540
We want your ads and we want to collect revenue.

1661
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,459
And if you overscale,

1662
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,219
we'll incur a huge cost.

1663
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:32,850
Our first attempt at dealing with this situation was to

1664
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,270
auto-scale based on traditional metrics like CPU and memory.

1665
00:59:36,929 --> 00:59:38,199
But those are not quite as

1666
00:59:38,459 --> 00:59:39,389
good for us.

1667
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,459
In this chart,

1668
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,540
what you see is the,

1669
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:44,719
the green line represents our traffic increasing and dropping.

1670
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,820
And the yellow line

1671
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,629
is our infra-scaling,

1672
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:49,939
struggling to keep up.

1673
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,870
So we worked with Amazon on an alternative approach.

1674
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,330
In our alternative approach,

1675
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:59,139
we developed a custom metric we call that permits,

1676
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:02,169
and permits bake in much more of those business factors.

1677
01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:04,169
They take into account content duration,

1678
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,169
DVR window,

1679
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,310
number of ads.

1680
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,020
We took those permits and we fed it to Amazon,

1681
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:09,600
Prometheus,

1682
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,090
and Kira,

1683
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,709
and we auto scale based on that.

1684
01:00:12,169 --> 01:00:12,790
Additionally,

1685
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,439
my teams build a predictive approach whereby we look at the

1686
01:00:16,439 --> 01:00:19,669
rate of change of permits over the past few minutes.

1687
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,010
And use that to predict the rate of change from us for the next few minutes.

1688
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:26,290
Now you can see our outcomes are much better.

1689
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:28,580
The yellow line

1690
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:30,780
stays above the green line.

1691
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,070
Our infrastructure is scaling.

1692
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:36,590
We are confident that our infrastructure is going to scale as the traffic changes.

1693
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,639
There's still work to be done here.

1694
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,280
Ideally,

1695
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,479
what we want is that

1696
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,879
that yellow line

1697
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,600
should closely hug the green line without ever going under.

1698
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:48,239
So there's a little bit more work for us to do here.

1699
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,399
But all in all,

1700
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,149
I'm very proud of what we have done here.

1701
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,300
We now have a 90% fill rate,

1702
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,530
which means that when there's an opportunity to show you an ad,

1703
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,979
90% of the time we will show you an ad.

1704
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,330
And we do this at very low latency.

1705
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,080
Trust me,

1706
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,969
if there's one thing streaming users hate,

1707
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,570
it's when you interrupt their content

1708
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,209
with ads

1709
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,389
that buffer.

1710
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:12,870
So we are now able to meet the

1711
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,149
requirements of high concurrency events

1712
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,830
with personalized ads

1713
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,389
at low latency

1714
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,629
with barely a dent in our uptime.

1715
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:24,469
And our costs are going down and in utilization is going up.

1716
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,530
This is great news for us.

1717
01:01:26,919 --> 01:01:30,070
Our successes depend a lot on our partnership with Amazon.

1718
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,909
We've used several Amazon services Prometheus,

1719
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,580
OpenSearch,

1720
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,250
Link.

1721
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,360
Uh,

1722
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,979
and I'm very excited to see

1723
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,600
where we go,

1724
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:39,830
where we take this further with our infra scaling,

1725
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,520
where we take this further with traceability with open search,

1726
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:43,239
and in general,

1727
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:43,679
I'm,

1728
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,300
I'm excited about our partnership with Amazon.

1729
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,260
Thank you.

1730
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,820
All right,

1731
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,850
can't believe where did the time go?

1732
01:01:57,919 --> 01:02:00,449
I wanted to do a long winded wrap up and everything,

1733
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,800
but my clock's telling me we're already at time,

1734
01:02:03,149 --> 01:02:04,580
so I'm gonna rush through this.

1735
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:05,310
So

1736
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,850
our commitment to you is we are improving

1737
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,320
our cloud operations support for all of you,

1738
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:12,989
especially along your agentic journey

1739
01:02:13,169 --> 01:02:13,820
for sure,

1740
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,750
all the while we're supporting hybrid and multi-cloud environments for you.

1741
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,649
Now we have a lot more coming,

1742
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:23,169
so watch this spaces and don't wait till reinvent next year.

1743
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,550
Watch for us doing more

1744
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:26,969
regular launches,

1745
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,560
uh,

1746
01:02:27,689 --> 01:02:29,330
especially in this age of AI.

1747
01:02:29,689 --> 01:02:32,360
So let's quickly recap everything we covered today.

1748
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:33,310
We showed you

1749
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,270
CloudWatch generative AI

1750
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:36,669
application map.

1751
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:41,929
We also Jeff showed you how to operate and use MCP servers and CloudWatch,

1752
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,629
GitHub actions,

1753
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:44,719
um.

1754
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,459
And then finally

1755
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,000
we showed you how to simplify operations and you

1756
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,229
saw Anan show you some of the features in

1757
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,679
uh open search as well as mobile RM.

1758
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,659
Please try that for your end users

1759
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:57,360
um and then

1760
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,209
I wanna

1761
01:02:58,719 --> 01:02:59,340
especially

1762
01:02:59,479 --> 01:03:00,909
thank David Proven

1763
01:03:01,229 --> 01:03:04,439
and from PGA Tour and Anandan Rajan from,

1764
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:04,879

Bar

1767
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:10,584
for joining me here on stage showing us

1768
01:03:10,764 --> 01:03:12,054
innovation can take many,

1769
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,125
many forms,

1770
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:14,364
and we are here

1771
01:03:14,564 --> 01:03:17,895
to support you whether you are running and testing agentic AI

1772
01:03:18,524 --> 01:03:21,675
or running battle tested mission critical applications.

1773
01:03:21,685 --> 01:03:23,284
We are here to support your journey.

1774
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:25,050
Take a look at this.

1775
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:26,669
Take a picture of this QR code.

1776
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,330
There's some,

1777
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:28,570
uh,
talks here,

1778
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,070
but there's a lot more to see.

1779
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,750
There's so much opportunity here.

1780
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:33,590
I wanna give you one sneak peek.

1781
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:37,330
Please attend Matt Garman's keynote tomorrow where he has

1782
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,989
several other launches from my teams on,

1783
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,149
uh,
cloud operations in particular.

1784
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,110
I guarantee you you're gonna love it among all the other,

1785
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,770
um.

1786
01:03:46,229 --> 01:03:47,909
Announcements that he has.

1787
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:48,830
So

1788
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,459
with that,

1789
01:03:49,469 --> 01:03:51,580
I hope to run into many of you during like

1790
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:53,219
the Chuck talks,

1791
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:53,830
breakouts,

1792
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:54,510
etc.

1793
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,860
Most importantly,

1794
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:57,969
connect with the brilliant minds here.

1795
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,169
It's a rare opportunity that we all get together.

1796
01:04:01,399 --> 01:04:02,929
And our partners,

1797
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:03,820
customers,

1798
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,530
the demo booths,

1799
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,949
check out the Quiro lab

1800
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,389
and most importantly have fun

1801
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:12,510
and I hope to run into some of you out there this week.

1802
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:16,330
Thanks again for spending the hour here both here as well as online.

1803
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:17,840
Bye.
