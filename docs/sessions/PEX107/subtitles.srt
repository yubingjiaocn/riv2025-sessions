1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,789
So today we're gonna be talking about fast

2
00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:05,030
track to growth, leveraging partner

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,469
programs and marketplace for success.

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:10,448
Um, you heard all week long that

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,470
AI agents can reason, they

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,989
can plan, they can execute with increasing

7
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:15,689
autonomy.

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,318
So they're not just processing requests, they're

9
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,888
anticipating our needs,

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,530
they're solving complex problems. They're

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,388
taking action

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,629
alongside us

13
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:26,888
and they're opening up more think time

14
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,888
and more create time for us so

15
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:31,449
that we can better exercise our expertise

16
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,509
and focus on relationships and innovation

17
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:36,668
and this is super, super important

18
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,329
in the sciences, for example, you know, the

19
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,408
really big breakthroughs that are happening because of

20
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,310
AI things that couldn't happen before.

21
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,060
MIT researchers, for example, use

22
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,179
machine learning to screen over 100

23
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,779
million chemical compounds

24
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,090
to lead to the discovery of a drug called

25
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:52,868
halacin.

26
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:56,139
And what it is, is it, it kills many antibiotic

27
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,560
resistant bacteria, which is super important.

28
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,098
But the most important thing is that

29
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:03,658
we would never have discovered it without ML.

30
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:06,099
It took actually literally 3 days to do it, but

31
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,129
in the old world would have taken years and years and

32
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,308
years. But you don't

33
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:12,308
need to be an MIT researcher to see how

34
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:14,629
the AI is transforming and interacting

35
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,918
with the world around us.

36
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:17,129
You see

37
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,668
I mean, you see it all around us, right? You

38
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,909
see now real-time translation in dozens

39
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,308
of languages at a new level of accuracy.

40
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,870
You see educators being able to use it

41
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,980
to really customize learning paths for,

42
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:29,980
for students,

43
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,790
um, and it's not just that it can do it, but

44
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,250
it can do it at scale

45
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,049
and in near real time,

46
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,290
and that is really what's amazing.

47
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,069
And I hope that all of you are incorporating it into

48
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,418
your lives as well. I know that I use

49
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:45,750
QuickSuite, for example, to help me prioritize

50
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,870
and answer some of my email and to prepare

51
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,790
for customer and partner meetings.

52
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,010
So AI is really rewriting the

53
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,480
rules of what's possible.

54
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,930
So now we can totally reimagine

55
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,040
processes, outputs, and outcomes built

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,168
with agents that can learn and reason and

57
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,719
achieve goals autonomously.

58
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,730
So in this session, we're gonna explore

59
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,808
some of the what ifs and how they

60
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:10,949
become what's next

61
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,270
as we chart our path through this.

62
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,308
So for those of you who don't know me, my name is Julia

63
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:18,050
Chen, and I lead a function called

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,118
Specialist and Partner Corps,

65
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:22,830
and what that is, is it's all of our

66
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,550
programs, incentives,

67
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,788
strategic collaboration agreements, enablement,

68
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,550
um, various, uh, strategic initiatives,

69
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:31,770
and I'm very pleased to be here,

70
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,365
um. With my colleague Matt Yanian, he's

71
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:36,844
sitting over there, vice president of AWS Marketplace

72
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:38,104
and Partner Services,

73
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:40,524
and we really have a front row seat into

74
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,683
something extraordinary, which is watching

75
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,683
all of you, our partner community,

76
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:47,264
use the power of AI to transform

77
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,724
customers and their outcomes and then also

78
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:50,925
your own businesses.

79
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,883
So in 12 months we've not just grown

80
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:56,163
the partner community, but we've really, you

81
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,485
guys have really transformed how we deliver

82
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,574
customer outcomes.

83
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,944
So let me share one example.

84
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:03,919
Trellix

85
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,479
is a global cybersecurity company and they had a

86
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,050
problem.

87
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,639
So security operations teams

88
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,679
were facing overwhelming volume

89
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,719
of daily alerts that required extensive

90
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,899
manual processing.

91
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:15,860
Um,

92
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,399
Trellix was actually able to transform

93
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,479
their cybersecurity operations by leveraging

94
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,879
Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova

95
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:23,699
to analyze

96
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,379
1000 daily security alerts

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,300
in just 30 seconds.

98
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:30,460
And it used to take them

99
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:31,979
80 hours,

100
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
so that's huge.

101
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,118
Not only did it reduce their time, but it also

102
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:38,199
reduced the investigation costs as

103
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,919
they're related.

104
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,169
So it's super inspiring to see what

105
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:43,990
we've been able to accomplish together

106
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,050
and we're just getting started.

107
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,949
So during the keynote that you heard from

108
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:51,088
Matt Garman, Swami, and Ruba about our

109
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,088
latest innovations that are gonna

110
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,909
help you fast track your growth,

111
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,409
and I hope you guys were as excited as I

112
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,449
was to hear about them.

113
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,000
Some things don't change though, so the technology

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,360
is changing fast, but our vision remains

115
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,319
unchanged,

116
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,719
and that is to make AWS the best

117
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,758
place to build market, sell, and

118
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,819
grow. Today Matt and I

119
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,159
are gonna be diving into the transformative era

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,259
that we're entering with Gen AI and

121
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,309
AI agents.

122
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,600
We're gonna share our perspective

123
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,600
on how you can better position your own businesses

124
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,059
to really thrive in the AI era

125
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:27,238
and how best to leverage our partner programs

126
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,819
and accelerate growth and differentiate

127
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:30,879
your offerings.

128
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,428
We'll also highlight the latest AWS

129
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,579
marketplace innovations designed to help you

130
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,619
deliver solutions faster and create

131
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:38,838
new revenue streams.

132
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:40,389
Are you ready?

133
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:42,428
Awesome.

134
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,798
It seems like every year, it's almost cliche

135
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,899
at this point. Every year we say the pace of

136
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,369
innovation is accelerating,

137
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,699
and I'm gonna say it again because it is,

138
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,329
and this year it's faster than ever.

139
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,988
According to Gartner,

140
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,988
Gen AI spending is gonna reach $644

141
00:04:58,988 --> 00:04:59,569
billion.

142
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,369
But it's just, it's not just that absolute

143
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,608
number that's incredible, it's actually the growth rate

144
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,850
76.4%

145
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,139
year on year growth is incredible.

146
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,329
Like we don't see those kind of growth rates on, you

147
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,129
know, sort of quote unquote traditional tech.

148
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,379
So, in 2025, we

149
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,420
AWS have released dozens of

150
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,088
major Gen AI services and future launches

151
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
across all different layers of the AWS

152
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,809
AI stack from our purpose-built

153
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:26,480
chips

154
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:28,939
to frontier models to

155
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,119
applications and also to developer tools.

156
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,088
Um, because we've said in the past 3 years

157
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:36,829
the partners who deliver business outcomes

158
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,488
now are accelerated with all of these different AI

159
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,829
tools and they will earn the highest margins.

160
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:45,559
Why do they earn the highest margins?

161
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,220
So some of you guys who've been to this talk

162
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,410
in years past recognize this slide.

163
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,899
This slide has actually not changed for

164
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,899
4 different reinvents. So it's been

165
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,059
the same slide, and every, and it's not

166
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,178
because every year I don't question whether the

167
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,369
the slide should change,

168
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,160
but actually because.

169
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,199
It's still valid, right? Like I've

170
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,579
not found a counter example to this.

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Delivering business outcomes is more

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,178
differentiated and unlocks more business

173
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:14,399
value than reselling AWS services

174
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,040
alone. Our commitment to accelerating

175
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,199
your journey, no matter where you are on

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,809
this path remains.

177
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,509
So we want to make our programs simple,

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,980
predictable, and profitable.

179
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,059
Some days we do better than others,

180
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,100
but we're always striving towards that

181
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:31,509
and today AI is increasing the

182
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,184
value of the business out. Outcomes

183
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,595
and so the margin difference now,

184
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:37,814
so the bottom is resell, right? Services,

185
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:40,064
managed services, tech solutions, business

186
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:40,665
outcomes.

187
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:43,264
The gap in profitability is actually getting

188
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:43,803
bigger

189
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:46,884
because the Gen AI and the agentic AI

190
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,983
is helping those business outcomes become even more

191
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:49,803
valuable.

192
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:52,444
We'll talk about some data around that as well.

193
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,259
So partners are seeing higher profitability

194
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,528
when they invest in 3 different areas.

195
00:06:57,858 --> 00:07:00,019
So the first is expanding your range

196
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,488
of services to customers.

197
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,899
So there's lots of different services that you can

198
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,059
provide to customers and you do, right? It's

199
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,209
advisory services, it's integration

200
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,738
services, it's implementation, migration,

201
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:11,858
modernization,

202
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,358
management of their infrastructure,

203
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,399
um, and support, to name a few.

204
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,100
The second one is around AI adoption.

205
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,920
And you'd have to have been asleep the whole week

206
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,278
if you hadn't picked this one up, but it's super, super

207
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,319
important both for the customer solutions but

208
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,358
also for your own running of your own

209
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,338
internal business. This is super critical.

210
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,048
And the third one is by leveraging AWS

211
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:36,160
Marketplace to really scale your

212
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,178
transformational offerings.

213
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,670
So partners that take advantage of all three

214
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,100
of these things are gonna grow faster

215
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,600
and get higher profitability.

216
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:47,838
The math is super compelling.

217
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,838
Our highest performing partners

218
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,059
can now earn $7.13

219
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,019
in revenue for every $1 of AWS

220
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:56,899
customers spend.

221
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,139
So that's up from $6.40

222
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,199
in 2022 thanks a lot

223
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,920
to AI.

224
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,028
And this is what's really exciting. We know that 82%

225
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,259
of our partners are already delivering

226
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,548
AI solutions and 73%

227
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,778
of you guys are using AI to transform

228
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:15,769
your own business,

229
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,588
and there's many ways that partners can

230
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,709
deliver business with uh deliver

231
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,798
value with AI

232
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,629
and I wanna share a few with you.

233
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,500
You have the poorest communities living

234
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,080
next to the most endangered species

235
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,840
in the world.

236
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,269
And we expect them to

237
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,469
protect those species whilst receiving

238
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:40,570
no reward

239
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,529
whatsoever

240
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,090
for their stewardship. AWS

241
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,509
was incredibly helpful in starting

242
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,450
this revolutionary process

243
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,570
of representing

244
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,009
what the needs of a particular species might

245
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,029
be. Tehanu

246
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,259
is the bridge between

247
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,389
conservation and community

248
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:02,109
development.

249
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:04,989
Our mission is to impact

250
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,229
communities by providing them

251
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,668
with an extra source of income

252
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,908
while protecting endangered species.

253
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:14,979
Working with Ad Astra and

254
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,489
Anthropic provided an incredible

255
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,070
solution. When you tried to work out

256
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,389
what were the basic needs of those

257
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:24,469
animals, boil those down into

258
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,927
simple tasks that. be acted

259
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:30,355
upon by human agents.

260
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:32,855
We take a huge amount of scientific

261
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:35,177
papers and data and

262
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:37,366
we extract what are the actual needs

263
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,136
that the gorillas have.

264
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:42,116
The AI is able to really

265
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,655
look for all the niche information and find

266
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:46,855
very specific recommendations and

267
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,956
what possible actions could be taken

268
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,187
to increase their life outcomes.

269
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:54,057
Anthropic's great accuracy and performance

270
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:54,796
makes it easy

271
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:57,803
to Monitor the behavior and

272
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:58,543
deploy it.

273
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,143
We managed to build a payment platform.

274
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,484
It starts with the species.

275
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:06,124
The species gets a digital identity.

276
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,523
The animal has a piggy bank and it's

277
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,523
going to pay you a few coins

278
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,643
if you do something that it really

279
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,702
needs. One example would be

280
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:16,722
a ranger removing

281
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:18,763
a snare, taking a picture, and

282
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:21,263
then send it, and after validation,

283
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,563
the ranger will actually receive money

284
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:26,030
directly into their mobile money. Account

285
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,410
AI for good

286
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,830
means taking all the powerful tools that we have

287
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,171
now and using them to

288
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,791
help protect other species, extend

289
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,221
biodiversity, help preservation,

290
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,431
and also help people in

291
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,551
need. The work that Tejano

292
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,791
Anthropic Adestra and AWS did

293
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,870
combines all these things together. It's

294
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,889
an incredibly exciting future

295
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,190
to imagine that we have AI

296
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,889
partners to help us

297
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,910
better protect other species on the planet.

298
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:06,029
So I was personally very inspired by

299
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,109
that video. So after I watched that, and I hope you

300
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:09,849
guys are as well, um,

301
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,849
leveraging Adastra's AI expertise

302
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:15,330
and really the comprehensive cloud solutions

303
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,090
of AWS, Tehanu is really

304
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,710
pioneering AI for wildlife

305
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,629
preservation.

306
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,609
Um, Adastra had to create a solution from scratch

307
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,830
using Amazon Bedrock, Amazon S3,

308
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,989
and AWS Lambda to fine tune

309
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:28,739
this AI

310
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,908
for wildlife conservation.

311
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:33,379
They had extensive data on mountain

312
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,558
gorillas and they were correlating that

313
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,940
um to documents and papers that

314
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,538
had been, you know,

315
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,058
research papers that have been done

316
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,109
and all of that had to come together.

317
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,739
But what's very important is that in order

318
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,899
for all of that to be, you know, correlated

319
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,250
and available to the AI it all had to be

320
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
in one place in modern infrastructure, modern

321
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,580
databases, etc.

322
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,739
So, um, this cloud-based infrastructure

323
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,080
enabled them to process behavioral data

324
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,418
110 times faster than

325
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,450
human experts.

326
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,859
So what used to take 24 hours

327
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:06,099
actually got reduced down to 13

328
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:08,658
minutes with 93% accuracy.

329
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,259
So that, I mean, scales, it's amazing and

330
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,379
especially in these far remote places where you don't

331
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,500
have a lot of resource and you don't have a lot of

332
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,580
humans to do this work, the time

333
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,440
really matters.

334
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:20,950
So, importantly,

335
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,788
Tehanu's approach uses technology to create

336
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:26,489
this bridge, right, between wildlife conservation

337
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,750
and economic development. And I think I

338
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,889
love that because it's a win, win, win

339
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,229
situation. And then you also

340
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:35,469
see how migration and modernization

341
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,619
together are really important to unlock the

342
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,570
full value of the AI.

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
So our ambition because you know this is going

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,298
to migration and modernization

345
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:47,678
is around increasing the modernization

346
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:49,840
service attached to your migrations

347
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,879
because that's really how you unlock the value

348
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,719
of the AI.

349
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,440
It's also migrating specialized workloads

350
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,639
that disproportionately feed business

351
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,750
outcomes and I'll dive into some of those specialized

352
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,580
workloads in a minute.

353
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:03,418
Um, and to also drive a relentless

354
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:05,820
focus on the value realization of,

355
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,558
of the migrations that you've done.

356
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,668
So it wouldn't be a program talk if I didn't talk

357
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:12,389
about MAP.

358
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,349
OK, so as a recap, the migration

359
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:17,788
acceleration Program is one of our largest

360
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:19,609
programs, and it serves two purposes.

361
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,029
It's a structured methodology for taking

362
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,269
a customer through a migration, and

363
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,349
it's also a funding program that helps

364
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:28,349
our customers with the upfront migration

365
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,090
costs.

366
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,590
Last year we enhanced MAP to be even

367
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,349
more streamlined and partner friendly.

368
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:35,889
We streamlined the funding approvals and

369
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,210
we accelerated payments and we expanded

370
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,869
support for for new to cloud customers.

371
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,139
The results that we saw were really, really good actually.

372
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,729
Our customers have been reaching their first

373
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:49,389
migration milestone 41%

374
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:49,979
faster,

375
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,269
so that's, um, I mean it's

376
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,349
partly due to the program, but it's very much

377
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,509
due to you guys. So thank you very much for doing that

378
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,509
work. Hundreds of

379
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,989
partners have achieved the migration competency

380
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,269
designation so that you can access the MAP

381
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:05,779
program and if you haven't, please look into it,

382
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,190
um, and we will continue to add tools

383
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,460
into the migration toolkit

384
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,119
so that you can do it more seamlessly and, and

385
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,590
quicker. This

386
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,710
is one example. So with our experience based

387
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,779
accelerator, we train your teams

388
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,029
to help customers build the organizational readiness

389
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,408
that they need for successful migrations.

390
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,269
Another way that we help customers accelerate

391
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,500
migrations is through Countdown premium.

392
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,038
It provides customers with immediate

393
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,538
access to an engineer,

394
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,989
um, across a range of services,

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,359
whether it beerless, database, AI, SAP,

396
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,139
whatever you need.

397
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,038
So instead of the customer opening tickets

398
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,080
and you know someone dealing with one-off tickets,

399
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:46,158
the same engineer will stay with the, with

400
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:48,389
the customer and that way they have all the context

401
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,580
that they need and they're able to resolve things faster.

402
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,619
So not only do we want our customers

403
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,038
to migrate and modernize so they can leverage the benefits

404
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,750
of AI for their business problems,

405
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,558
but we also want to use it to speed up the migration

406
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:02,788
itself. So we

407
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,308
have worked with several third party ISPs

408
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,428
that have tooling River Meadow, Monty Cloud,

409
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,830
Concerto, Matilda Cloud, you see them on the slide.

410
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:12,178
There's also many others as well that didn't fit

411
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,070
onto the slide,

412
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,408
but they have tools actually that

413
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,908
are available to you that help speed up migrations

414
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,538
and in some cases AWS will help subsidize

415
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:23,070
your use actually of their tools.

416
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,029
We've also launched AWS Transform

417
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,428
and you heard a bit about that as well with a lot of really

418
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,590
cool new features, so definitely

419
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,950
check that out. It's a new agentic migration

420
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,570
and modernization service

421
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,109
for enterprises.

422
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,759
It combines three powerful AI

423
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,210
technologies LLMs, graph

424
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,548
neural networks, and automated reasoning

425
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,849
to make it much easier and faster to migrate

426
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:50,080
and modernize and transform critical

427
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,330
workloads at scale.

428
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:52,469
So, you know, taking

429
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,989
Cobalt code and then turning it into

430
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:55,788
um Java.

431
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,668
It really results in a lot of time savings.

432
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:02,200
So for example, TCS, a global IT

433
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,639
firm, used AWS Transform to modernize

434
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,298
their customers' entire state

435
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,038
of 3000 VMs and saw

436
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:10,200
amazing results.

437
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,739
So they got to 95% accuracy

438
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,440
and 45 to 60% productivity

439
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,178
gains.

440
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,690
And map in the Gen AI era really

441
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,690
includes now modernization with Gen AI and

442
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,879
agentic features for your existing

443
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,428
applications, data, and workloads.

444
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,609
So let's get to these mission critical workloads

445
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,950
that we believe need to be prioritized.

446
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:33,519
So, um,

447
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,489
Tehanu, for example, probably wasn't using enterprise

448
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:37,190
software,

449
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,668
but I know that many of your customers do.

450
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,389
And every customer starts from a different place, but

451
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,469
one thing is constant, which is that a lot of

452
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:47,038
these critical workloads Windows, SAP,

453
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,009
VMware

454
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,908
actually perform better on AWS.

455
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,619
They can run more efficiently, scale more easily.

456
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,070
One example that we have is that SAP

457
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,070
Rise actually runs faster on

458
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,928
AWS.

459
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,719
So it's um it actually

460
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,108
uh we get 58% fewer disruptions

461
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,400
and 30% faster performance

462
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,838
running on AWS doing analytics.

463
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,650
Another example is Microsoft workloads. So

464
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,219
since 2008, we've been helping customers

465
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,219
reduce their operating costs by

466
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,299
an average of 39% when

467
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,539
it runs on AWS versus running on-prem.

468
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,848
Also helping our customers modernize their .NET

469
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:27,108
applications to .NET Core and from SQL

470
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:29,650
Server to AWS databases actually offers

471
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,068
two key benefits. It saves your

472
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,670
customers some licensing costs,

473
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,348
but it also enables them to use other AWS services

474
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,430
later like Bedrock and all the future

475
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,759
innovation that keeps coming.

476
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,068
Let's talk for a minute about VMware.

477
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:46,568
So according to analysts, 80% of companies

478
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,880
have an upcoming VMware contract event,

479
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,170
a renewal event in the next 24 months,

480
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,750
and 74% of customers are evaluating

481
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,818
alternatives

482
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,449
to their VMware workloads.

483
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,108
Amazon Elastic VMware service,

484
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:01,568
um, can help customers unlock the benefits

485
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:03,189
of AWS at scale.

486
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,568
Um, so this is something that you definitely want to

487
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,809
look into because it'll give your customers greater

488
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,809
control and agility, um, if they're

489
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,630
looking for alternatives to VMware.

490
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,078
It's something that you wanna have a conversation uh

491
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,098
about early on

492
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,640
so don't just take it from me. We have,

493
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,989
um, partners and customers feeling the same way

494
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:22,019
and here's a quote

495
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,459
from um from Aeromexico.

496
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,189
Another area that's gotten a pretty big boost from

497
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,229
AI is around managed services. So

498
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,348
you'll see me get really, really excited about

499
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,410
managed services, and you guys remember from

500
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,509
the partner profitability framework slide that I

501
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:40,630
showed, managed services is, you know, higher

502
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,650
up on the stack.

503
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,348
Uh, the data is actually very compelling internal

504
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:46,049
and external data that we have.

505
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,660
By 2026, MSPs

506
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,789
will manage 65% of cloud

507
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:54,309
service provider spending, so that's $443

508
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:54,890
billion.

509
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,559
But what's interesting,

510
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,618
especially interesting, is actually why

511
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,108
our research shows that partners working

512
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,799
with validated AWS MSPs

513
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,160
deliver 3 times faster customer

514
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,739
growth

515
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:09,400
because they're trusted advisors. It makes a lot of sense

516
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,479
and a lot of you actually are managed service providers I

517
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:14,039
know and so you are the trusted advisor

518
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,959
of the customer. You.

519
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,184
Day in and day out in their environment

520
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,614
you can spot things that they need and

521
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:21,654
that gives you an opportunity to really help

522
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:23,035
them advance faster

523
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,535
so that's why we're doubling down on our

524
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,535
investment in MSP partners and

525
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,993
for the first time offering monetary incentives

526
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,354
for managed services

527
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:33,654
and we have a couple of programs launching throughout

528
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:34,834
2026.

529
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,449
We have the MSP Incentive for Customer Management

530
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,719
that focuses on partners managing ongoing

531
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,799
customer operations and retention on

532
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,660
AWS.

533
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,559
Later next year we'll be launching the MSP

534
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,650
Incentive for Strategic Services focused

535
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,108
on partners delivering customer adoption

536
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,469
of high value AWS capabilities

537
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:54,430
like Gen AI,

538
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,029
like security, and other things as well.

539
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:59,549
And then we have an MSP government

540
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,588
practice benefit for those of you who work a

541
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,650
lot in public sector that support

542
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,949
partners that are serving government and education

543
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:07,229
customers particularly.

544
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,799
So let's hear from Cap Gemini's

545
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
experience with our managed service program.

546
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,160
As one of the key cloud providers,

547
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:17,358
Cap Gemini provides end to

548
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,559
end services for cloud. The AWS managed

549
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,650
service program has helped Cap Gemini

550
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:23,630
business through the training,

551
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,239
through the technical support, through the

552
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,699
access to technical architects

553
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:30,414
that we get, the employees. On

554
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:32,515
the G Gemini side have been able to

555
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,614
work with the financial services clients better. It

556
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,614
has helped us be more competitive in the market.

557
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,015
It has helped provide better solutions

558
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,515
or more cost

559
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:43,275
effective solutions to clients

560
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:45,674
and has helped with the right pipeline

561
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:47,634
revenue as well as

562
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:50,055
great joint big deals and wins

563
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:51,594
through access to all the.

564
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:54,180
Expertise as well as the

565
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,459
funding support by collaborating with AWS

566
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:58,689
on the minor services program, we

567
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,640
have close to achieved

568
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:03,559
close to 15 to 20% cost savings

569
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,180
just because of the support in

570
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,459
terms of the right technical solutions, faster

571
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,739
time to market, as well as

572
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:12,818
through the support and funding, which

573
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,920
helps us provide better

574
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,459
customer service to our clients.

575
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,229
So as you just saw, Cap Gemini achieved

576
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,588
higher profitability and we're able to cut costs,

577
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,828
um, as they were trusted advisors to

578
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:30,799
their customers.

579
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,529
Um, so this is the MSP advantage,

580
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,930
you know, in action, and we're gonna more and more

581
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:37,059
reward that.

582
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:41,189
So let's go back again to AI.

583
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:43,459
82% of partners are delivering AI

584
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,709
solutions. I'd said that at the beginning and really

585
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,189
integrating them into their into your,

586
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,739
I should say, processes and delivery.

587
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:51,009
So, um,

588
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,390
we're seeing that that actually pays off quite

589
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,719
a lot. Um,

590
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,630
we're seeing the biggest profitability bump

591
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,750
actually, um, in this area of

592
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,459
all the partner categories surveyed,

593
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,868
and we want you all in the room to really benefit

594
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,368
from this as much as possible.

595
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,250
So AI is sort of sprinkled everywhere

596
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,328
throughout and so throughout this talk you're gonna be hearing

597
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,328
how, how it plays into, into every part

598
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,439
of it. So,

599
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,650
um, I urge all of our resellers

600
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,019
to continue building up your services and your services

601
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:20,390
will be enhanced by AI.

602
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,979
There's a couple of different changes to our channel

603
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:24,000
partner programs.

604
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,660
I don't have time to get into them in great detail,

605
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:28,858
but this you will find some of it in, in

606
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,900
Partner Central, and we will continue to keep rolling out

607
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,098
webinars and office hours and various

608
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,400
different things. But to go over them quickly,

609
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,199
we're streamlining our base benefits.

610
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:40,170
So, um,

611
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,180
let's see, this is, this is going to be

612
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:45,509
more simplification, predictability, and earnings

613
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,449
and reduced overhead for you guys.

614
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:48,568
Um,

615
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:51,259
the base benefit consolidates our previous base

616
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:53,269
benefit and the technical capability discount

617
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,269
that used to be two separate things we're putting them

618
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:57,549
together. We also have a new customer

619
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,549
incentive, and this is not so

620
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:01,809
new customer incentive is not necessarily a new thing.

621
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:04,229
We've had it in various different flavors, but we're actually combining

622
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,239
it to be one thing now so that

623
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,430
that will be more simplified.

624
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,939
There's a partner growth incentive. So again,

625
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,630
we've had many flavors of

626
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:14,130
account growth, different levels of growth like

627
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,689
you guys are familiar with PGD, POD, various

628
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:17,529
flavors of that.

629
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,209
We're also consolidating all that into a partner

630
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:22,449
growth incentive at the portfolio level

631
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:23,989
for your resell portfolio.

632
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,189
And over time it'll expand to revenue

633
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,269
under management, but for 2026 it'll be

634
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,390
just your resell portfolio here

635
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,088
for this one.

636
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,509
And then we also have deal registration that we're

637
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:36,549
introducing for the first time for

638
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,009
more control and transparency

639
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,289
along with higher incentives and enhanced billing capabilities.

640
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:45,049
We're also excited to launch the partner Greenfield

641
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,459
program to help our partners build their Greenfield business

642
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,779
practice by scaling up AWS

643
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,858
capabilities and focusing on new

644
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:54,469
customer engagement in three priority areas

645
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,259
so migration, modernization, Gen AI,

646
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,430
and security.

647
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,608
Um, this program is gonna give you more coal

648
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,729
support, enablement, and resources to help our

649
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:06,769
partners to build their practice and

650
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,910
clear milestones and shared metrics.

651
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,959
OK, so we'll hear from Copa Airlines because

652
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,068
I wanna talk a bit about our ISV incentives

653
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:18,949

666
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:41,289
Amazon. I

667
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,309
love that video

668
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,130
so I mean we're all about partnering

669
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,239
and by the way like it's um like we're

670
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,489
seeing a lot more multipart solutions

671
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:51,529
coming together and I definitely wanna encourage that as

672
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:52,588
well but like you see

673
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,170
uh Copa Airlines, they were very happy with the

674
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,449
solution that they got and had enormous time savings

675
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,068
from the solution that was put together.

676
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,759
So we want to continue to enable

677
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,949
you so it's not just about programs it's about

678
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,949
all the different things partner equips game

679
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:09,029
days, webinars, trainings, and you

680
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:11,029
have to keep telling us and giving us feedback on

681
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,650
what it is you need to make sure

682
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:15,068
that you're getting what you, um, what you need

683
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:17,108
to learn as well as, uh, what you need in terms of

684
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,430
funding. So we give innovation and sandbox

685
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,049
credits to partners so that they can try things and experiment

686
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,848
for free,

687
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:25,430
um, and we've recently held our first ever

688
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,750
AI agent global hackathon.

689
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,519
Um, Swami, uh, Swami

690
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,598
had talked about it as well, so, um, we

691
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,630
had over 9500 developers from

692
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,880
over 127 different

693
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,049
countries build over 600 projects

694
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,739
using Amazon AI tools like Bedrock,

695
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,439
SageMaker, and Kiiro.

696
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,439
Our first place winner, um, that

697
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,699
you've heard was Ajito Nelson, so I'll just

698
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,029
feature him one more time.

699
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,680
Um, and his project was an

700
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,529
AI agent called Ecolahaic

701
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,559
that tracks waste management in Timor-Leste

702
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,799
using Amazon Bedrock and Agent

703
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,910
Core. So again, this is another story that

704
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,338
I love which is that he's able to democratize

705
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,838
the AI and actually make it so that

706
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,098
every single person

707
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,479
that had the app could take a picture of

708
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,598
waste. And be able to um

709
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:14,949
the app would would allow anybody to actually

710
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:17,108
report uh report and get the severity

711
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:19,509
of the of the pollution problem which is amazing

712
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,630
because then authorities could come in prioritize

713
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,289
and clean it up

714
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,769
it's really really cool

715
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,269
so I hope that you guys and all of your teams are

716
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,289
using this and experimenting with it because

717
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:30,459
truly the sky's the limit on what you can do with

718
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:31,489
these great tools.

719
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,539
All right, so please do win. This is the QR code in

720
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:37,598
case you wanna see more of the different

721
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:39,660
um projects that there were. There were so

722
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,890
many amazing, really inspirational projects,

723
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,180
and so you should take a look in case you didn't get a

724
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,500
chance to look at the various, uh, the various

725
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,519
projects that were submitted.

726
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:51,039
These are really like when I talk about business outcomes,

727
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:53,130
right? It's really cool to see the business outcomes that

728
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,049
people come out with.

729
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:55,789
All right.

730
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,328
Speaking of business outcomes, the main program

731
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,479
supporting business outcomes right now is called Box.

732
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:02,809
It really empowers our partners to deliver

733
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,930
exceptional customer outcomes through

734
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,209
multi-product solutions and collaboration

735
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:08,108
opportunities.

736
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:10,608
So we've, uh, Box is not new,

737
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,088
and it's already helped over 350

738
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:14,949
new solutions come together.

739
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,430
And you know what, we were able to generate,

740
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,789
uh, and co-sell

741
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,209
50 quality opportunities that converted

742
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:22,299
to 20%.

743
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,733
So this is really. Really good impact and

744
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,094
so we're gonna continue expanding Box.

745
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:29,035
Um, it's gonna have

746
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:31,453
more enhanced account planning, marketing

747
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:33,834
support, funding for industry specific use cases.

748
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:35,545
It's gonna strengthen the co-sell,

749
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:38,354
um, with us and then also it'll, um,

750
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:41,064
it'll improve seller visibility visibility

751
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:43,493
so it'll be more visible to our, our internal

752
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:44,743
CRM users.

753
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:47,134
So these improvements are gonna help partners to

754
00:28:47,134 --> 00:28:49,354
better serve the line of business which I know

755
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,354
is a priority for, for all of us.

756
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,848
I will go through some of our other uh

757
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:57,890
ISV programs quickly. So we

758
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,949
have the workload migration program.

759
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,410
Um, so workload migration program, also

760
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,529
not a new program, has been around for some

761
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:07,039
time. But some of the new enhancements

762
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,279
to it are that you're gonna be able to now offer

763
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,279
credits to existing customers. This is, this

764
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,279
is new. Previously had not been there

765
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,739
before and simplified ARR calculations

766
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:16,380
and tooling.

767
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,699
So I hope that that will help all of you guys to help

768
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:20,140
migrate, um,

769
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,838
to migrate workloads from anywhere basically

770
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:24,019
onto AWS.

771
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,568
All right. And then our ISV accelerate

772
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,709
program, also not a new program, has been around

773
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,150
for, for quite some time.

774
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,549
Um, it's really the powerhouse behind

775
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:36,689
our cosell engine with ISVs.

776
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,410
So what makes it special is our AWS sales

777
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,930
teams get to retire quota and they get compensation

778
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,920
to co-sell with you.

779
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,410
Your solutions are also featured in our internal

780
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,479
recommendation engine and, um,

781
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,598
and it really, you know, many of you guys who

782
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,769
are in this program tell me it makes a big difference

783
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:53,789
to motivate our sellers to work with you.

784
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,459
So that um we will continue

785
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,799
to expand that actually.

786
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,269
Um,

787
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:02,029
we expanded this last year. It was marketplace

788
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:04,068
only, but we expanded it almost 10-fold

789
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,430
and allowed 10 times more ISPs

790
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:07,568
onto the program.

791
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,650
And then also, um,

792
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,410
uh, sorry, and I'll skip now to Marketplace

793
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,150
private offer promotion program.

794
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,799
So this actually we're gonna expand

795
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,858
by quite a lot.

796
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,318
Uh, we dramatically expanded it uh with

797
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,709
end to end automation that delivers credits

798
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,029
within one business day of offer acceptance,

799
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,348
which is fantastic. We know that speed matters when

800
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:29,858
you've got a deal on the table and so this automation

801
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,939
should help you win more deals.

802
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,229
We also have two additions to MPOP.

803
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,630
Now we have an MPOP Activate

804
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,029
to support new marketplace sellers, including

805
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,108
qualified global startup participants

806
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,430
that are in their first year or in their 1st

807
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,000
20 private offers.

808
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,949
We also have for all of the veterans MPOP

809
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:51,029
Grow, which, um, which

810
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,029
provides established partners with ongoing

811
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,630
support covering 20% of marketplace

812
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,029
contract value with an additional 0.5%

813
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:00,368
on select agentic AI products.

814
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:03,789
So looking ahead to Q1 2026

815
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:06,160
because we have an exciting roadmap coming up, we're

816
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,549
introducing product level eligibility

817
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,250
in our automated partner funding tool to help

818
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,809
ensure we're investing in solutions that are deployed

819
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,309
on AWS.

820
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,078
And we know that success in the cloud is

821
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,358
not one size fits all, and we always

822
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:24,259
wanna meet you where you are

823
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:26,680
and so please keep telling us where you are

824
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,750
in your journey and we've got the tools and if

825
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,130
we don't have them, we'll make them

826
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,799
um the tools to help you along your AWS

827
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,660
partner journey.

828
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:36,338
Um, but to truly scale this impact, we

829
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:39,019
need to transform how our customers discover,

830
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,420
buy, and consume technology,

831
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:43,818
and this is where AWS Marketplace comes in,

832
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:46,219
and I'd like to invite Matt up to the stage because he's

833
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:48,118
gonna tell you all the magic on Marketplace.

834
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:56,160
Nice. Hi.

835
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,430
Yeah, let me reiterate,

836
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,750
thank you for being here on the Thur I think

837
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,729
it's, is it Thursday?

838
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:05,118
Does everyone else have that eye twitch at this stage?

839
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:06,979
Yes, yeah, I'm, I'm with you.

840
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,279
Um, so I, I guess I'm one

841
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,930
of the last things that stands between, uh,

842
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,358
between you and the replay party. I hope to see you

843
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,479
on the dance floor last night. I saw a couple of you at

844
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:17,519
the mission, uh, party last night. I

845
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,630
did an Irish exit though, pretty, which I can say because

846
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,439
my wife is Irish,

847
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,039
um. So my name is Matt Yanian.

848
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:25,309
I lead AWS Marketplace and partner services,

849
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,920
and,

850
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,459
uh, it does sound a bit cliche, a bit like,

851
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,509
uh, you know what Julia was saying before,

852
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,759
but it, it's true. I am so excited

853
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,900
to be here this year. I, I've been at AWS for 13

854
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,009
years, but I've been in this role for about 3,

855
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:37,799
3.5,

856
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:40,118
and this is really the year when we delivered a

857
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:40,699
lot of things

858
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:43,699
that so many of you have been asking for for both marketplace

859
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,479
and partner center.

860
00:32:45,144 --> 00:32:47,483
And the other services that we launched. It's, uh,

861
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:49,164
it's been really validating for the team.

862
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:51,134
Uh, if you saw the partner Kino with Ruba,

863
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:53,473
I had the privilege of, of joining her for a few minutes

864
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,664
and doing a demo of some of the new features,

865
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,674
and it just felt good for my team, you know,

866
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:59,834
they, they put their blood, sweat, and tears in often

867
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,983
over Thanksgiving weekend to get these

868
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:02,733
features to you.

869
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:03,920
And uh

870
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,719
and now they're real and we're getting great feedback

871
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:09,239
and hopefully you're seeing that your feedback matters

872
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,400
and you're seeing that feedback

873
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,818
reflected in our roadmap whether it's in

874
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:14,969
Partner Central with the APIs and I'll talk

875
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:16,979
about it. I've been joking that Graviton 5

876
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:19,439
and Training 3 ain't got nothing on Partner Central 3.0,

877
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,818
um, but uh, you know, keep giving

878
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:23,939
that feedback because we're moving quickly. We've

879
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:26,140
shipped 27% more features year to date.

880
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:28,719
Uh, thanks to AI enhancements, uh,

881
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:31,118
we can do more, and we've been doing a lot of foundational

882
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:33,250
work that you don't see, so we can deliver more

883
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,449
things more quickly to you. So today I'm gonna talk

884
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,910
about some of those new things,

885
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,250
uh, on both the marketplace side and the partner

886
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,920
services side,

887
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:42,328
but really this is, if anything, the takeaway

888
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,430
should be a call to action.

889
00:33:43,828 --> 00:33:45,989
You know, I want you to use these features

890
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,189
but provide feedback on what we should do next.

891
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,578
So if you do nothing else,

892
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,989
just start thinking about how you're gonna pin

893
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,108
me after this session and tell me what

894
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:56,150
you really need to take your growth to the next

895
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,598
level. Our

896
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:00,088
vision remains the same.

897
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,439
Uh, it's just an expanded vision now. We want

898
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:04,549
to meet customers where they are

899
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:05,699
and really have everywhere

900
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,260
or marketplace everywhere that customers are.

901
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,668
Uh, you saw us start to do this with things like buy with

902
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,789
AWS last year and we're now up to, I think,

903
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,349
18 different AWS service console integrations,

904
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,139
uh, but we're really just getting started.

905
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,619
And meeting customers everywhere isn't just

906
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,699
in an AWBS service console or a third

907
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,820
party catalog. It's also reducing

908
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,898
procurement friction and meeting them in the tools

909
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,019
that they use every day, whether it's sales

910
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:30,239
tooling or an ERP or a CRM or

911
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,659
any type of procurement tool. It means

912
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,659
putting marketplace in the right places for

913
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,780
the right personas that need to discover

914
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,860
and procure through the marketplace and making it easy to

915
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,039
use. So that's sort of a theme and a thread

916
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,539
that runs through everything we're doing.

917
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,867
We really took an intentional step even

918
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,318
organizationally actually to to reorganize

919
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:51,548
both the features and our own team around the buyer

920
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,528
journey this year

921
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,478
so you, you see the features and the program enhancements

922
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,677
and so much else we've been doing map that that

923
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:00,228
separation from discovery helping customers

924
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,398
find what you want and we'll talk about AI search and

925
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,697
agent mode and other things that we've rolled out there

926
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,697
through to

927
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:07,168
trying before you buy.

928
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,889
If you're a partner, if you're selling software in

929
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:11,889
particular, you'll know that something like a

930
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:12,570
free trial,

931
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,128
uh, some type of ability for the customer

932
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:17,369
to try before they buy is critical to increasing

933
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:19,398
conversion rates and also for customer happiness.

934
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,639
So we're putting a lot of effort into the research

935
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:24,010
phase, whether that's due diligence that might go into an RFQ

936
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,050
or an RFP or the actual trying

937
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,128
it. We have a pilot right now with a demo

938
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,829
you might have seen powered by, um,

939
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:31,750
what's it called? Workspace Studio

940
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,688
to uh actually help you.

941
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,688
Try a full blown demo of the product

942
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:38,688
before before you buy on the back of other features we

943
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:40,728
have like free trials for a long time, so a lot of effort

944
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:41,648
around evaluation

945
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,789
and then streamlining purchasing

946
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,168
we wanna maintain this tension with marketplace where

947
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:48,208
it's disruptive where we're pushing the

948
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,208
industry to new and exciting places in terms

949
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,250
of speed of procurement and that means, you

950
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,530
know, doing some things in new ways, but it also

951
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,570
means being the new normal and working with

952
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,648
normal procurement processes that that need to happen

953
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:00,760
in any company of any size so

954
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,090
we love that tension we love.

955
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:04,478
You know, working with the tools and the process that you have today,

956
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,840
but kind of nudging us all forward

957
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,000
into the future and, and sort of riding that tension.

958
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,090
And a big theme in the last couple of years and

959
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,329
especially the launches that I'll cover today is that it doesn't

960
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:15,458
end at subscribe.

961
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:18,300
Once you buy something and purchase something,

962
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,050
there's actually research from Gartner that says that 25%

963
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,438
of SASS purchases never get used or rarely

964
00:36:23,438 --> 00:36:25,668
get used, and I actually think that's pretty conservative.

965
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:26,898
Just think of your own company.

966
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,228
There's license licenses littering

967
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,639
all of our companies, right, for unused SASS subscriptions.

968
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:34,079
So it's not limited to SASS first of all, but

969
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,219
we, we're putting a lot of effort into how can we increase

970
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,760
buyer retention, renewal rates, etc. and

971
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,699
really just customer happiness by.

972
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,360
Taking it after subscription and setting things

973
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,639
up and like increasing the the value

974
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,099
of what you bought and discovered through the marketplace.

975
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:50,590
So let's go through some of these features.

976
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,168
The bottom line is that when we think about the procurement

977
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,469
phase, if we solve the problems faster

978
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,570
and if we close deals more efficiently, it will mean that you'll

979
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,610
be able to grow more global businesses

980
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,250
more quickly.

981
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,769
Less friction for customers means more business

982
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:07,789
growth and faster velocity. We wanna be

983
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,148
the most strategic channel for partners

984
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:11,559
to, to sell their software,

985
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,699
professional services, and data

986
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:14,679
in the cloud.

987
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,090
We, we've made a lot of progress, but like I said, there's

988
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,050
still work to do, so please bring your feedback to us.

989
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,769
So first of all with discovery I mentioned that we

990
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,378
we segmented both the features that we build and also even

991
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,530
organizationally around the buyer journey,

992
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:31,070
uh, you know, helping customers show up in the first

993
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,250
place to discover your product, helping our reps

994
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,429
discover what product they wanna co-sell

995
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:37,550
with you is critical. So we put a lot of

996
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,628
effort into what we used to call buyer

997
00:37:39,628 --> 00:37:41,869
features, but it's not just buyers, it's, uh, really

998
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,128
just the first phase of the, the discovery

999
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:46,989
and you'll know that search historically

1000
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:49,489
wasn't necessarily the top strength of Marketplace.

1001
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:50,648
That's Matt being polite

1002
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,789
as a Canadian.

1003
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:54,239
Uh, you know, we, we rolled out type

1004
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,909
of head search and I was on stage, um,

1005
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:58,260
talk, telling you how great typehead search, and everyone was like,

1006
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,789
welcome to 2000.

1007
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,320
So, uh, now we have, uh, AI

1008
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,398
powered search which, uh, is actually great. It's

1009
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,398
wonderful. It does things that you expect honestly as a

1010
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,500
buyer these days, things like AI powered summaries

1011
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,039
at the top of the results that help you make,

1012
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,378
uh, to quickly understand what you're about to see.

1013
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,898
And something feedback from you was that the ranking,

1014
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,159
uh, could be improved. So actually the search ranking has

1015
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:17,699
been totally

1016
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,340
we ripped it out and replaced it. We're using actually multiple

1017
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,878
AI models and search algo.

1018
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:24,405
For example, we're using coherent re rank to help

1019
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:26,224
with our search results. We're also using

1020
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:28,293
cloud all through Bedrock

1021
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,034
to help generate those AI summaries. We use Nova

1022
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:32,293
Premiere as well

1023
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,844
for search, so we're multimodal. It all goes

1024
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:35,394
through Bedrock,

1025
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,875
but we've improved our search across a number of vectors.

1026
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,164
We have AI generated categories, so it's no longer

1027
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,784
just fixed categories, it's dynamic categorizations.

1028
00:38:42,844 --> 00:38:43,744
A number of

1029
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:46,603
improvements to search that aren't immediately obvious,

1030
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,043
but what will be obvious is that you can find more

1031
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:50,644
relevant results more quickly.

1032
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,208
And if you're a seller,

1033
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:55,398
hopefully your, your solutions get surfaced

1034
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:57,599
a lot better in, in more relevant

1035
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,559
ways to buyers.

1036
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,000
So a lot of people have been talking about agent mode this week,

1037
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,659
but don't forget

1038
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,179
that AI powered core fundamental search

1039
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,119
is a big change.

1040
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,208
Agent Mondo is, is getting a lot of buzz and rightly

1041
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,610
so. So if you go to the ADBS Marketplace

1042
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,760
page, if you get tired of listening to me, just pull it up on your phone.

1043
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,119
Um, you can see there's a brand new

1044
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
agent mode experience and what agent mode is is

1045
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
a personalized conversational search

1046
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,938
experience for discovering products.

1047
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,800
And this is really important because say you have like detailed

1048
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,030
requirements like an RFP

1049
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,360
or uh technical requirements or just a

1050
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
list of stuff that you want.

1051
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,989
Now you can upload that document. It could be like a PDF

1052
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:33,780
document and we use

1053
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,478
anthropic cloud through Bedrock to parse your

1054
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:38,478
requirements and then auto generate AI

1055
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:40,320
powered product comparisons on demand.

1056
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,070
What's cool about these product comparisons is

1057
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,070
that they incorporate first party data, and by that

1058
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,219
I mean AWS data with third party

1059
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,559
data that we license from providers like Q2 and others,

1060
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:52,050
uh, with real-time insights from the web

1061
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,599
and if you use something called Nova Web Grounding,

1062
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:56,648
which is a service that you can access through Bedrock,

1063
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:58,949
uh, it can actually go ahead and get, it's like Rag, it can go ahead

1064
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:00,469
and get real-time insights on the web.

1065
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,168
So we pull in real-time data

1066
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,639
in addition to the data provided via the LLM, in

1067
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,769
addition to third party data and our own data,

1068
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,329
and we pull all that together and we make a dynamic.

1069
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:12,148
Comparison that corresponds to the requirements

1070
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,228
that you either typed in natural language or that you

1071
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:14,889
uploaded,

1072
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,570
so it's more than just like

1073
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,438
these aren't static requirements.

1074
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,789
We had AI powered product comparisons that I'll show

1075
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,760
in a second that was sort of phase one

1076
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,110
and we had AI powered search that we rolled out with

1077
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,389
the AI agents and tools launch at uh at

1078
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:29,510
New York Summit in July, but this is a whole new

1079
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,550
thing real-time insights, third party

1080
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,478
data, first party data.

1081
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,398
How many of you have ever bought software ever in your life

1082
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,119
for, for a company? Like, I hope so, you're here.

1083
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,340
Um. What, what does

1084
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,378
your boss normally say?

1085
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:42,559
Are you getting a good price?

1086
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,860
Did you look at the other options? Like, are you sure it's

1087
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,760
gonna work, uh, etc. So

1088
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:49,219
we're, we're trying to help you answer those questions

1089
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,219
more quickly and whether that is a formal

1090
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,219
procurement process or just like your boss

1091
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,418
needling you to make sure that you're not getting ripped off,

1092
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:57,398
you need a set of information, right?

1093
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,219
And that takes time.

1094
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:02,159
And candidly, what are most people doing? They're going on a Google

1095
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,159
or a cloud in their pocket and they're doing that research, so

1096
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,199
we're bringing it into the marketplace and putting more structure

1097
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,519
around it and giving you information that you can trust

1098
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,829
so you can make informed buyer decisions.

1099
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,320
There's this thing we talk a lot about internally called buyer's

1100
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,840
regret.

1101
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,320
There's a lot of buyer's regret out of there or people

1102
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,398
that don't do due diligence and then they

1103
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:20,398
buy something and guess what? Like Gartner says, it

1104
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:21,449
sits on the shelf.

1105
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,030
So we wanna help you make better buying decisions so you get

1106
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,659
better value

1107
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,119
out of what you subscribe to and what you buy and to do

1108
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:27,978
that you need data.

1109
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,780
Third party data, 1st party data, real-time

1110
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,958
data from the from the web, and that's what we pulled together

1111
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,860
in agent mode.

1112
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,699
Again, if you get bored of looking at me,

1113
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,219
open your pocket. I hope you have Anthropic cloud, the

1114
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:41,360
app. If you have the pro version, you can add the AWS

1115
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,619
Marketplace. A connector,

1116
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:46,128
it's available today already and you

1117
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,219
can run the agent mode via our MCP server from

1118
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,219
cloud directly or any any

1119
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:51,688
AI tool that supports MCP.

1120
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,329
So you can use our website to run agent mode or

1121
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:56,619
any AI tool that supports MCP that's available

1122
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:57,139
today already.

1123
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,039
Pretty cool because guess what our data already shows

1124
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,418
that yes, we're still getting a lot of organic traffic from

1125
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,619
uh search results. We're getting a ton of organic traffic

1126
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,309
from AI tools.

1127
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:08,699
So now you have first party connectors that

1128
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:10,739
hit our MCP servers that use agent mode and you get

1129
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,889
the same third party reviews with the stars,

1130
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,000
the product comparisons, in any tool of your choice.

1131
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,409
I said this on LinkedIn, if you follow what we call

1132
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:19,659
Matt's roadmap LinkedIn,

1133
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,429
you'll see that it's true. This is a glimpse into the future of

1134
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:26,179
procurement. Just

1135
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,179
to drill a little bit deeper, uh, there's more

1136
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,639
than just the, the, the, the

1137
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:32,139
requirements parsing. We have AI powered

1138
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:34,300
product comparisons and that pulls in, we have 1st and

1139
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
3rd party reviews.

1140
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,309
Uh, we have AI powered, uh, product

1141
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:39,050
review summaries.

1142
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,809
And something that kind of flew under the radar but is super

1143
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,909
important is AI powered pricing insights.

1144
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,168
If you've ever used an enterprise software

1145
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:48,969
product, sometimes the pricing is a little confusing.

1146
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,340
There's a lot of different dimensions that you're priced

1147
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,500
on, and sometimes it's hard to understand.

1148
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,059
I mean, how, how many of you ever in your, in your life received

1149
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:57,800
a bill for a software product that was like, Oh,

1150
00:42:58,289 --> 00:42:58,918
didn't think I'd

1151
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:01,409
be charged like that. Oh, all right, gotta go to

1152
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:03,458
talk to my boss now. We wanna help you

1153
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,898
understand so you don't have to have that conversation with your boss.

1154
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:08,179
That's what uh pricing insights is. It helps you

1155
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,219
make sense of the dimensions and how they translate

1156
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:11,958
translate into what you're actually gonna pay for.

1157
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,329
So we're really trying to simplify things

1158
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:16,449
and you know with the AI powered

1159
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:18,989
translations as well you can see this stuff in

1160
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,179
Japanese or French or you know the language of your

1161
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:23,188
choice as well. So we wanna take that

1162
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:25,228
information, distill it for you, present it in the form

1163
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,179
that you will best consume it with,

1164
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,659
and uh yeah, help you make that informed buying

1165
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,659
decision. So

1166
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:34,739
that's how you find what you buy, but

1167
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:35,820
what about what you buy?

1168
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:37,378
So

1169
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,030
multi-product solutions is something that

1170
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,728
candidly is overdue.

1171
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:44,128
Many of you in the room have asked me for this for

1172
00:43:44,128 --> 00:43:45,389
years, and I can't be

1173
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:47,050
happier to deliver this. We,

1174
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:49,489
this is something that seems so simple, but it's actually very

1175
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:50,989
complex. I'll give you some

1176
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,530
potentially boring unless you're like me and you love tax

1177
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,628
reasons why this is complex. Um,

1178
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,168
professional services like people services are taxed

1179
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,909
differently in most countries than software.

1180
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:02,110
And the way that companies,

1181
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:04,829
uh, I see some of my friends here, you know, selling

1182
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:07,039
enterprise license agreements, for example, that makes things

1183
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,119
complex. You're not necessarily selling a SKU

1184
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,478
per product, you're putting SKUs together. Um,

1185
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,918
the way that buyers buy and sellers

1186
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,119
sell for complicated enterprise

1187
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,360
products can be, can be complicated. So modeling

1188
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,059
these as multi-product solutions,

1189
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:21,978
uh, is, is not trivial.

1190
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:24,929
What if you're buying through a reseller? What if you're buying

1191
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,070
professional services and that that company

1192
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,329
is reselling a bunch of one or more product vendors?

1193
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,449
Who's the lead seller? So we had to think through a lot of

1194
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:32,429
things to get this done

1195
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:34,889
and I'm really proud of what the team has delivered. What

1196
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,978
this is is multi-product solutions,

1197
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,188
but in reality it's actually taking multiple SKUs

1198
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,409
and putting it in a single container. I like to

1199
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:42,378
think of it like a container,

1200
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,969
a single product listing.

1201
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,079
And it's not just like an ad. It's not just

1202
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,398
like a, a static web page that we stuffed

1203
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:50,219
SKUs together.

1204
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,699
First of all, it's a, it's, it's an actual AWBS

1205
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,800
product listing that we can flow through the same

1206
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
recommendation systems that we use for individual

1207
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,699
listings today. So this is critical

1208
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:01,159
because what do we do as an enterprise sales force

1209
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,478
today? We sell solutions now.

1210
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,110
Many of you have sales forces, and that's, that's been the

1211
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,320
thing for years. You're selling industry-based solutions, use

1212
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,559
case-based solutions, horizontal solutions to

1213
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,719
solve specific customer problems. Now

1214
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:12,898
you can do that through the marketplace

1215
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,320
instead of selling.

1216
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,840
As a security solution you can sell

1217
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,418
a zero trust security solution targeted for

1218
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:21,579
global financial services institutions in the United States

1219
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:23,889
and model that as a multi-product solution.

1220
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,458
You can have one or more vendors.

1221
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,280
And one or more products. This could be software software

1222
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,780
software, software services software

1223
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,469
from end vendors.

1224
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,409
The way it works today it's modeled with a lead seller,

1225
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,809
uh, and each

1226
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,188
offer is still a separate SKU, so we

1227
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:42,188
handle that different taxation and different

1228
00:45:42,188 --> 00:45:43,570
sometimes benefits associated with them

1229
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:44,599
behind the scenes.

1230
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:47,269
It's dramatically simplifies the customer

1231
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:49,309
experience because they can accept one offer set and we

1232
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:51,429
take care of setting out those different offers to the different

1233
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:52,530
sellers automatically.

1234
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:55,050
So for the customer it makes it easier to manage things.

1235
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,378
They don't have to kind of manage.

1236
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,769
You still have to sign contracts with the different vendors,

1237
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,128
or rather sign different offers corresponding to

1238
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:01,860
the different vendors,

1239
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,219
but we greatly simplify it for the customers so

1240
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,579
you can close that deal faster.

1241
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:08,139
But most importantly, it unlocks solution-based selling

1242
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:09,579
in a more meaningful way for all of you.

1243
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,570
So this is huge and it actually unlocks a lot of other

1244
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,070
side challenges that I've heard from

1245
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,648
partners

1246
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:18,329
in terms of how you wanna create packages of offerings

1247
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:19,708
together so this is.

1248
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,719
Maybe not so quietly, one of our more

1249
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,739
significant launches,

1250
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,398
and I think there's already 69

1251
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:28,099
or 71 listings live,

1252
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,438
and I expect to see dozens if not hundreds

1253
00:46:30,438 --> 00:46:31,559
more in the coming weeks.

1254
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:35,500
Here's some examples just to sort of make it real.

1255
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,599
I was on stage talking about, uh, uh,

1256
00:46:38,648 --> 00:46:41,019
uh ZScaler ZPA plus MCP

1257
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:43,280
server plus Presidio professional services offer.

1258
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:45,619
Uh, there's a great one from Accenture with Elastic,

1259
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:47,208
for example, with an MCP server.

1260
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,849
some of the many services that are out there.

1261
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:52,300
These are different permutations, but you can do really

1262
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,300
any kind of combination.

1263
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,469
If you squint and look closely at the slide, you'll see something

1264
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,510
near the bottom that's kind of interesting too. What is it? Anyone

1265
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,809
guess? What's connect?

1266
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:03,500
That third party Connect? No, that's an AWS service.

1267
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:06,128
Now there are AWBS service listings in Marketplace

1268
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:06,708
as well.

1269
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,090
Connect

1270
00:47:08,478 --> 00:47:10,688
professional services we have MCP servers,

1271
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,139
uh, we have QuickSuite.

1272
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,458
You're gonna see more AWS services

1273
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,958
now these are listings they're not transacted

1274
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,079
any differently. You still buy them the same way you always did

1275
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,079
like you when you click that, you go to the Connect console and

1276
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,878
you pay for it on your AWbase bill like usual,

1277
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,619
but this is important because it allows you to create packages

1278
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,869
that are both 3rd party, 3rd party, 3rd

1279
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:30,260
party, or 3rd party, 3rd party

1280
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:31,099
AWS.

1281
00:47:31,878 --> 00:47:34,269
So what if you had expert delivery implementation services

1282
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:35,030
plus

1283
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,610
Box, for example, plus QuickSuite.

1284
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,869
Now QuickSuite can have a box connector

1285
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,239
delivered to you by Deloitte. I just made that up,

1286
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:43,869
but that, that's a good example.

1287
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,958
So now you can start to think the gears can start to turn. What

1288
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,090
combinations can you do to meet customers' needs

1289
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,208
of 1st and 3rd party professional services

1290
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,570
plus software. The possibilities are kind of endless.

1291
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:59,090
I mentioned that I think of the multi-product solution

1292
00:47:59,090 --> 00:47:59,989
as a container

1293
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,329
and that we use it for recommendations. This is

1294
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:03,628
important because internally

1295
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:04,750
we also

1296
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:07,289
use algorithms and models to recommend

1297
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,489
the best partner solutions to our reps

1298
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:10,110
to sell.

1299
00:48:10,728 --> 00:48:13,188
We use a CRM from our friends at Salesforce

1300
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:14,110
internally

1301
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:16,688
and we have thousands and thousands of customer

1302
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:17,469
opportunities.

1303
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,478
And I try, my, one of my goals in life is for every

1304
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:22,579
single one of those customer opportunities to have a partner

1305
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:25,239
product or products attached to it.

1306
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:28,099
And we recommend which partner solutions

1307
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:28,829
to attach

1308
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:29,820
automatically.

1309
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:33,019
In every single customer opportunity at at AWS

1310
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:34,619
and now we can recommend

1311
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:38,019
packaged multi-product solutions that are really specific

1312
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,179
to that customer

1313
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,840
directly to the customer opportunity so that increases

1314
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,840
co-sell, increases the number

1315
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,918
of AOs, Amazon originated opportunities, and

1316
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:46,500
ultimately

1317
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,378
better leads so you can create

1318
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:50,619
these packages that will result in

1319
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:53,159
better co-sale and better visibility of your solutions

1320
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:55,239
across customer opportunities in our CRM for all

1321
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:56,340
of our global reps.

1322
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:58,438
So better leverage the power of go to market.

1323
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:00,958
We're I'm just getting started there.

1324
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,519
Match vision, Matt's vision is simple. I want completely

1325
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,739
unbiased recommendations

1326
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,199
that attach your solutions to every single

1327
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,280
customer opportunity with high precision and

1328
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,878
no bias.

1329
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,829
I wanna kind of get, you know, like it's great that you golf with that

1330
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:14,659
person, but that should not be why

1331
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:15,610
we sell with you.

1332
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:17,898
It should be because it's the best solution for the customer

1333
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,239
and, and our models and our statistical models can

1334
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:22,519
take the best of things that you do and

1335
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,519
recommend you into the right customer customer opportunities

1336
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:26,280
because everyone wins in that in that scenario.

1337
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:27,898
That's the goal,

1338
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,139
and we're well on the way.

1339
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:34,340
So this all sounds fine, but you might be thinking, well, Matt,

1340
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:35,478
what are you gonna do about my

1341
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:38,679
massive business operations team to support my marketplace

1342
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:41,409
operations and, and and partner

1343
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:43,539
operations? I have an Ace team. How many of you have an Ace

1344
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:45,099
team? Yeah,

1345
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:46,449
they're, they're kind of shy.

1346
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:48,389
So the goal is, is, you know,

1347
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,809
I love Ace, don't get me wrong, like I own Ace,

1348
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,708
but um,

1349
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,168
you shouldn't have to have a whole Ace team,

1350
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,699
you know, we wanna help those people be way more efficient just

1351
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:57,360
like you shouldn't have to have a whole private offer team.

1352
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,949
Those people could be out there selling those people could

1353
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:01,429
be out there building solutions, right?

1354
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:04,030
They're highly educated, super talented

1355
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,188
cloud people that should be out there in front of customers building

1356
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:08,208
solutions. So the goal here is to

1357
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:11,090
help the, help your AC team, help the marketplace

1358
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,369
operations team be highly efficient, help us all.

1359
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,019
Maybe go home for the weekend early on Friday.

1360
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:18,579
Get to that replay party.

1361
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,699
So right now we have a very healthy

1362
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:23,708
self-service business. In fact, over 80% of all

1363
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,500
transactions in the marketplace are self-service.

1364
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,668
Even though like the big deals

1365
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:30,208
that we're doing with our friends at Salesforce or with CrowdStrike

1366
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,239
or Dabricks, like the large private offers with our

1367
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:34,289
largest sellers, those tend to be custom priced

1368
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:35,090
private offers.

1369
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:37,168
But there's this huge thick middle.

1370
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:40,378
What about all those deals for customers who would

1371
00:50:40,378 --> 00:50:42,139
typically qualify for some kind of a discount?

1372
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:45,168
But, and, and they're kind of too

1373
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:47,139
small to maybe put a big sales team against them.

1374
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,449
Think of like a $10,000 maybe depending on the

1375
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:50,148
size of your company,

1376
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,398
$10,000 might be a lot or, or a little.

1377
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:55,050
Let's say $10,000 50,000 dollars deal.

1378
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,648
You're not gonna have a whole enterprise sales team around a $50,000

1379
00:50:57,648 --> 00:50:58,849
deal. Maybe you will, but.

1380
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,010
You don't want to necessarily from a cost of sales

1381
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:02,849
perspective, right?

1382
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,369
And it's pretty predictable. What if it's like a 2

1383
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:07,489
year renewal with a 5% uplift and the terms

1384
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:08,309
haven't changed

1385
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,969
and nothing else has changed? Like,

1386
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:12,530
do you really need a very smart, expensive

1387
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,320
salesperson to negotiate that?

1388
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,050
No. You know that that's gonna qualify

1389
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,208
for like a 15% discount off your standard rate

1390
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,219
card. So tell

1391
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:21,840
us that

1392
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,769
that's what Express Private offers is.

1393
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,898
You set the parameters. You say, listen,

1394
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:27,320
contract duration X,

1395
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,780
country Y,

1396
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:29,938
customer Z,

1397
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,398
if they meet these criteria, give them this discount,

1398
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:33,958
no human involved.

1399
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,648
That's Express Private Offers.

1400
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:37,659
It automates private pricing.

1401
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:40,679
Private pricing as a service.

1402
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,340
We're not gonna stop there, but this is not a roadmap session,

1403
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:45,699
but we're starting with pricing. But there are other parts

1404
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:46,958
that perhaps we could automate

1405
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:49,099
in these kind of thick middle deals.

1406
00:51:49,378 --> 00:51:51,659
We're just getting started here. This is super exciting.

1407
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,250
Because some customers

1408
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:57,139
demand private pricing, whether

1409
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:59,188
they want to feel special or they actually qualify for it, but it doesn't

1410
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:00,300
matter, you want to make that sale,

1411
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,280
so we

1412
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:03,780
can help automate that and reduce the cost of sales

1413
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,179
and reduce the operational burden.

1414
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,168
While delivering the right discounts or whatever you want

1415
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:09,050
to deliver to customers.

1416
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,219
By the way, I should have said that um.

1417
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,349
We use AI in that too.

1418
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:17,628
So we actually use AI to qualify the customer because

1419
00:52:17,628 --> 00:52:18,329
it's important

1420
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,789
for you to feel confident that you set

1421
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,969
the parameters. You're 100% in control with private offers.

1422
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:25,869
And but you need to know that that person's saying,

1423
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
hey, you know, I'm from Amazon. Like, are you? So we

1424
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,878
use AI to actually qualify that the customer is who they

1425
00:52:30,878 --> 00:52:33,030
say they are and that they meet your criteria before

1426
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,128
we issue that private offer on your behalf with Express

1427
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:36,398
Private offers. That's how it works.

1428
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:40,659
Variable payments is also one of those ones that maybe

1429
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:42,659
not the most exciting title. I should have come up

1430
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,780
with a better feature name for that, but one

1431
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,679
of the most exciting,

1432
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,300
uh, features if you're selling professional services on

1433
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,329
Marketplace, little known fact, 10,000 out of

1434
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:52,378
the 30,000 listings on Marketplace are professional

1435
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,179
services listings.

1436
00:52:53,918 --> 00:52:55,958
But anyone who has a professional services listening may

1437
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,019
tell you that they were only so useful

1438
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:00,458
because we didn't support time and materials like milestone-based

1439
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:01,760
pricing, value-based pricing.

1440
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:02,699
Now we do.

1441
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:04,398
That's what variable payments is,

1442
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,878
which is super important for multi-product solutions

1443
00:53:06,878 --> 00:53:09,269
because now you can have a time and materials-based

1444
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,519
professional services offering combined with software

1445
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,039
wrapped into a multi-product solution.

1446
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:14,829
Think of the possibilities.

1447
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:20,949
International growth, um,

1448
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,438
this is an area where we have made huge

1449
00:53:23,438 --> 00:53:25,438
progress over the last couple of years. Up here on stage, I

1450
00:53:25,438 --> 00:53:27,949
think I was apologizing a couple of years ago for international

1451
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,679
and now I'm not apologizing anymore. I think it's actually our, our

1452
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:32,679
strength. We're doing really well here. We can

1453
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:33,320
save you money.

1454
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,059
Uh, we, we rolled out a number of different

1455
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:38,128
currencies, and this isn't just like FX conversion.

1456
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:39,398
In fact, it's the opposite.

1457
00:53:39,769 --> 00:53:41,849
Uh, we actually have local entities in most of the

1458
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,898
world's major markets now, which means that we can do local

1459
00:53:43,898 --> 00:53:45,898
bills with with local taxation,

1460
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,099
and you can issue the private offer end to end

1461
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,340
in euro or Great British pound or yen or

1462
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:50,860
Korean won

1463
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,559
or Australian dollar.

1464
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,719
Uh, so these are actually

1465
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:55,820
full.

1466
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,599
Internationalization, full local tax compliance

1467
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:00,679
like withholding tax compliance, VAT compliance.

1468
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,079
Though sometimes some countries the bill has to look a certain

1469
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,378
way or else it just doesn't work.

1470
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,119
We actually had to spend engineering effort to move where the VAT

1471
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,969
number was on invoices or like it wouldn't go through.

1472
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,840
But this sounds crazy, but there's some of you who

1473
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,889
understand that if you don't get this right,

1474
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:14,969
it blocks a deal.

1475
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,320
So we do a ton of undifferentiated

1476
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,260
heavy lifting to make

1477
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:22,000
international work and we save you

1478
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
money because if you transact end to end

1479
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,219
in euro, you don't have to backhaul it back to

1480
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,478
the US for example, you don't pay for that currency

1481
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:30,550
conversion. And you know you have to wait

1482
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:33,550
To get dispersed until we collect, right?

1483
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:35,878
What happens if the currency goes down

1484
00:54:36,188 --> 00:54:38,418
from, you know, the time of purchase to disbursement

1485
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:40,780
that, that has burned a lot of people and so we remove

1486
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,860
that by doing end to end transactions in

1487
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,829
local currencies. This is a huge differentiator.

1488
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,260
And if you know, you know,

1489
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,760
if you're, if you're dealing with this, you'll know this is a really big

1490
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,918
deal. Uh, we could support 2% transactions

1491
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:51,619
in Brazil

1492
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:54,148
to get around some, some local tax curiosities

1493
00:54:54,148 --> 00:54:54,719
in that country.

1494
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:57,269
Uh, India, we just launched, uh, Japan, we,

1495
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,719
we released some new things like Japanese consumption

1496
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,719
tax support which is very important if you're doing

1497
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:02,519
business in Japan,

1498
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,539
Australian dollar, euro,

1499
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:06,079
uh, it's all very exciting.

1500
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,639
International is definitely an area of

1501
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,219
strength of marketplace now

1502
00:55:10,478 --> 00:55:12,458
and not just from the US out

1503
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,438
also into the US we have partners like Datamask

1504
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:16,878
who's a very nice CEO

1505
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,579
who are bagging huge deals in the US

1506
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,539
uh from

1507
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:21,579
New Zealand

1508
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,219
and it's amazing that you can have startups outside of the US

1509
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:26,639
getting huge enterprise deals in Europe, in the

1510
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:28,800
US, etc. so it works in both directions.

1511
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:32,840
We got to move faster.

1512
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,079
So we're gonna move quickly.

1513
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:39,070
So we get to deployment though. So what about um

1514
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:41,208
what happens after you subscribe? I, I said this is so

1515
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:43,510
important. It's especially important in agents.

1516
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,070
In July, I mentioned we launched the AI agents

1517
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,168
and tools marketplace.

1518
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,559
Getting to value as a customer is critical,

1519
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,750
and with agents,

1520
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:55,159
it's uh it's one thing to find the agent, but

1521
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:57,199
if you get, for example, that elastic MCP

1522
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:59,360
server from the Accenture multi-product solution.

1523
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:02,809
How do you start to use it and how do you use it securely?

1524
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:06,289
So we support Bedrock Agent Corp

1525
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:08,289
for our new AI agents and tools category, which

1526
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:10,409
by the way has ballooned to over 2000 listings

1527
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,840
now. You can discover both MCP enabled

1528
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,469
agents

1529
00:56:13,728 --> 00:56:15,929
and agentic tools and professional services

1530
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:17,110
for agent implementation,

1531
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:19,500
but for the agents themselves, the MCP agents,

1532
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,570
the API-based agents, what one feature

1533
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,869
that I don't wanna overlook that's super important

1534
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:26,250
is we let customers deploy the agents

1535
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,389
directly from marketplace

1536
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:29,019
into Agent core runtime.

1537
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:31,418
And this is important for a couple of reasons. It can protect

1538
00:56:31,418 --> 00:56:32,250
the partner IP

1539
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:34,619
but allows the customers now with Agent Corres supporting

1540
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:35,289
VPC

1541
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,699
to run those containerized agents securely within

1542
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:38,579
Agent Corre runtime.

1543
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,800
So it allows those agents to scale, to be secure,

1544
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:44,199
and to be set up for use immediately after

1545
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:46,199
purchase. So increasingly

1546
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:47,539
so many of you in the room are thinking

1547
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:50,199
your CIO or CTO is saying, what is your agentic strategy?

1548
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,059
You're building agents like crazy now you can

1549
00:56:52,438 --> 00:56:54,438
sell them to customers through the marketplace and allow

1550
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:56,478
those customers to use them securely more

1551
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:58,800
quickly by marketplace's deep integration

1552
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,789
with Agent Corp runtime

1553
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:00,760
and gateway.

1554
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,128
But not everything is agents yet.

1555
00:57:05,938 --> 00:57:07,949
There's still a lot of sass out there. That's what I'm told.

1556
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,159
It's still the majority

1557
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,898
of, of what we're doing on marketplace and so that's why we

1558
00:57:11,898 --> 00:57:14,418
have a new feature called IAM temporary delegation.

1559
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,780
You probably know what this means inherently,

1560
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:20,329
you know, you probably have a calendar application and you

1561
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:22,369
might have another application that wants read only access to

1562
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:23,648
your calendar for whatever reason

1563
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:26,438
and then you know there's a pop-up that says, do you give this

1564
00:57:26,438 --> 00:57:28,668
application access to your calendar? That's kind of what I

1565
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:30,969
am temporary delegation is. It says, hey, do

1566
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:33,570
you give partner X temporary

1567
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,789
access to your account to do to set up the

1568
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,708
application? This lets our partners set up

1569
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:39,668
sophisticated setup workflows

1570
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,159
so they can set things up, hook up AWS services

1571
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,250
to their product, so you, your customer can get

1572
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,610
value out of that product right away.

1573
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,510
We also have a managed version of this, which is what we launched

1574
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,840
last year with Data bricks and this year with CrowdStrike,

1575
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:53,079
which does a guided step walkthrough.

1576
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,949
That sets the customer up after they make

1577
00:57:55,949 --> 00:57:56,610
the purchase.

1578
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:59,309
So if you have a SAS application, you can use the

1579
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,378
you can use IM temporary delegation to

1580
00:58:01,389 --> 00:58:03,389
reduce churn and to increase time

1581
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:04,030
to value.

1582
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,668
For example, there needs to be like a redshift cluster hooked up to

1583
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:07,719
the SAS application.

1584
00:58:08,148 --> 00:58:10,429
You can do that on behalf of the customer automatically

1585
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,869
using IM temporary delegation.

1586
00:58:15,418 --> 00:58:16,478
I made the joke already,

1587
00:58:16,898 --> 00:58:18,938
uranium 3 and graviton 5

1588
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:20,119
have nothing on PC 3.

1589
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,099
This is a big deal.

1590
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:23,179
Partner Central

1591
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:25,708
has moved to the AWS console. It's a big deal because

1592
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,539
it's not just moving into the console.

1593
00:58:27,878 --> 00:58:30,039
That would be hard but not good enough. It's

1594
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,199
also a whole set of awesome APIs.

1595
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,168
They'll have MCP servers and and

1596
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:36,739
soon agents associated with them.

1597
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,458
If you've worked with Ace and with Partner Central

1598
00:58:39,628 --> 00:58:41,478
or you've ever asked for funding,

1599
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:43,500
now you can do it programmatically.

1600
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:45,918
The benefits API is one of the sleeper huge hits

1601
00:58:45,918 --> 00:58:48,019
here. Now you can make a funding request

1602
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:50,199
and get that, get those credits allocated right

1603
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,199
away without having to pick up the phone and call Julia.

1604
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,739
And that's huge. I mean, Julia is amazing. I, I love. I'll

1605
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:57,739
call Julia every day of the week, but it's a much more

1606
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,898
scalable way to run your business. You can build

1607
00:58:59,898 --> 00:59:00,739
opportunities,

1608
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:02,329
uh, send in leads

1609
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:05,090
all over, uh, you know, restful APIs

1610
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,260
and MCP servers.

1611
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:08,739
You can create solutions in Parts Central. You

1612
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:10,739
can make those funding requests. You can find

1613
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:12,820
other partners through the connections API. We have a

1614
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,099
fully programmable stack, and

1615
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:17,128
it's in the console and it's an ADBS service now,

1616
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:19,619
so you can wrap it in fine-grained IAM permissions.

1617
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:22,489
So that alliance leads, should they be allowed to apply for funding?

1618
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:23,389
Maybe not.

1619
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:26,208
The finance team can have a separate set of fine-grain

1620
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,809
access controls to use the benefits API.

1621
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:30,398
So you can just like you can with other AWBS services,

1622
00:59:30,648 --> 00:59:32,719
you can define who does what in a much more

1623
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:33,289
powerful way.

1624
00:59:35,769 --> 00:59:37,978
Partner revenue measurement in my 10 seconds left here

1625
00:59:37,978 --> 00:59:39,438
because I got excited and went over.

1626
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,969
It is very important because it allows you,

1627
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:43,639
the partner,

1628
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:46,628
to send in telemetry to us to tell us

1629
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,148
how your product is actually

1630
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,728
having impact on the customer accounts and increasingly

1631
00:59:51,728 --> 00:59:54,369
we're going to start to think how can we model incentives

1632
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:56,668
around the true direct and indirect impact

1633
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,090
that your product drives.

1634
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:01,349
So this is very important, especially if you're a services

1635
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,449
partner, a professional services, a consulting partner

1636
01:00:03,628 --> 01:00:05,708
or an ISB partner. It's critical that

1637
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,708
you start to understand what PRM

1638
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,269
or partner revenue measurement is.

1639
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,668
This is telemetry. Instead of just guessing the

1640
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:13,728
impact that we're having with the customers, you can prove.

1641
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:16,590
The impact that you're having both direct and indirect so that

1642
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,909
we can give you the right benefits and model the right incentives

1643
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:20,250
for you, for our sellers,

1644
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,688
and for the customers

1645
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,030
according to the true holistic impact that you're driving.

1646
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:26,309
So we're taking just like we did with Partner Central, a

1647
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:27,668
programmatic approach to partnerships.

1648
01:00:27,949 --> 01:00:30,369
We're now taking a programmatic approach to measuring

1649
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,000
the impact of our partnerships.

1650
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:34,429
If you'd like to learn more about partner revenue measurement,

1651
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:35,929
there's a private bid available.

1652
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:38,570
I'm happy to hook you up with it. Just grab me after the session.

1653
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:43,010
So I'm only a few seconds over.

1654
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:44,500
To recap

1655
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,148
AWS Marketplace,

1656
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:49,898
we've been using AI since 2018 actually. That's

1657
01:00:49,898 --> 01:00:51,898
when Sagemaker Jumpstart, when our model marketplace

1658
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,079
launched. But it's really hit its stride both

1659
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,300
with our AI agents marketplace with over

1660
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,579
2000 listings, but also how we use

1661
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:00,780
AI to power all of the features that we covered.

1662
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:04,050
Solution-based buying with multi-product solutions

1663
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:06,668
and not stopping at subscribe. With IM

1664
01:01:06,668 --> 01:01:07,769
temporary delegation,

1665
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:10,188
with uh Quick launch plus that we have for CrowdStrike

1666
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:10,909
and Data bricks,

1667
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:13,309
we're doing more to help you increase,

1668
01:01:13,949 --> 01:01:16,188
increase conversion but also increase retention and renewal

1669
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:17,989
rates with after you buy.

1670
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,619
And then PC Partner Central 3.0,

1671
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:24,139
uh, a very exciting way to fully automate,

1672
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:26,619
lower your total cost of operations, and ultimately

1673
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,648
move faster because really that's what we're trying to do,

1674
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:30,449
right? We're trying to serve customers faster,

1675
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:32,099
do more for them in a better way.

1676
01:01:34,628 --> 01:01:36,449
So we're here for you. I'd love your feedback.

1677
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:38,989
Um, I would love next year to say, remember when I said how excited

1678
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:40,219
I was, that was nothing.

1679
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:43,780
Like I said, we shipped 27% more features this year.

1680
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,070
We were 31% more efficient thanks to AI and

1681
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,110
my own engineering team. I think we can maybe do

1682
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,409
50% more features next year, but which ones we build

1683
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:52,668
is up to you. So I welcome your feedback. And one

1684
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:53,969
way you can give us your feedback

1685
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:56,708
is like this, it really does help. So please take a moment

1686
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,889
to give feedback. But thanks for your time today. I

1687
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:00,688
I really do appreciate you coming on Thursday night

1688
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,349
and see you on the dance floor later.
