1
00:00:00,418 --> 00:00:01,739
Yeah, thank you very much.

2
00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:03,700
Hi everyone. My name is Gail.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,059
I'm one of the founders of a company

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,078
called Native.

5
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:08,220
Um,

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,579
I'm I'm speaking together

7
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:12,939
today with Sajania, my former colleague

8
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:13,939
from AWS.

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,658
Um, so as mentioned, I used to work for AWS

10
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:18,850
up until a year and a half ago. Prior

11
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,850
to that, um, I was actually leading

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,298
a port called Security Hub.

13
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,510
During my time at AWS I learned

14
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,089
that

15
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,658
cloud providers AWS and

16
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,750
the other ones offer really

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,848
robust security capabilities

18
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:35,289
that customers can use

19
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,469
in order to make sure that their environment

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,649
is secure by design.

21
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,289
I've also learned

22
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:41,348
that.

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,069
While these capabilities are

24
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,118
strong and powerful, it's also

25
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,359
incredibly hard for customers to make

26
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,069
the most advantage out of those.

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,880
So in today's talk, we will talk

28
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,020
about why security by design is important,

29
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,880
about those AWS capabilities

30
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,209
that you can use to achieve security by design.

31
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,848
About the steps to

32
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,969
achieve that and define the guards that

33
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,579
you would like around your environment

34
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:09,888
and finally towards the end about

35
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,088
how what we do at Native

36
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,549
makes this simple, not just at AWS

37
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,888
but actually rather across cloud

38
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:17,540
providers.

39
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:20,189
With that note, I'm gonna pass it to

40
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,418
my friend and colleague Sajania

41
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,790
from the AWS identity team to

42
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:25,969
kick us off.

43
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,510
Perfect. Good morning. Hope you're all

44
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,329
having a wonderful

45
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:31,088
Thursday here at Reinvent.

46
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,769
All right, so let's start with talking about

47
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,790
a scenario that you are all probably

48
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,189
and painfully aware of, right?

49
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,528
Uh, which is your security team came

50
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:43,829
in and said, hey, we want to enforce

51
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,329
encryption on all of my

52
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,049
EBS volumes,

53
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,519
right? And uh your security

54
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,778
team did a scan and identified about

55
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,790
1000 unencrypted volumes,

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,239
right? And here begins what I

57
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,698
call a remediation treadmill,

58
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,159
right? So what happens? You reach

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,439
out to all of the resource owners, try

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,799
to find out who created them.

61
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,564
Why were there encrypted and

62
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,125
then go through the painstaking,

63
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,903
uh, process of encrypting

64
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:15,145
each of these volumes and then also

65
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:17,224
creating an exception list if you have a

66
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,284
legacy application that cannot

67
00:02:19,554 --> 00:02:22,014
that forces you to re-keep the volume

68
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:22,743
unencrypted.

69
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,368
And then spend months together to

70
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:27,788
encrypt all of these 1000

71
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,368
volumes and then you celebrate

72
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:32,588
your success. Hey, you know, you're done with

73
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,308
meeting your security control

74
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,028
and then run another scan and discover

75
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,449
now you have 500 more after 6 months.

76
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,969
So it's a never ending cycle, right?

77
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,368
And that's the nature of detective

78
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:46,969
controls or a detective approach. It's always reactive.

79
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,129
You wait for things to happen and spend.

80
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,538
Expensive resources and

81
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,659
time identifying detecting

82
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,020
these uh gaps and remediating

83
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,319
it and what's furthermore concern

84
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,639
is your organization is at risk

85
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,219
while you're trying to detect and remediate

86
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,300
this. So how about we

87
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,379
flip this and move from

88
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,179
a detective approach to a preventative

89
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:12,649
approach. You put in a policy

90
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,389
saying that going forward,

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,860
no new EBS volumes

92
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,618
would remain unencrypted in your

93
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,879
organization, right? So this is the

94
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,460
premise of secure by design where

95
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,129
you are shifting from a reactive

96
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,338
approach to a preventative approach,

97
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,960
right? So this magically doesn't

98
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,618
remediate all the existing.

99
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,169
Uh, unencrypted volumes, you still have to

100
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,399
clean them up once,

101
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,969
but instead of all your, your security

102
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,909
team spending months of time

103
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,449
performing the same repetitive cleanup

104
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:45,020
job,

105
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,409
they spend a few hours enforcing

106
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,409
a preventative control and then

107
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,449
enforce and your security control

108
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,368
remains intact,

109
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:55,008
right? So a combination, this is the

110
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,449
whole foundation of secure

111
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,610
by design as I mentioned.

112
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,740
Right? And then you repeat

113
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,979
this process, not just for EBS, you

114
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,338
move it to EFS to S3

115
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,538
to KMS and all the other

116
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,679
AWS resources where you want to enforce

117
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,419
encryption by default,

118
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,178
right? So, this

119
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,459
secure by this approach is

120
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,819
not just applicable for configuration

121
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,488
of your AWS resources,

122
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,298
right? This is furthermore or much

123
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,358
beyond configuration.

124
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,509
Uh, it could be, uh, applied to cloud

125
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,569
footprint management.

126
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,259
Where do you want your AWS resources?

127
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,579
Uh, what regions do you want your

128
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,720
users accessing your AWS resources

129
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,759
in, right? So this prevents,

130
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,199
uh, shadow IT creation. Uh,

131
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,319
it could help you enforce your

132
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,108
data residency requirements,

133
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,798
right? Um, and then we also

134
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,059
can apply the same.

135
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,939
Philosophy to external access management.

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,480
Do you have partners?

137
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,459
Do you have secure third party integrations?

138
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:00,319
And you want to enforce your security

139
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,358
controls and requirements for each of

140
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:04,250
these external access patterns.

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,309
Similarly,

142
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,399
moving beyond the configuration,

143
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,678
uh, we at AWS have a

144
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,678
framework called data perimeters which we

145
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,959
will be discussing in a couple of slides.

146
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,750
So when you're enforcing your security

147
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,509
controls beyond configuration,

148
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,329
data perimeter comes into the picture.

149
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,988
And then you have privileged actions, right? You

150
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,189
want, you may have privileged actions like deletion

151
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,189
of databases,

152
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,449
uh, making sure that your security

153
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:31,079
services are not tampered with,

154
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:34,369
and you want to enforce and put preventative

155
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,170
controls for each of these,

156
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,319
uh, domains.

157
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,829
So by implementing secure by

158
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,139
design in each of these domain domains,

159
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,129
you're not just preventing.

160
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,670
And meeting one single

161
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,738
security control, you're creating a

162
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:50,488
secure architecture

163
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,129
across your domains.

164
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,660
Right? And

165
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:55,949
within AWS

166
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,379
we have certain native controls

167
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,639
that can help you

168
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,028
build on your secure design.

169
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,858
The first one is service control policies,

170
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,488
SCPs. I'm sure many of you are familiar

171
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:08,100
with this.

172
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,790
What you do with SCPs is you put in

173
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,358
control saying that, hey, for all my principles,

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,649
whether it be AWS services acting

175
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,730
on my behalf or my

176
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,809
own users, federated users, the

177
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,470
roles that my users assume,

178
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,170
they, I put in a boundary or the maximum

179
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,910
permissions that these principals

180
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,290
can access.

181
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:29,980
And then resource control policies,

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
RCPs work backwards. They come

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,730
in from a resources perspective,

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,199
so irrespective of who's accessing my

185
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,459
resources, whether they are my users,

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,879
whether they are external partner roles, or

187
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,100
any other service acting on my own

188
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,238
uh outside of my organization.

189
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:48,209
I want to control what how they

190
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,369
uh get access my resources and

191
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,369
what resources can be accessed so

192
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,869
that's where you're putting controls on your resources

193
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,829
which are called resource control policies

194
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,209
and then finally declarative policies we

195
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,069
talked about configuration management

196
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:02,750
declarative policies are.

197
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,660
Powerful because you can define

198
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,000
and then enforce the configuration

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
of your AWS resources and services

200
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,838
and we have additional policies

201
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:15,000
like VPC endpoint policies that control

202
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,459
what gets in and outside of your

203
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:19,000
network, resource based policies

204
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,459
and identity policies.

205
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,309
So using these,

206
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,220
uh, constructs,

207
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,649
for example of the scenario that

208
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,689
we talked about where we want to enforce

209
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:30,588
encryption,

210
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,309
we have a couple of policies.

211
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,170
You can always refer to these policies from her

212
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,309
GitHub, but the

213
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,309
the gist of these policies is

214
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,899
you're denying the creation

215
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,480
of EC2 volumes here,

216
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,069
the volume create volume call

217
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,528
if the encrypted con easy to encrypted

218
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,189
condition is false, so you're preventing

219
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,649
creation of any new volumes without encryption.

220
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,100
At the same time, you're also

221
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,298
preventing anybody from tampering

222
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,298
account level encryption setting, the default

223
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:02,420
setting. So similarly, you can

224
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,980
take the same pretext to EFS

225
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,379
where you are denying creation of file

226
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,670
systems or updating file systems if

227
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,660
the encrypted condition is false.

228
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,119
And then you can extend this for to

229
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,040
other AWS resources as well.

230
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:18,439
So the, the philosophy is the same. You're

231
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,309
trying to enforce the similar pattern

232
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,230
but for multiple resources.

233
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,678
Here's where the complexity increases as

234
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,709
you see the conditions, the

235
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,720
actions that you want to take care of

236
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,730
and control are different,

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
so you have to carefully craft each

238
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,538
of these policy types

239
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,928
for each of the AWS resources

240
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,149
and service types and need to know them.

241
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,479
And you have to design them such a way

242
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,619
that these do not block or interrupt

243
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,700
your existing business workflows at

244
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,639
the same time

245
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,178
implement your security controls.

246
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,820
So yes, this can be done, but

247
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,940
you need to understand and learn about

248
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,178
each of these services and the actions

249
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:58,359
that you need to control.

250
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,879
So we talked about data perimeters and

251
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,869
you, we have a whole,

252
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,979
uh, GitHub report where you can refer to the data parameters

253
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,000
so you do not have to start from scratch,

254
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,408
right? So in essence what you're doing

255
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:13,649
here is you are defining

256
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,330
perimeters.

257
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,918
So you're building a perimeter around your identity

258
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:17,808
saying that, hey.

259
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,484
Only trusted identities can access my

260
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:21,104
resources

261
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,724
and only trusted identities are

262
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:25,474
allowed from my networks, right?

263
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:27,844
Similarly for resources you're

264
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:30,264
saying my identities can only

265
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:32,844
access my resources or the trusted resources

266
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,844
that I know of and only from the

267
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:35,984
trusted networks

268
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,604
and from a network perspective

269
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,724
you're saying, hey, you know, I don't want anyone else

270
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:41,625
bringing in their

271
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:43,955
private credentials or personal credentials

272
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,114
and accessing from my network or through my

273
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:48,250
network. So all of these are

274
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,369
enforced through uh the policy types

275
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,808
that we talked about the RCPs, SEPs,

276
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,250
VPC, endpoint policies, and a plethora

277
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,690
of the conditions that we have.

278
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,440
The gist of this is this can be done,

279
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,849
but the complexity is that you have

280
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,889
to perfectly balance and create

281
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:04,869
a harmony

282
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,729
between the types of policies achieved that that

283
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,750
are shown here.

284
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:11,330
It, and that's where the complexity

285
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,369
of implementing secure

286
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:15,168
by design comes into place.

287
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,719
And this is only, we are talking about in

288
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:18,580
AWS

289
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,719
and but the

290
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,830
The complexity increases when it gets beyond

291
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,048
AWS and Gail,

292
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,359
do you want to talk about that?

293
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,489
Yeah, absolutely.

294
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,989
So thank you again for presenting this. I

295
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:31,418
couldn't have done it any better,

296
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,428
but

297
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,710
really to the point that we had.

298
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,330
Security by design is about enforcement.

299
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,428
It's about building an environment that's

300
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:41,440
always secure,

301
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,908
and the way to do that both in

302
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:46,149
AWS but also in other cloud

303
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:46,849
providers

304
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,700
is relying on the native

305
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,369
built-in

306
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,590
controls and security policies. That's why

307
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,029
our company is called Native.

308
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,658
As I mentioned, I used to work for AWS,

309
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,739
so I saw firsthand how

310
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:00,440
this is built

311
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:01,489
and baked.

312
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,418
We saw that the built-in native capabilities

313
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:06,460
can help customers enforce

314
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,580
things at the source, no matter whether

315
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,359
they go through

316
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,619
a pipeline or the console or for some

317
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,700
other mechanism.

318
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,099
It can help.

319
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,500
It does the enforcement with zero

320
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,580
latency. It's built for scale as

321
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,139
you add more and more and more accounts into your

322
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,450
organization. The policy would still be enforced

323
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,109
and would be enforced all over the place

324
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:26,428
and so on.

325
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:28,629
It gets to a level where

326
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,320
Amy Herzog, the CISO of AWS,

327
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,489
has said herself that the fastest

328
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,570
path to better security, to security

329
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,279
by design,

330
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,808
is using the protections that are built

331
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,149
into the environment.

332
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,450
And while this quote comes from the

333
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,210
CISO of AWS,

334
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,668
there are similar quotes on the internet

335
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:49,330
from the CISOs of all of the other

336
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,428
cloud providers.

337
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:52,940
But

338
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,619
I also know that making the most out of these built-in

339
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,950
mechanisms is complex.

340
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,460
So Janya herself showed you all of

341
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,658
the different condition keys and

342
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,239
policy types and so on,

343
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:06,099
and it, it's, it's a puzzle

344
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,908
that you need to go and build around.

345
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,219
It's, these are basically Lego bricks

346
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,219
and then this was just a WS

347
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,619
and now those things work differently

348
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:17,019
in Asia and GCP and so on. And

349
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,849
this is really where Native comes in.

350
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,418
So we've worked with countless

351
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,820
security architects, cloud security teams,

352
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:26,340
platform teams, and we've identified that

353
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,558
the process to

354
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,940
go and define those controls goes all

355
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,580
the way from discovery.

356
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,509
To planning the rollout to simulating

357
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,548
it all the way to

358
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,750
implementing them and operationalizing those

359
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,450
controls.

360
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:42,279
So you start with discovery, the effective policy,

361
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,070
what's currently at stake,

362
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,668
talking about security outcomes and translating

363
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,830
that you move to planning. What

364
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,830
do I actually want to enforce? How do I want to

365
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,469
enforce that? What's the rollout?

366
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,989
You then go on to the simulation. How

367
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,590
is this gonna impact my resources?

368
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,940
It goes on to implementation.

369
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,599
Just perimeter policies,

370
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,879
network perimeter policies on AWS

371
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,200
can be 30+ policy statements.

372
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,840
We go and do the translation for you, not

373
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,158
just into those two SEPs that Saljania

374
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,099
showed earlier,

375
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:14,859
but rather to

376
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,779
many more and different types of policies

377
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,239
and go all the way into giving you the implementation

378
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:22,359
instructions and the rollout and so on and so

379
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,440
forth. And finally

380
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,460
operationalizing what's the effect of the policy,

381
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,599
exception requests and so on and so

382
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,139
forth.

383
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,139
The point is that

384
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,678
this entire cycle that's made

385
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,158
simple for the platform

386
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:37,639
really allows you to go in and

387
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,340
ensure security by design.

388
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,918
It allows you, to my point from earlier on,

389
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,500
be secure the source itself,

390
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:46,399
build, operate environments that are secure

391
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,038
by design.

392
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,019
It allows you to unify your government,

393
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
your governance policies and your

394
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,889
governance processes

395
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,678
and manage policies across different cloud

396
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:58,139
providers from a single location.

397
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,599
So if you're AWS experts, but

398
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,428
you also have Asio and GCP,

399
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,158
you don't need to become experts in those clouds,

400
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:08,229
in those clouds. You can just take your existing policies,

401
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,599
hit a button, they would be enforced or

402
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,558
vice versa.

403
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,349
It gives you the end to end

404
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,038
operationalization capabilities,

405
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:18,899
what has been blocked by the policy, exceptions

406
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,099
management, drift, many more,

407
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,330
and it gives you adaptive coverage

408
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,548
cloud providers, I know this, I worked

409
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:26,590
for AWS,

410
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,048
they launch consistent

411
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,570
updates to.

412
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:31,849
The platform,

413
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,428
new APIs, new capabilities,

414
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,029
we go in and provide those updates as

415
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:39,259
things are being updated, as your cloud changes,

416
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,509
as your business needs evolve, we

417
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,489
allow you to

418
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:43,808
quickly adapt.

419
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,340
With that, I hope that was

420
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,259
a clear introduction into

421
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,038
why security by design is important,

422
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,639
why it is hard, but also how we can

423
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,379
be of help.

424
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,308

Odo, to my colleague Sajania,

432
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,969
um, or to any

433
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,190
other colleague that I have that you'll meet at
