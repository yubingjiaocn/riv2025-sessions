1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,940
- Quick show of hands.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,214
Who here has tried to scale AI adoption

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,350
across a large organization

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,953
and found it much harder than
the blog posts make it sound?

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,385
Exactly.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:19,170
Prime Video and AWS have
been right there with you.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,560
And today, James and I are here to share

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,980
lessons, challenges, and breakthroughs

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,310
that led us from isolated AI experiments

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,083
towards AI native transformation.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,190
I'm Lilia Abaibourova,

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,440
a technical product
manager with Prime Video.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,250
Unlike most traditional PM roles

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,530
that focus on customer-facing features,

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,503
my role is on developer experience.

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,010
All of Prime Video
developers are my customers

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,320
and my team obsesses over metrics

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,450
like internal tool satisfaction

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,063
and average revisions per code review.

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,280
Last year, I started an AI
enablement program in Prime Video

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,840
and I'm excited to share the journey

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,580
of how we went from AI system adoption

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,440
towards AI native transformation.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,440
So today we will start with
what we mean by AI native.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,250
Then, James will take you on a journey

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,160
of how he accidentally sparked

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,790
a company-wide movement

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,363
of AI adoption.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,410
I will cover organizational transformation

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,630
and measuring outcomes,

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,580
and we will end with a really fun demo.

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,800
But before, just to set the stage

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,183
a bit about Prime Video.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,790
Here on the screen,

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,730
you see some of our global reach numbers

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,590
as well as fun highlights

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,773
from recent Prime Video
Studios original content.

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,480
We have thousands of other
titles in our catalog

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,813
from Prime Video Studios as
well as our channel partners.

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,550
And of course, we're big into live sports.

41
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,390
Last Friday, we streamed
an NFL football game,

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,640
two NBA games,

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
all running smoothly

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,653
during one of the biggest
retail days of the year.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,050
What's behind all of these?

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,220
Hundreds of developers
innovating constantly

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,540
on behalf of our customers

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,483
and making sure everything
is working smoothly.

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,440
That scale and complexity

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,870
is where AI native transformation

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,243
can really bring massive impact.

52
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,870
Last year, I was here at re:Invent

53
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,760
and I shared a journey

54
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,620
of our early AI coding
assistant adoption in 2024

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,990
as it became...

56
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,710
as it evolved from an apprentice assistant

57
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,693
towards an expert assistant.

58
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,380
This year, we are here to
talk about the next step

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,403
in that evolution,

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,913
AI native development transformation.

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,653
But what do we mean when we say AI native?

62
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:14,760
It is fundamentally different

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,565
from the AI-assisted development process

64
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,013
that most organizations practice today.

65
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Think about a typical workflow with AI.

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,060
You might get requirements for a feature

67
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,530
and paste them into AI chat

68
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,400
to brainstorm a potential
architecture approach.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,840
Once you land on something,

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,130
you paste more context into an IDE

71
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,880
and write code.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,370
Some of it is generated with autocomplete,

73
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,490
some of it is written by hand.

74
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,800
Eventually, once the feature is ready,

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,310
you might paste more
context into another tool

76
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,670
to create documentation
or a launch announcement.

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,730
So we use tools like autocomplete

78
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,250
and AI chatbots constantly,

79
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,520
but we use them in ad
hoc and isolated manner,

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,133
pasting context between
them all along the way.

81
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,850
The impact of productivity

82
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,153
is on individual productivity
and isolated tasks.

83
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,240
AI native is a fundamentally
different approach

84
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,793
where we reimagine how we build software.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,769
AI tooling is embedded throughout
each step of the process

86
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,950
of software development

87
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,280
and every role, PMs,
developers, designers,

88
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,453
are enabled with AI.

89
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,710
Instead of autocomplete, we rely on agents

90
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,570
that can own multi-step
workflows end to end

91
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,450
and context is embedded and shared

92
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,780
throughout the tooling and infrastructure

93
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,643
and goes throughout teams as well.

94
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,680
And that's what leads

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,043
to organizational
productivity transformation.

96
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,270
But like all transformations,

97
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,720
it didn't start with a top-down mandate.

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,390
It started grassroots

99
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,347
with builders experimenting, sharing.

100
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,843
And James is here to tell
us about that journey.

101
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,490
- Thanks, hey there.

102
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,960
My name is James Hood.

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,990
I'm a principal software
engineer at Amazon.

104
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,240
I've been with the company for 16 years,

105
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,280
most of that time spent in AWS.

106
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,960
I did do about a five-year stint

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,690
in retail fulfillment
software in the middle,

108
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,377
but again, vast majority
of my time has been at AWS.

109
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,540
Now I am a principal engineer

110
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,053
and I'm also a former AI skeptic.

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,970
I don't know what your
experience has been like with AI,

112
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,170
but my previous experience
looked something like this.

113
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,630
I would see some flashy AI demo,

114
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,600
it would look mind blowing and exciting.

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,430
I would then try to use it myself

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,170
on real software problems

117
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,690
and I would find that the tools

118
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,217
just fell over, really struggled,

119
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:09,780
and it left me feeling very skeptical.

120
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,490
Now memes are my love language.

121
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,170
So I have this slide up here.

122
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,650
But if you wanna look at another way,

123
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,110
I was in a cycle

124
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,430
where this demo would spark
curiosity and excitement,

125
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,560
which would lead me to experiment.

126
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,800
I would end up with
failure or disappointment.

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,090
And then, I would be in a
skeptical state after that.

128
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,710
Then maybe another demo came up,

129
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,110
which took me around
that loop one more time.

130
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,910
But it doesn't take many
times around the loop

131
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,290
before it's really difficult

132
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,790
to get somebody from skepticism

133
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,760
back to that curiosity phase.

134
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,140
So what changed?

135
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,090
Well, a number of things changed.

136
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,560
Reasoning models got better,

137
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,820
introduction of MCP,

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,350
so different technical
innovations happened.

139
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,860
But for me, my big aha
moment came when I realized

140
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,170
that, you know, these
large language models

141
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,913
that back these systems,

142
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,630
they're kind of these
mysterious black boxes

143
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,150
and depending on how you
prompt them and use them.

144
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,010
They have these emergent behaviors

145
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,610
that were not intentionally designed in.

146
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,290
And what I realized,

147
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,380
I read a lot of tech articles constantly,

148
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,910
and I came across some articles

149
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,840
that describe some techniques
that I was able to reproduce.

150
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,300
And when you take the tools

151
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,310
and you combine them with the techniques,

152
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,890
that is this journey toward becoming

153
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,443
what I call a gen AI power user.

154
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,820
My first major success story

155
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,830
was using these techniques

156
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,620
to build a feature at the time

157
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,770
into Amazon Q Developer CLI.

158
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,707
I built a major feature into that tool.

159
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:52,275
I'm not on their team,

160
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,830
I'm not familiar with their codebase,

161
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,020
and it's written in a language
that I didn't even know

162
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,980
at the time,

163
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,425
and I went from concept to
pull request in two days,

164
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:06,093
and it went from concept to
production launch in seven days.

165
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,490
And I'm gonna show you
exactly how I did it.

166
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,496
So one of the constant narratives

167
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,430
that I hear around AI

168
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,577
is I tried to use this AI tool.

169
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:23,040
And yeah, it generated a lot
of code very, very quickly.

170
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,060
But when I looked at it,

171
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,140
I didn't like the code,

172
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,000
I ended up having to change it a lot.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,670
And by the time I'd done all of that work,

174
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,823
maybe it was just faster
to do it myself manually.

175
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,820
Now the fallacy in this argument

176
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,720
is that essentially you
gave it a rough, vague idea

177
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
and you had to go to a very
precise implementation.

178
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,650
And I will tell you,

179
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,020
if you remove AI from that scenario

180
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,940
and you substitute a human in

181
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,620
and you do the exact same thing to them,

182
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,350
you're gonna get the exact same result.

183
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,570
That's because software
development is a process.

184
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,400
We have decades of experience

185
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,180
that to go from a rough
idea to implementation,

186
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,050
you have to go through a process

187
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,620
that requires research and
requirements clarification.

188
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,180
You need to design a solution,

189
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,610
you need to create an implementation plan,

190
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,110
and then you can implement,

191
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,253
and that's going to increase
your chances of success.

192
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,270
So I was able to leveraging
these techniques,

193
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,710
use AI as a way to speed
run me through this process.

194
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,186
So the first step is to
research the codebase.

195
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:28,560
I'd come up with this rough
concept for what I wanted.

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,900
I had written a little, a short doc.

197
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,870
I'd even shared it with the Q CLI team

198
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,010
and they said, "Yeah,

199
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,750
I think you're onto something with that."

200
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,070
It was a Friday.

201
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,810
My wife was outta town for the weekend.

202
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,656
I went home and it wasn't
just some like idea I had,

203
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,670
like this feature was really blocking me.

204
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,410
Like, I really wanted
to have this feature.

205
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,080
And I thought why not just
create a proof of concept?

206
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
So first step is to research the codebase.

207
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,480
So I downloaded the codebase

208
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,730
and, at the time, opened up Q CLI,

209
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,130
and I just said, what is this codebase?

210
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,010
And it went through and the
file system searched through

211
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,710
and it told me a little
bit about the codebase.

212
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,460
It said it has these main components

213
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,530
and one of 'em was the q chat component.

214
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,510
And I knew that was the
one I wanted to change.

215
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,210
So I said: Do more research
on the q chat implementation

216
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,830
and give me a summary.

217
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,673
And it did.

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,980
And I said, okay great,

219
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,390
create a directory called planning

220
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,860
and write this summary information

221
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,113
to a file called codebase.md.

222
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,560
And it did and it did a really good job.

223
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,200
Now I knew I wanted to
add a new slash command.

224
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,170
So I said: write a file
in the planning folder

225
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,490
called slashcommand.md

226
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,890
covering how slash
commands are implemented.

227
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,110
Include enough details so
a developer could implement

228
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,260
a new slash command
using this information.

229
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,820
And it did.

230
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,970
And I looked through and
did a pretty good job.

231
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,900
I said, great.

232
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,250
Researching the codebase, done,

233
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,870
that was five minutes.

234
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,930
Next step, clarify requirements.

235
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,910
Now this is something
I got from an article,

236
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,860
but I had put my rough idea
doc into this Markdown file.

237
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,050
And I said: Read rough-idea.md.

238
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,430
Ask me one question at a time

239
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,600
so we can develop a thorough,

240
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,150
step-by-step spec for this idea, kind of.

241
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,340
And the prompt had a
little bit more to it.

242
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,380
If you think I'm hiding
some magic from you

243
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,570
or you're eager to take
pictures of these prompts

244
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,890
so you can copy and paste them,

245
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,140
I have a demo that is coming later

246
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,390
where you don't even
need to do that anymore.

247
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,870
But what this did was it turned
the agent into this partner

248
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,900
that would ask me questions
like it asked me, you know,

249
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,220
what specific problem are you trying

250
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,750
to solve with this feature?

251
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,070
And I would answer it

252
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,100
and it would ask me just
clarifying questions.

253
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,212
Sometimes, I didn't always have the answer

254
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,180
or I didn't always need
to have the answer.

255
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,310
Sometimes for example, it said,

256
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,125
how do you want the sub command structure

257
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,700
to look with this?

258
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,840
Do you want to use flags?

259
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,310
Do you want to use git style?

260
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,860
And well, first, it asked me the question

261
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,780
and I just said gimme some options.

262
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,160
And so then it said, okay,

263
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
you could use git style subcommands,

264
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
you could use parameters.

265
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,120
It gave me some options and I said,

266
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,650
I like that one but tweak it this way,

267
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,113
and that's the answer
that went into this file.

268
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,350
So after about 24 questions,

269
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,520
I realized we were getting

270
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,500
to the end of requirements clarification

271
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,480
because it started
asking me questions like,

272
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,684
should I implement it like this?

273
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,795
And it just starts
spitting code out at me.

274
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:13,753
And I said, okay,

275
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:16,410
I think we're done with
requirements clarification.

276
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,540
So at this point, I'm like 40 minutes in.

277
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,000
Again, I thought I was doing
a proof of concept at the time

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,410
so I was just kind of like quickly trying

279
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,000
to get through this.

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,683
So the next step is design.

281
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,100
And I said based on all
the planning docs so far,

282
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,690
created detailed design document

283
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,290
so a developer can immediately
begin implementation.

284
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,400
And it did.

285
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,505
And I read through that design doc.

286
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,644
Again, I thought it was a proof of concept

287
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,310
so I kind of quickly skimmed.

288
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,795
I went back and forth a little bit with it

289
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,670
and had to correct some things

290
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,820
and maybe made some
manual edits to it myself.

291
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,070
But at that point, we're
ready for implementation plan.

292
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,773
I'm about an hour into this process.

293
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,400
So again, this is something
I took from an article

294
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,830
and it says convert the
implementation plan.

295
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,890
So the design doc had an
implementation plan section

296
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,370
into a series of prompts
for a code generation LLM.

297
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,670
They'll implement each step
in a test-driven manner.

298
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,863
And there was more to it.

299
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:11,850
It was, you know, make sure each step

300
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,220
takes a meaningful step and
is kind of self-contained

301
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,630
and there is more to it.

302
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,920
But again, if you're stressing

303
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,180
that I'm not sharing the prompts,

304
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,530
I'm not trying to be secretive,

305
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,080
I have a much better solution
for you coming later.

306
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,073
But it followed what I said

307
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:28,680
and it came up with
this like 14-prompt plan

308
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,923
to implement step by step this feature.

309
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,010
I also had it generated a to-do list

310
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,503
so that it could keep
track of where I was.

311
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,763
And finally, we're ready
for implementation.

312
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,300
So my next step was to say,

313
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,150
read all the documents
in the planning folder

314
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,830
and implement prompt
one from the prompt plan

315
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,710
and update the to-do with progress.

316
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,970
And it did.

317
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,200
And then I said, great,

318
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
read the planning folder again
and implement prompt two.

319
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,940
And it did it.

320
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,900
After prompt two,

321
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,460
I had to figure out how
to build the package

322
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,420
'cause I actually didn't even,

323
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,643
like, I really didn't know this codebase.

324
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,755
So it took me a little bit
figured out how to build it,

325
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:12,526
actually had the agent
help me a little bit

326
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:13,920
with how to build it.

327
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,630
And once I got it building,

328
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,920
I was able to kinda start it up

329
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,240
and test a little bit.

330
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,490
I think I got to prompt five or so.

331
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,576
And the reason this context
feature was even needed

332
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,470
was 'cause I need,

333
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,960
I had to keep saying like
reread the planning folder

334
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,388
and I wanted a way to pin it,

335
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:30,660
pin certain files,

336
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,610
and that's what the context feature was.

337
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,020
So by the time I got to prompt five,

338
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,750
I was able to like start
it up with my feature.

339
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,730
And then, I used my feature
to build the rest of it,

340
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,780
which was pretty fun.

341
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,777
So, this was a pretty
mind blowing experience

342
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,730
for me to go through.

343
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,493
And this success,

344
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:52,830
this initial success and these techniques,

345
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,150
got me very excited.

346
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,852
And what I'll say now,

347
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:59,190
as compared to that vicious cycle earlier,

348
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,120
is I'm now in what I call
this AI native virtuous cycle

349
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,512
where I hear about something new

350
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,320
or I try some new technique

351
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,170
and I have a lot of
curiosity around these tools,

352
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,733
I experiment with them.

353
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,808
successes and failures regardless,

354
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,670
I share my learnings with others.

355
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,190
And then, one thing I
always like to point out

356
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,105
is that I think both the
healthy virtuous cycle

357
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:27,115
as well as the vicious
cycle involves skepticism.

358
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:30,465
I don't have to tell you
all that, you know, AI,

359
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:35,465
there's a lot of noise
around AI externally.

360
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,490
And so I do think that
having a healthy skepticism

361
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,660
is an important part

362
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,860
of getting in this AI
native virtuous cycle

363
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,560
and making sure you set your expectations

364
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,740
and be curious, test things out.

365
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,840
But don't assume just because
some things don't work,

366
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,490
that the whole thing is worthless.

367
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,630
There's really big value
to be used in these tools.

368
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,790
So after this experience,

369
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,900
I felt this tremendous sense of urgency

370
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,563
to spread this knowledge
across the company.

371
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,110
And what I did was I created
a Slack channel internally

372
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,920
and it's called
amazon-buildergenai-power-users.

373
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,640
And that channel has grown
beyond my wildest imagination.

374
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,710
This was just in March
that I created this.

375
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,120
I can't share exact numbers,

376
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,150
but there are literally
tens of thousands of members

377
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,210
of this channel with
people around the company

378
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,923
who it started with my
story that I had shared.

379
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:36,480
But now, we have this
massive grassroots movement

380
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,530
of people who are actively
working out different techniques

381
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,140
and sharing their learnings
and sharing different tools

382
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,267
and it's been an incredible experience.

383
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:50,192
One last note that I
wanna say about this story

384
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:53,880
that I told is, you know,

385
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,740
one differentiation I like to make

386
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,490
between vibe coding
versus what I was doing,

387
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,550
which I consider AI native
software development,

388
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,713
is that if all I did was say implement

389
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:09,090
prompt one through 14 and that was it,

390
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,420
then it would've taken
me two hours, right?

391
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,160
But I said it took me two days

392
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,780
to put up this pull request.

393
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,006
And as true as it is that
I don't know the language

394
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,070
of this repository that I was working in,

395
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,830
I've also been programming
for over two decades.

396
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,936
So while I can't fluently write that code,

397
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:30,780
I could read what was going on roughly.

398
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,240
I was following along
as it was implementing.

399
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,170
I was making-

400
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,270
I was going back and forth with the agent,

401
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,880
like questioning aspects of the code

402
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,140
and using, leveraging my
human judgment and experience

403
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,780
to make sure that we were
headed in the right direction

404
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,623
the whole time.

405
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,240
So I think that's a really
important distinction to make.

406
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,450
Now this movement

407
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,640
that happened internally in the company

408
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,700
and is still ongoing is,
again, very exciting.

409
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,590
I don't think that you can succeed

410
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,150
in AI native transformation

411
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,480
without this kind of
grassroots energy and movement

412
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,230
and excitement from
your builder community.

413
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,250
However, transformation
has to come both from-

414
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,440
you can't rely purely on bottoms-up

415
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,900
and you can't rely purely on top-down.

416
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,730
It's a mix of both.

417
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,710
And so I'm gonna hand it back to Lilia

418
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,179
to talk about some of the
organizational support

419
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,600
that was given to help continue

420
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,003
that transformation
based off of this energy.

421
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,020
- Thank you, James.

422
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,250
So James shared

423
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,960
how he sparked a grassroots movement,

424
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,910
but grassroots movement needs

425
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,510
organizational support to scale.

426
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,610
We found that to support

427
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,670
a large-scale adoption program like this,

428
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,873
you need three pillars:

429
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,730
access and infrastructure to make sure

430
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,190
all teams and roles

431
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,710
are getting access to
best in class AI tools

432
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,043
and there is no friction with
access to context, et cetera.

433
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,113
Second is culture and learning.

434
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,580
We learn that becoming AI native requires

435
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,630
this type of learning
flywheel that James showed

436
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,763
should become part of the culture.

437
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,623
And finally, trust and rigor.

438
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,713
So this is where we make sure that, sorry,

439
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,360
there are controls and governance built in

440
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,243
at every layer of the
stack and every process.

441
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,260
These three pillars reinforce each other

442
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,860
and we'll go deep into each one.

443
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,223
So let's start with AI
access and infrastructure.

444
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,170
Software development involves
cross-functional teams

445
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,760
of product managers,
designers, developers,

446
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,040
to take product through phases

447
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,460
from ideas to coding,

448
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,750
to deployment, operating, learning,

449
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,883
which is where new ideas come in.

450
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,360
This is the sequence we commonly refer to

451
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,123
as software development lifecycle OSDLC.

452
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,470
Up till now, AI-assisted
processes and tools

453
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,960
have accelerated primarily

454
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,413
the coding and testing
part of this process,

455
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,050
offering code suggestions,

456
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,880
generating unit tests,

457
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,223
spitting up individual programming tasks.

458
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,423
AI native methodology goes beyond coding.

459
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,153
It fundamentally reimagines
how we build software.

460
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,970
James walked us through how he used Q CLI

461
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,123
to clarify requirements, design solution,

462
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,710
and we have scaled it
from individual workflow

463
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,943
to team productivity.

464
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,790
Every phase of the software
development lifecycle

465
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,810
and every role has embedded AI support

466
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,190
with some shared tooling,

467
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,603
some customized tooling.

468
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,260
And let me just walk you through
a couple of the tools here

469
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,463
as some of the terminology
might be new as of recent,

470
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,710
Kiro is an AI native development agent.

471
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,910
It has both ID and CLI interfaces.

472
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,710
And what we've been excited about

473
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,810
is that it's been gaining traction

474
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,460
not just without developers

475
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,790
but also PMs and designers.

476
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,639
We use it for prototyping ideas

477
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:02,490
and that way we can accelerate
some of the early phases

478
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,140
of the software development lifecycles

479
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,720
so we're not blocked on engineering teams

480
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,670
to help us with the initial prototypes.

481
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,850
We also are able to use Quick Suite,

482
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,850
which is the business intelligence agent,

483
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,970
and it helps us with
researching requirements,

484
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,730
learning from past
experiments, analyzing data,

485
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,800
and quickly creating

486
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,900
automating agentic workflows for business.

487
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,390
But beyond that,

488
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,970
many teams have been building

489
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,806
tailored agents and solutions

490
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:37,470
that are more customized

491
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,070
for their domain codebase and problems.

492
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,130
So for example, we've built test agents

493
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,082
to be able to automate
testing and quality validation

494
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:52,263
across hundreds of devices
that Prime Video supports.

495
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,210
And similarly, we have
operational agents that use AI

496
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,125
and hundreds of data sources that we have

497
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,437
to be able to diagnose, troubleshoot,

498
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:06,341
and sometimes even suggest solutions

499
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,463
for operational issues and incidents.

500
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,960
And what connects all of this

501
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,750
is shared context and capability layer

502
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,510
where we use knowledge bases

503
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,820
and model context protocol

504
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,084
to make sure that all roles
can share the same context

505
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,969
without needing to paste it

506
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,620
between different steps and tools.

507
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,910
So for example, when a
product manager creates a spec

508
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,690
with an AI assistant tool

509
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,980
that's best for spec
requirement development,

510
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,100
that becomes available to
our development team in Kiro

511
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,890
via an MCP integration.

512
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,030
And then as they build
the code and merge it,

513
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,240
that code becomes available
to operational agents to use

514
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,000
as part of the context
along with metrics, logs,

515
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,173
and other data sources.

516
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,590
So how did we build this stack and enable

517
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,523
the context sharing all the way through?

518
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,430
At the foundation, we of
course built everything on AWS.

519
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,470
So building blocks like identity

520
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,903
and access management,
compute, observability.

521
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:21,720
For the model and capability layer,

522
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,089
it helps that AWS Bedrock has
the best selection of models,

523
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,870
the largest selection of
models of any cloud provider.

524
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,070
And we also leverage

525
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:37,320
some of the managed
solutions like for example,

526
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,923
AgentCore, SageMaker for our workflows.

527
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,260
But context matters as much

528
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,650
as the model quality as we talked earlier.

529
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,650
So MCP servers and hosts have
become our context backbone,

530
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,590
connecting AI tools

531
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,840
to up-to-date business
and technical content.

532
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,010
What has been key in
Prime Video is balancing

533
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,390
the central investments.

534
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,270
So for example, access to code repository

535
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,663
or issue tracking system
is funded centrally.

536
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,700
Whereas teams are building out

537
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,450
more specific knowledge
bases and MCP servers;

538
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,650
for example, access to all the
Prime Video catalog metadata

539
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,590
that is essential for
all the Prime Video teams

540
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,473
but are not necessarily
needed for other Amazon teams.

541
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,770
And at even more local level,

542
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,453
teams are building,

543
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,550
sharing prompts or steering files

544
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,930
to enable development

545
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,393
in the manner that you
saw James shared earlier.

546
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,460
And finally at the top is the experience

547
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,130
and tool layer where, again,

548
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,640
it's a mix of all the
shelf tools like Kiro

549
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,120
as well as customized agents
that I mentioned earlier

550
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,583
that teams build for their needs.

551
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,080
So you heard James share
his workflow re-imagination

552
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,003
with a development workflow.

553
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,650
I wanted to see if the same
infrastructure that we built

554
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,150
for enabling our development teams

555
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,150
can also help other roles
like product managers

556
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,073
and reinvent our workflows.

557
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,650
As part of our AI program,

558
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,360
I write a regular newsletter

559
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,240
with some of the new releases
both internally and externally

560
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,600
as well as fun success
stories that builders share.

561
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,620
And that process of searching
the external sources,

562
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,150
the internal Slack channels,

563
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,720
curating and editing the
manual tools used to take me

564
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,783
two to three hours to put
out good content out there.

565
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,990
I started leveraging AI

566
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,972
for some parts of the individual tasks,

567
00:26:56,972 --> 00:26:59,962
like searching the latest stories

568
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:04,350
related to AI and development tooling,

569
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,040
and eventually evolved
it into agentic workflow

570
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,520
where I can fetch data from
internal and external sources,

571
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,338
build agents that can pull things

572
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,330
from different Slack channels,

573
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,920
and curate them,

574
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,183
and then publish everything
using a Kiro template.

575
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,400
So now, this helped me change this process

576
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,463
down to about 30 minutes
of polish and review.

577
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,240
But this is just one PM workflow

578
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,920
and we are seeing the same transformation

579
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,996
across teams and roles.

580
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:41,996
So things like operational
review documents, data analysis.

581
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,567
We are seeing PMs, TPMs, sorry,

582
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:52,515
and managers, not just
developers really engage

583
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:57,363
with the agentic
capabilities that we have.

584
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,600
When every role starts
reimagining their workflows,

585
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,723
that when we see transformation happen.

586
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,820
And what we need for that

587
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,870
is for learning and experimentation

588
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,033
to become part of everyday culture.

589
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,133
So how did we enable that?

590
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,340
We leaned in into the AI
native learning flywheel

591
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,640
that James shared earlier.

592
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,830
Teams learned new techniques,

593
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,900
experimented with workflows,

594
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,910
shared results widely,

595
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,260
and it created curiosity
and healthy skepticism

596
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,653
that led to the next
wave of experimentation.

597
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,940
That loop and not a top-down mandate

598
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,913
was what drove adoption that lasts.

599
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,543
So how did we build that flywheel?

600
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,580
We started with safe sandboxes.

601
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,300
Demo days and hackathons
where teams were encouraged

602
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,150
to use AI to automate parts of the process

603
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,920
that weren't AI native yet,

604
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,340
maybe building test workflows

605
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,890
for different devices

606
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,343
or automating some of
the on-call operations.

607
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,410
And as that started gaining speed,

608
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,410
we've formalized some of the mechanisms.

609
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,270
So some of the early adopters

610
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,453
became our official AI champions.

611
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,330
Our principal engineering community

612
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,820
started an AI bar raising program.

613
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,760
At Amazon, we use the
concept of bar raising

614
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,560
for calibrating interviews

615
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,530
and for up leveling the quality of code

616
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,170
and follow ups after incidents.

617
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,473
And so we applied the same
concept to AI maturity.

618
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,540
Finally, we codified best practices

619
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,690
into a quick start guide for teams

620
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,590
who were ready to move
from AI-assisted workflows

621
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,003
more towards AI native.

622
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,480
And it wasn't just the recommended tools,

623
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,220
but importantly techniques.

624
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,760
For example, maintaining
live-in architecture specs

625
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,800
or the spec-driven development

626
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,500
that you saw demonstrated earlier.

627
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,160
We also embedded AI reflections

628
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,490
as part of rituals at all levels.

629
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,490
So be it a team retro or an
organizational quarterly review,

630
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,350
we have an AI learning section,

631
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,020
or time allocated where we share

632
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,870
both successes and challenges.

633
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,490
And that's what becomes-

634
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,783
that's what makes
experimentation truly normal.

635
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,120
But mechanisms alone weren't enough.

636
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,490
We also had to be intentional

637
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,670
about who we reached

638
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,170
and what they needed to learn.

639
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,630
If you accelerate only
one part of the process

640
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,890
of one role and one team,

641
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,070
then you're just moving the
bottleneck somewhere else.

642
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,340
So if our development team became twice

643
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,260
as efficient and fast,

644
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,120
but decisions and requirements

645
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,270
were still following the old processes,

646
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,580
then the overall, we
were not really getting

647
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,533
more efficient as an organization.

648
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,530
So we needed to design a
learning path for every role

649
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,130
and not just teach them new
tools and prompting techniques,

650
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,640
but also the new ways of
working and collaborating

651
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,263
with each other and with AI.

652
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,333
So for engineering,

653
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,620
we've ran workshops on
spec-driven development,

654
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,350
technique that James shared earlier.

655
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,960
And then, we've also had training

656
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,753
on agent workflow creation.

657
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,100
For product managers and designers,

658
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,080
we were already leaning
and heavily onto AI

659
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,610
for writing and creating
prototypes, sorry,

660
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,200
and creating specs.

661
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,368
But with learning how
to use coding techniques

662
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:06,680
or white coding techniques;

663
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,640
in that case for PMs, it was okay,

664
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,390
we started doing prototypes as well.

665
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,942
Just recently, I ran a workshop

666
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:16,120
for about 50 product managers

667
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,090
and many of them coded for the first time.

668
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,640
And it was truly transformative
for them to realize

669
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,310
how much more power they had

670
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,396
to explore some of the
ideas and interactions

671
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:30,963
that they had with AI tools.

672
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,030
Our data teams have created interfaces

673
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,498
for natural language
queries from their data

674
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,894
so that they didn't have to be bogged down

675
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:43,832
in creating simple queries

676
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:46,653
and instead focusing on
more complex problems.

677
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,590
And we even trained our
leadership to use MCP

678
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,370
to do things like
streamline goal reporting

679
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,090
or querying strategic
document knowledge bases.

680
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,750
Speaking of MCP, model context protocol,

681
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,613
you'll notice that that's
highlighted in every quadrant.

682
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,410
So every role had to learn

683
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,820
how to use access and use
relevant knowledge bases and tools

684
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,203
via model context protocol.

685
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:22,140
And as people adopted new tools

686
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,840
and experimented more and shared,

687
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,690
we realized that in some cases,

688
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,590
we were moving faster than our processes

689
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,663
and guidelines were ready for.

690
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,993
So that's where trust and rigor comes in.

691
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,432
And I wanna start with
sharing a couple stories

692
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:43,470
from like early pitfalls

693
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,920
on our way to AI native transformation.

694
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,593
First was the code review overload.

695
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,503
As AI got good enough to
generate multi-file changes,

696
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,347
we found ourselves in a
situation where tech leads

697
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:02,310
and senior engineers were bogged down

698
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,743
by a large volume of large code reviews.

699
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,590
So even though the code
generation accelerated,

700
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,890
what we found is that this created

701
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,290
a bottleneck in the code reviews.

702
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,830
And to address that, we did a few things.

703
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,850
We leaned in

704
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,600
into the Amazon leadership
principle of ownership.

705
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,400
And as James was describing earlier,

706
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,390
it's not web coding,

707
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,120
it's really important to truly review

708
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,523
every line that you produce, of course.

709
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,725
And then, we've also built
some code review agents

710
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:39,330
that we incorporated into the workflow.

711
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,840
There's always a human
review that's required.

712
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,220
But in some cases,

713
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,250
we realized that we can
leverage agentic code review

714
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,320
for some part of the process.

715
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,940
And so with those changes in place,

716
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,553
the code review velocity
started flowing again.

717
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,813
Second was policy and process friction.

718
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,900
As teams started building more agents

719
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,190
and automating workflow,

720
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,940
sometimes fully autonomously
without even human in the loop,

721
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,653
agents needed access to data.

722
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,610
But our review processes were built

723
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,930
for human approvals,

724
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,733
not agentic approvals.

725
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,410
And so the innovation was slowed down

726
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,043
by this friction.

727
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,818
What we did was partnered
with our security privacy

728
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,290
and other stakeholders

729
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,970
to modernize some of the processes

730
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,553
and even automate some
of the governance steps.

731
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,910
Having learned from
these lessons early on,

732
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:43,080
we realized that rigor and
mechanisms for governance

733
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,873
need to be built in at
every layer of our system.

734
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,680
So you'll remember the AI enablement stack

735
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,250
that I shared a little while ago.

736
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,870
And so at each layer,

737
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,453
we've built in the right
guardrails and controls.

738
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,038
At our infrastructure,

739
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:03,510
we had to build in things
like capacity controls

740
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,603
because, of course, AI usage

741
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:08,373
can spread so quickly
without realizing it.

742
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,810
We've also, of course,
enabled IAM policies

743
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,550
and other mechanisms

744
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,320
that we would use for
any production workload.

745
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,153
And so we applied it

746
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:19,323
for our developer tooling
and infrastructure.

747
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,220
At the modeling and capability layer,

748
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,316
we've created prompt
templates, fallback mechanisms,

749
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:29,286
and rigorous evaluation sets

750
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:31,770
so that every time a new model came out

751
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,790
or something else changed,

752
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,600
we could quickly move on and adopt it

753
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,073
and have confidence.

754
00:36:40,277 --> 00:36:41,819
At the context layer,

755
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,750
that was probably one of the
more challenging ones to crack.

756
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,410
But like enabling the right set

757
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,013
of authentication controls

758
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:56,160
for remote and local MCP servers

759
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,970
and codifying the right
approach organization-wide

760
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,454
has really helped us unlock

761
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:03,513
safe experimentation there.

762
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,360
And finally, at the experience layer,

763
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,910
Kiro and workflow-specific agents

764
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,560
enforce the right permissions

765
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,090
based on a combination

766
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,170
of single sign-on
authentication within Amazon

767
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,483
as well as the
service-to-service authentication

768
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:24,003
that we use for agents.

769
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,060
So with this controls in place,

770
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,595
builders didn't have to
worry about compliance

771
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:33,717
or be as tentative or uncertain
about what they can use

772
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:35,520
and what they couldn't

773
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,273
and the safe path became
the easy path to take.

774
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,190
So those were the three pillars:

775
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,380
access and infrastructure,

776
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,493
culture and learning,

777
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,653
and trust and rigor.

778
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,953
The natural question is,
did it actually work?

779
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,570
While I can't share the exact numbers,

780
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,710
I wanna be transparent about
how we measured the impact

781
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,260
because you can't transform
what you can't measure.

782
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,413
Early on, we were focusing on AI adoption.

783
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:15,780
And probably the whole first year,

784
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,180
we were obsessed over that number,

785
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,700
but eventually it got
saturated, of course,

786
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,650
as everyone was using AI for
those kind of isolated tasks.

787
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,050
So we started focusing
in our adoption metrics

788
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,250
on more tool-specific to
different phases, OSDLC,

789
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,750
adoption per roles.

790
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,220
So we still monitor it very closely,

791
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,843
but it's not just pure adoption.

792
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,490
And in terms of velocity
and efficiency outcomes,

793
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,972
we use DORA metrics,

794
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:50,114
the industry standard
metrics for velocity.

795
00:38:50,114 --> 00:38:54,330
And so we've been seeing
meaningful increases

796
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,850
in our deployment velocity

797
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,650
as well as code review velocity.

798
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,782
But of course, it's really
important to control

799
00:39:01,782 --> 00:39:04,934
for incident rates and rollback rates.

800
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:06,900
So this is something that we always

801
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,153
have to keep hand-in-hand
attention metrics.

802
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,890
But beyond those
organizational-wide adoption

803
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,840
and velocity metrics,

804
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,455
we've also dove in deeper
into specific areas

805
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:22,710
that we were trying to
change with those agents

806
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,620
that we built for specific use cases.

807
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,930
And so that's where we track things

808
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,600
like efficiency gains and time gains

809
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,623
and other metrics that
are best for the use case.

810
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,610
Finally, probably the
best source of insight

811
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,230
is really listening to our builders.

812
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,389
So regular surveys, interviews,

813
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:50,070
and importantly leadership
listening sessions

814
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,560
have been a good source for us to learn

815
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:57,480
where we can make changes
and what's working well

816
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,253
and what needs an improvement.

817
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,240
Here are a couple of quotes

818
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,900
from our recent engineering
round of interviews.

819
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,126
I'm particularly excited about the top one

820
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:14,850
where this engineer used to spend

821
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,290
three weeks at a minimum

822
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,530
on something that wasn't even coding.

823
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,570
So it was not the part of her job

824
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,250
that she was most excited about,

825
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,750
but it was about designing,

826
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,610
writing down the design documentation,

827
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,750
iterating with the team,

828
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,870
aligning with different stakeholders.

829
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,776
And so with AI tooling,

830
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:38,670
the writing of the document

831
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,130
has become done another three days.

832
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,209
And then, she really could focus her time

833
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:46,863
on discussing with stakeholders
for integration use cases.

834
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,190
And with that, it's back to James

835
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,780
for an exciting demo.

836
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,390
- All right, I think I'm
contractually obligated

837
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,012
to give a demo if it's
an AI talk, I don't know.

838
00:41:00,012 --> 00:41:02,679
Great, so thanks so much for
taking us through all of that.

839
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:05,970
Again, it's so important, like
grassroots energy is great,

840
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,939
but then that structure
of organizationally

841
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:10,500
is how you really make it scale.

842
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,810
Now that story I told you earlier

843
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,910
where I was saying don't
worry about copying prompts,

844
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,350
we have something better.

845
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,820
That story was from way back

846
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,010
like early March timeframe or so,

847
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,350
and it was a story that
I shared internally

848
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,864
and it sparked a lot of excitement

849
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:25,334
and I got a lot of feedback

850
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,454
that many people found it very inspiring.

851
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:30,264
And so I thought it was
important to share that story

852
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:32,280
with you all as well.

853
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,800
That said, March was a long time ago,

854
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,504
especially in AI time.

855
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:38,269
It was a very long time ago

856
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:40,950
and we've come a long way since.

857
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,900
There, I'd posted an internal blog

858
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,400
with that whole breakdown

859
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,600
and there were people like copying

860
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,280
and pasting these prompts.

861
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,620
Well, we've found a much
better way to do this

862
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,590
and we just opened-sourced
it less than two weeks ago,

863
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,871
and it's called Strands Agent SOPs.

864
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:58,341
And rather than read a blog post to you,

865
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,123
I'm just gonna show 'em to you.

866
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,583
Let me log in here.

867
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,960
All right, so this is...

868
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,380
give it a minute, there we go.

869
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,064
This is the github repository.

870
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:18,413
SOP stands for standard
operating procedure.

871
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,000
What is a standard operating procedure?

872
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,650
Well, it's a document with a set

873
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,458
of detailed step-by-step instructions

874
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,210
that help usually a person

875
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,090
to do some routine task or process.

876
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,280
In this case, these are agent SOPs

877
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,460
and they help repeatedly,

878
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,013
repeatedly follow a
set of steps and tasks.

879
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,943
So I have kiro-cli pulled up here.

880
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,060
I'm actually in the codebase

881
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,543
of the Strands Agent SOP,

882
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,593
and I'm going to run this.

883
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:55,800
If we look at our prompts,

884
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,660
we have a strands-agent-sop
MCP server that we vend.

885
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,130
And do you remember back when I said,

886
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,770
what is this codebase
and explore my codebase?

887
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,920
Well, now I have a
agent-sop that I can run

888
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,370
that generates this prompt.

889
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,810
And now the agent says, great,

890
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,970
I'll help you run this
codebase-summary SOP.

891
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,975
There's some parameters
required codebase_path.

892
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:23,490
Otherwise, I'll default
to your current directory.

893
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,230
Well, that is what I want.

894
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,580
In this case, I'm going to tell it

895
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,650
to go ahead and consolidate.

896
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,570
So it'll generate a number of documents,

897
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,270
but I want to create a
consolidated AGENTS.md,

898
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,763
which is the default,

899
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,160
and that's all it needs.

900
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,570
So now it starts running this
standard operating procedure.

901
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,523
It starts reading through the codebase.

902
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:49,140
Now I wanna show you what
this actually looks like.

903
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,350
So a standard operating-

904
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,990
agent-sop is just a Markdown file,

905
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,850
but it's a very specific format.

906
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,810
It has a title.

907
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,150
It has an overview saying what it does.

908
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,650
It has this parameter section

909
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,360
that talks about different parameters

910
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,430
that this SOP can take.

911
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,530
And then, it has a list of steps.

912
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,530
You can see step one is set
up and directory structure,

913
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,051
initialize the analysis environment

914
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:14,970
and create necessary directory structure.

915
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,040
Now if I just stop there,

916
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,170
the agent might do different things

917
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,330
every time that you run it.

918
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:24,120
The magic happens with
this constraint section.

919
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,530
There's a constraint section

920
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,830
that includes these
RFC 2119 style keywords

921
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,840
like must all and caps or should

922
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,660
or should not or must not or may.

923
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,820
And this adds constraints

924
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,790
around how it should execute this step.

925
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,530
So in this case, you must validate

926
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,440
codebase_path exists.

927
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,350
Or in this case, analyzing
the codebase structure,

928
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,880
you must use Mermaid diagrams

929
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,593
for all visual representations.

930
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:52,459
It seems really simple,

931
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,837
but with this structure,

932
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:57,540
also with these steps,

933
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,373
you end up-

934
00:44:58,373 --> 00:45:00,210
we also have an example section

935
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,600
because LLMs work very well with examples.

936
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,370
And then, there's a
troubleshooting section as well

937
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,143
that helps it with troubleshooting.

938
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,340
This format, we have found internally

939
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,920
the agents respond incredibly well,

940
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,220
like our results with just
kind of free form prompting

941
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,297
versus free form prompting

942
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:26,160
versus following these constraints.

943
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,160
The agent, we internally
lovingly call deterministic

944
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:35,280
that their behavior is kind of it strikes

945
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,560
the perfect balance between you want it

946
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,490
to follow the same procedure every time,

947
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,490
but you wanna leverage
the flexibility of agents.

948
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,170
And what we can see

949
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,660
is that this summary has been
running in the background

950
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,620
or this codebase summary

951
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,640
has been running in the background

952
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,620
and is generating these files.

953
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,674
So it generates this
codebase information file

954
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:58,830
that talks about the technology stack,

955
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,998
has the directory structure, right?

956
00:46:01,998 --> 00:46:05,130
And programming languages used.

957
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,280
It talks about the architecture
that found in the codebase

958
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,690
and it uses Mermaid diagrams,

959
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,713
which is a very concise text-based format

960
00:46:12,713 --> 00:46:14,973
that Markdown can render.

961
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,683
And it just generated
a new one, components.

962
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,620
And it's going to continue
following that SOP.

963
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,880
And every time you run this,

964
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,160
it's going to generate
the same set of documents

965
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,600
with the same sections in it.

966
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,210
Sometimes, the text is a
little bit different each time,

967
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,160
but it's the same critical information

968
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,010
because it's following this
standard operating procedure.

969
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,270
Now you may have been
looking at this saying,

970
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,260
okay, this is great,

971
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,803
but this seems like a big
pain to write this document.

972
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,860
This is very long.

973
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,093
There's a lot to it.

974
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,230
And SOPs would be a pain to write

975
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,910
if you had to write 'em by hand,

976
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,410
but you don't have to.

977
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,160
So the SOP program

978
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,140
that we vended open-source,

979
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,150
it offers MCP server.

980
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,390
It also comes with this rule embedded.

981
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,450
So you can say rule

982
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,440
and it outputs this rule

983
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,318
that you can use with whatever
agentic system you use.

984
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:26,610
In this case, I'm using Kiro

985
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,430
and so I import it as a steering file.

986
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,560
You don't have to worry
about reading this format.

987
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,560
This is just something that tells the LLM

988
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,150
that exact format.

989
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,130
And with this as a steering file,

990
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,940
I can then author these very easily.

991
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,551
So in this case,

992
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,240
I'm going to use this context feature

993
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,013
to add my steering file.

994
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,210
Okay, so you can see now this
agent-sop-format is there.

995
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,340
And just as an example,

996
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,630
I'm in another folder right now.

997
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,200
I'm going to say: Create
an agent sop that,

998
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,003
given a person's name,

999
00:48:12,026 --> 00:48:16,830
outputs a short, fun poem

1000
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,743
incorporating their name.

1001
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,117
So all I have to do is chat with it.

1002
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:30,240
And then, it's going to create this SOP.

1003
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,230
It knows the format

1004
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,180
because I put that into
its steering files.

1005
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,030
And there you go.

1006
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,910
So now we have this SOP

1007
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,160
that's called Name Poem Generator.

1008
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,890
And you can see it follows that format.

1009
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,353
And since I have the MCP server loaded,

1010
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,073
I'm gonna go ahead

1011
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,720
and reload kiro-cli

1012
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,503
and I should see my Name Poem SOP pop up.

1013
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,180
So if I run the prompts command,

1014
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,713
there's now this name poem.

1015
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,403
I can run it.

1016
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,540
Says, okay, it needs to know my name.

1017
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,833
So I put in my name.

1018
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,410
And then, it wants to confirm
the spelling of my name.

1019
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,553
Yay, LLMs.

1020
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,477
Okay, so generated some poem.

1021
00:49:30,477 --> 00:49:31,983
But I can also-

1022
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,653
so I can say:

1023
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,713
add an optional hometown parameter.

1024
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,790
Okay, so now it's updating this agent-sop

1025
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,773
to add this hometown parameter.

1026
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,803
Okay, so now I'm going to run this again.

1027
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,660
Another thing about agent-sops

1028
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,450
is if you know the
parameters ahead of time,

1029
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,103
first off, this-

1030
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,390
so you notice this parameter
is called person_name

1031
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,150
and this is called hometown.

1032
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,907
Well, if I run this name-poem

1033
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:28,680
and I pass it some arguments,

1034
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,820
I don't, I can-

1035
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,380
it's an LLM that's interpreting this.

1036
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,250
So I can just say:

1037
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,903
My name is James and I
am from Tucson, Arizona.

1038
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,720
And it'll parse the
parameters out of that.

1039
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,060
And look, there's my poem.

1040
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,390
Now it's desert-themed
because I'm from Arizona.

1041
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:53,390
Okay, so cute, cute demo but this is-

1042
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,720
we want something more real world, right?

1043
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:57,960
And we just wanted to show you

1044
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,300
what the agent SOP format looks like.

1045
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,300
However, note that I have
the github MCP server loaded

1046
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,339
and I have access

1047
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,250
to these different github
tools that it provides.

1048
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:16,250
And so how about I say create an agent sop

1049
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,570
that triages github issues given

1050
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,603
a repo URL.

1051
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,170
Little more real world.

1052
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,633
Anyone have a github repo? Yeah?

1053
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,870
I mean I love poems, but...

1054
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,070
All right, so there's my SOP.

1055
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,530
Let's go ahead and take
a quick look at it.

1056
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,920
So it creates an SOP, takes the repo URL,

1057
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,350
it grabs the repository info.

1058
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,000
Fetch open issues,

1059
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,550
says all open issues from the repository.

1060
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,993
Analyze each issue.

1061
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,190
And then, generate triage report.

1062
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,320
And it says to save it to this file.

1063
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,880
And then, present findings.

1064
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,203
So I'm gonna say, update this:

1065
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:22,833
Search for unlabeled issues.

1066
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:28,350
Triaging means applying relevant labels

1067
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,860
and adding an issue comment,

1068
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,600
or a triage comment to the issue.

1069
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,600
And don't write the report to a file,

1070
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,583
just output it.

1071
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,360
And add a dry run flag

1072
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,150
that won't actually

1073
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,740
make the updates

1074
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,533
but reports what would've happened.

1075
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,353
For demo purposes.

1076
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,540
So I'm just able to
converse with this agent

1077
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,060
and you can see it added the dry run flag.

1078
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,123
It updates the SOP with
what triaging means.

1079
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,750
And then, you can see it's
modifying these constraints

1080
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,863
under the covers.

1081
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,430
Now because I have the github repo,

1082
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,042
or excuse me, because I
have the github MCP server,

1083
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:28,170
you'll notice that some
of these constraints

1084
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,060
actually name tools.

1085
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,160
And that's because MCP puts all the tools

1086
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,780
in context of the agent.

1087
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,920
So when you're authoring this,

1088
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,980
you wanna make sure you have
the MCP servers available

1089
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,510
that it may need to use

1090
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,470
and that'll help it create

1091
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,853
a more effective agent SOP.

1092
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,803
All right, so now I'm gonna run it.

1093
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,630
Okay, it's made the updates.

1094
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:02,130
I'm actually gonna run it on
the strands-agent-sop repo.

1095
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,300
It's relatively a new repo,

1096
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,923
so not too many issues.

1097
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,660
And now what you'll see under /prompts

1098
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,423
is I have this github-issue-triage.

1099
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,563
Okay, it says great,
give me your repo_url.

1100
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:26,370
And then, the dry_run flag's optional

1101
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,830
and it defaults to false

1102
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,543
but I'm gonna set it to true.

1103
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,780
Okay, so now it's
triaging unlabeled issues.

1104
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,560
So it's calling the github MCP
server's search_issues tool.

1105
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,713
And you can see that it's
applying the no:label feature.

1106
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,490
It's in dry run mode.

1107
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,120
It outputted that here

1108
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,000
and it called out a couple issues.

1109
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,950
It said, okay, here's
a high-priority issue.

1110
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,780
This is labels to apply:

1111
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,450
enhancement, feature-request, mcp.

1112
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,320
Comment to add,

1113
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,480
and this is the comment
it was going to add.

1114
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,366
And then medium priority,

1115
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:07,143
these other two issues,

1116
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,580
and it calls out labels
that it's going to add.

1117
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,170
Now, if I didn't run this in dry run mode,

1118
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,680
it would actually make
those updates to the issue.

1119
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,540
I could also go back and forth with it

1120
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,558
if I don't like how that's, you know,

1121
00:55:20,558 --> 00:55:21,990
don't like this comment

1122
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,580
or want it to use a different style.

1123
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,340
I can just go back and
forth with the chat.

1124
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,523
Now this issue #22 is kind
of standing out to me.

1125
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,083
How about we actually implement it?

1126
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,530
So again, I'm in the agent-sop repo.

1127
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,660
I just used my codebase-summary

1128
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,120
that generated this super nice AGENTS.md

1129
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,250
based off of scanning the entire codebase,

1130
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,050
and now there's this AGENTS.md

1131
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,210
that gets my agent up to
speed with this codebase

1132
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,953
and understanding this codebase.

1133
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,570
And now I'm gonna run
this thing called pdd.

1134
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,070
This was prompt-driven development,

1135
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,630
which was an internal predecessor

1136
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,463
to Kiro's spec-driven development.

1137
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:19,920
And this is that issue
that I was looking at.

1138
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,720
Issue 22, I didn't create this.

1139
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,838
This is not my user.

1140
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,083
This is an actual feature.

1141
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:37,893
Oh, a little bit of latency going on.

1142
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,080
All right, let's try this again.

1143
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,080
Okay, so this is an agent-sop

1144
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,880
that takes you through that entire process

1145
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,920
that I walked you through earlier.

1146
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,570
So this asks for my rough idea.

1147
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:56,070
So I can say rough_idea is
this link to this issue.

1148
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,710
And then as this project directory,

1149
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,693
this sop/planning.

1150
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,390
So I just gave it this rough_idea.

1151
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,293
Uh-oh, yay, for live demos.

1152
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,060
Let's see, if I get this
again, I might have to restart.

1153
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,960
Oh, okay, great.

1154
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,373
So now it read my issue.

1155
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,683
Okay, so now it knows,

1156
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,620
it starts doing some setup.

1157
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,873
It creates this directory structure.

1158
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:33,540
So it creates this planning folder

1159
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,783
that has design,
implementation, and research.

1160
00:57:38,112 --> 00:57:42,510
It took that issue and it
copied it into this rough idea.

1161
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,010
And then it starts asking,

1162
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,840
do you want to do
requirements clarification?

1163
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,569
Do you want to do some
preliminary research first?

1164
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:51,360
Any additional context
you want to provide?

1165
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,790
It also tells me to run this command.

1166
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,615
That way, it pins anything,

1167
00:57:55,615 --> 00:57:59,220
any documents that are created
as part of this process.

1168
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,283
So I can say, sure,
requirements clarification.

1169
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,553
So we'll start there.

1170
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,015
And again, I didn't have to share some,

1171
00:58:09,015 --> 00:58:10,928
like copy paste some prompts,

1172
00:58:10,928 --> 00:58:14,400
this is something that you
can download and you can use.

1173
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,890
So it starts writing
this idea-honing file.

1174
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,330
And it says, okay, question one,

1175
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,650
what's the scope of the tool?

1176
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,150
This feature request was asking

1177
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,240
for MCP tools in our MCP server.

1178
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,940
So it says, this issue
mentions adding list-sops,

1179
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,285
use-sop tools to the MCP server.

1180
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:32,070
Should these tools:

1181
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,160
A, Replace the current
prompt-based approach entirely;

1182
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,285
or complement the existing prompts;

1183
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:39,585
or be configurable.

1184
00:58:39,585 --> 00:58:41,580
I want both of them.

1185
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,540
And then it'll continue.

1186
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,980
It'll just ask me questions.

1187
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,560
And then once we get to
logical stopping point,

1188
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,995
I can tell it to move ahead to design.

1189
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:51,036
I can tell it to go to
an implementation plan

1190
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:53,550
and I would absolutely do that for you.

1191
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,533
But we are out of time.

1192
00:58:58,855 --> 00:59:00,570
- [Audience 1] Quick
question, if you don't mind?

1193
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,700
- Just a second.

1194
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,900
But if you're interested in seeing me

1195
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,570
implement that entire feature,

1196
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,240
you should come to our code talk

1197
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,160
or you should come to my
code talk later today,

1198
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,360
which is happening,

1199
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,636
which is talking about how Amazon teams

1200
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:17,700
use AI assistance to
accelerate development.

1201
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,542
And it's ambitious,

1202
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:21,680
but I'm gonna try to implement
the whole feature on stage.

1203
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,480
So it'll be exciting either way.

1204
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,071
Come see that this afternoon.

1205
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:30,375
We also have a session being given

1206
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:33,690
by Eva Knight and Bethany Otto,

1207
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,760
and they have done a lot of work

1208
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,689
on kind of how they
measure the impact of AI

1209
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:40,290
across the company.

1210
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:42,595
So that's another good one to catch.

1211
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:46,620
We also have a QR code for
the agent-sop github repo.

1212
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,970
So you can download it,

1213
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:49,440
you can try it for yourself,

1214
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,940
you can give us a star,

1215
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,995
it would be fantastic.

1216
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:55,860
But with that, we're at time.

1217
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,565
Really appreciate your time
today and thanks so much.

1218
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:01,732
(audience applauding)
