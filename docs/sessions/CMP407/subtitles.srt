1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,763
- Good morning and welcome to re:Invent.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,310
Every one of you here has
followed the advice I received

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,040
when I told my friends
I was going to Vegas.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,620
You made good choices.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,623
Choices which have led you
here to this session today.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,770
At an event like re:Invent,

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,830
you have a variety of interesting
options to choose from,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,810
but you decided to be here.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,740
And for that we are very, very grateful.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,240
My name is Arvind

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,850
and I will be jointly
presenting this session

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,843
with William Yap, Principal
Product Manager at AWS.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,560
Let me first set the stage and tell you

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,090
what we're gonna talk about.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,500
We're gonna kick this off by
discussing why we are here.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,650
We'll share what
confidential computing means.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,940
What are some of the workloads

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,280
that require confidential computing.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,730
And what are the requirements
of these workloads.

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,300
We'll then proceed to
share AWS's perspective

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,870
on confidential computing

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,500
and what we have done to make
sure confidential computing

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,653
is always on for our customers.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,190
We will then proceed to talk about

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,820
additional requirements
like enhanced isolation

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,190
and the workloads that can take advantage

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,253
of capabilities like AWS Nitro Enclaves.

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,480
And with that in the true spirit of Vegas,

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,690
you will learn that what
happens in an enclave

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,565
stays in an enclave.

31
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:37,620
(audience laughing)

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,480
We will then switch gears

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,140
and talk a little bit about AI workloads

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,350
and the requirements that have
come with these new workloads

35
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,873
and what we have done to respond to that.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,940
William will then take you through

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,310
and talk about our new
capability, EC2 attestation.

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,570
We launched it earlier this year,

39
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,950
we are very excited about it,

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,073
this brand new stuff we're
gonna be talking to you about.

41
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,620
And then he'll tell
you how we have brought

42
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,253
enclave-like capabilities
to EC2 instances.

43
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,660
And then he'll dive
deeper into attestation,

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,550
tell you how to take
advantage of attestation,

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,450
how to use it,

46
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,000
demystify the approach for you.

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,880
And then we'll walk you
through some use cases

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,380
like confidential inferencing,

49
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,870
federated learning, and some others.

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,790
And then we'll close this session out

51
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,580
with some resources for
you to take advantage of

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,700
so you can start building
when you leave this room.

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,320
Sound good to you?

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,140
All right, let's get to it.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,880
So why are we here?

56
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,880
We are here today because you
and I share a common goal.

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,580
We care about building solutions

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,623
that enable data protection.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,110
But let's first talk about data

60
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,113
because just like us, not
all data is created equal.

61
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,050
I'm just more handsome than some people.

62
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,523
That's just it, right?

63
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,270
There's innocuous data and
there is sensitive data.

64
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,603
When we are talking about data protection,

65
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:15,993
we are talking about data
that needs to be protected,

66
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,213
sensitive data.

67
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,950
Now if you look at data and
you look at what we do with it,

68
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,080
everything we do with data

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,200
can be bucketed under three operations,

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,610
storing data, moving
data and processing data.

71
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,223
Everything we do can fall
under one of these three.

72
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,820
And data is constantly in that flux.

73
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,350
It just keeps moving from data at rest

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,213
to data in transit and data in use.

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,990
The mechanisms to protect data

76
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,730
while the data is at rest and
in transit are fairly mature.

77
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,670
They existed for a long
time, very well-documented.

78
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,320
People know how to use it

79
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,790
and many of you probably
use it already, I hope.

80
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,700
So what we're gonna focus on today

81
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,733
is protecting data in use.

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,550
Confidential computing is
the ability to protect data

83
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,230
while the data is in use,

84
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,020
while the data is being processed.

85
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,020
And that's what we are
gonna be talking about today

86
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,477
and that's why we are here.

87
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:27,420
We are here to learn
how to build solutions

88
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,640
that'll enable you to protect data

89
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,463
while the data is being
processed in memory.

90
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,500
On the screen you see a
smattering of some workloads

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,330
that require confidential computing.

92
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,673
It's just a few examples,
there's a lot more.

93
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,060
Decryption as an operation, right?

94
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,230
It could be decrypting,
data revealing plain text.

95
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,170
You may wanna protect it
if it's sensitive data.

96
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,870
Signing transactions, could
be financial transactions,

97
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,070
could be something else.

98
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,120
Signing is a very, very
popular workload and use case.

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,710
Tokenization.

100
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,360
Tokenization could mean many things,

101
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,300
many different things
depending on the industry,

102
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,190
on the vertical you're focused on.

103
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,613
It could be tokenizing personally
identifiable information.

104
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,083
It could be tokenizing financial
assets, digital assets.

105
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,210
The tokenization is a
workload that is begging

106
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,003
for protection of the
data that is tokenizing.

107
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,883
Masking.

108
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,020
Masking is another very popular use case.

109
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,790
Masking credit card information,

110
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,460
masking your name, your
social security number,

111
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,930
whatever it may be.

112
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,510
But you can see there's a
common theme with all of this.

113
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,950
It's the data types.

114
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,890
It's either personally
identifiable information

115
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,700
or protected healthcare
information, financial assets,

116
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,490
digital assets, sensitive IP models

117
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
could be a whole bunch of things.

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,490
And all of these different workloads

119
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,760
come with a common set of requirements.

120
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,130
Customers wanna make sure

121
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,730
that there is no unauthorized
access to any of this data

122
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,750
and they also wanna make sure
that only authorized code,

123
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,930
code that's already been
approved and authenticated

124
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,350
is the only one that has the
ability to process this data

125
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,630
while keeping their
tax surface really low.

126
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,250
Because we are processing sensitive data,

127
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,293
we wanna contain it as much as we can.

128
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,600
And some workloads here are
more CPU-heavy, compute-heavy

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,390
and certain other workloads
are more maybe memory-heavy

130
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,350
depending on the workload.

131
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,770
So customers want flexibility
with resources as well.

132
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,020
And all of these set of requirements

133
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,600
need to get fulfilled while making sure

134
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,183
we are keeping things easy to use.

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
So these are some common
set of requirements

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,700
that we have had to deal with when we work

137
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,490
with confidential computing workloads.

138
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,650
So when I talk to customers,

139
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,833
it often comes down to two considerations.

140
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,700
What are you looking to protect

141
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,863
and who are you looking
to protect it from?

142
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,010
The answer to what
you're looking to protect

143
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,450
has already been established, right?

144
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,400
I think we all agreed,

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,140
we're looking to protect sensitive data.

146
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,630
So when you're building
specialized capabilities

147
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,820
to protect data, it better be the case

148
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,020
it is for sensitive data,

149
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,630
otherwise it may not be worth the effort.

150
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,003
So we know we're talking about
protecting sensitive data.

151
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:28,563
It's a straightforward answer.

152
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,570
When you get into the question

153
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,730
of who you are looking to protect it from,

154
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,893
the answer is oftentimes twofold.

155
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,553
Depending on the workload
and the customer,

156
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,160
they're at first looking
to protect their content

157
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,553
from operators of the cloud
provider, AWS operators.

158
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,000
And depending on the
workload and data types,

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,930
sometimes in addition to
protection from AWS operators,

160
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,990
customers want to make
sure they're protecting

161
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,870
that data even from themselves,

162
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,603
from customers' own operators.

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,940
To summarize everything I just said,

164
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,683
if you weren't fully following it,

165
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,330
confidential computing is
the ability to protect data

166
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,310
while the data is in use

167
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,070
and customers want to protect that data

168
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,830
from us and from themselves.

169
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,920
That's it, that's the summary
of everything I just said,

170
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,393
protecting data and use.

171
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,110
So now let's get into looking at

172
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,500
how AWS addresses these considerations.

173
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,890
How are we making sure we
are protecting the data

174
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,540
from AWS operators?

175
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,010
Let's start with that

176
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,810
and then I'll segue into how to protect it

177
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,010
from yourselves as well.

178
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,940
To understand how we have operationalized

179
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,750
protecting customer
content from AWS operators,

180
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,150
we'll have to step back and understand

181
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,373
how we reimagined virtualization.

182
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,440
On the screen here you
see a representation

183
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,220
of what I would like to
call classic virtualization.

184
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,640
This is still how
virtualization looks like

185
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,520
in most hyperscalers,
in most implementations,

186
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,143
and it works fairly well.

187
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,660
If you look at the picture,
you have these small

188
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,370
white boxes at the top.

189
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,190
They're all customer
instances, they're your VMs.

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,650
Then you have these colored
boxes at the bottom.

191
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,590
Let's just say they're all
virtualization functions

192
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,030
that need to happen

193
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,730
to enable the whole virtualization stack.

194
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,060
And between these, you have
a full blown hypervisor.

195
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,860
The Xen hypervisor, which orchestrates

196
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,650
all of these functions,
ring fences the VMs,

197
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,290
allocates the resources and everything.

198
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,320
So now the host, in addition
to providing the VMs,

199
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,590
has to contend with having to take care

200
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,140
of networking and IO functions,

201
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,003
storage and device models,

202
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,510
and other operational functions

203
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,963
like management, security,
monitoring, all of that.

204
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,000
So you can quickly see, in
addition to providing the VMs,

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,230
there's a lot of resources

206
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,510
that's getting spent on taking care

207
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,420
of operationalizing these
virtualization functions,

208
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,973
which is all then being
orchestrated by hypervisor.

209
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,900
So when we set out on our
journey to reimagine this,

210
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,400
we challenged the status quo.

211
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,370
It's working well, but can
we do it better, right?

212
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,580
Because we wanted to utilize
the resources on the host

213
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,973
better than we were so we
can provide more VMs to you.

214
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,780
So what we did in that process

215
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,330
was start looking at how can we abstract

216
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,930
these virtualization
functions away from the host.

217
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,820
So we free up more resources from the host

218
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,933
to basically offer more VMs.

219
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,560
So we took each of the functions

220
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,210
that you're seeing at the bottom,

221
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,320
starting with networking and IO functions,

222
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,630
and ran it on custom silicon.

223
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,270
We hardened it and we
ran it on custom silicon

224
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,550
and we abstracted it away from the host

225
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,700
and it went into a
separate box of its own.

226
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,590
We did that first with networking and IO

227
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,976
and we were pretty successful with it.

228
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:10,809
And we said, okay,

229
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,140
let's go and start
removing piece by piece.

230
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,080
And then we removed
storage and device models.

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,740
And finally we came the
to operational functions,

232
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,110
monitoring, management,
security and all that

233
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,160
and removed it.

234
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,970
Each of these was hardened in
its own separate PCIE card.

235
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,773
We call them Nitro cards.

236
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,060
And we have a series of
Nitro cards, which we,

237
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,100
you know, from a mental model perspective,

238
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,350
which we have in a
separate box, if you will,

239
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,860
which implement all of these functions

240
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,990
in tandem with the host.

241
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,403
So we ended up with a
system that looks like this.

242
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,000
By abstracting all of the
virtualization functions away,

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,933
we were able to remove
ourselves also from the host.

244
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,160
Now you can quickly see if the
host is just left with VMs,

245
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,050
it doesn't need a full blown hypervisor

246
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,580
like the Xen hypervisor.

247
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,150
So we wrote our own, a very
thin, lightweight hypervisor

248
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,550
called the Nitro hypervisor,

249
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,730
which has very little to do actually.

250
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,350
It just has to ring fence the VMs,

251
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,300
take care of some IO functions,

252
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,420
allocate the right CPU
and memory resources.

253
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,370
It doesn't have to do
all of the orchestration

254
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,870
that the Xen hypervisor had to do.

255
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,303
So it's very lightweight,
very little overhead.

256
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,870
So when we developed
and deployed the system,

257
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,860
in addition to utilizing the
resources of the host better,

258
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,630
we also ended up with a system

259
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,670
which was more performant.

260
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,750
And it was more performant

261
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,660
because there was very little
overhead from this hypervisor.

262
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,290
So we are able to provide near
bare metal-like performance

263
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,423
with our Nitro-based EC2 instances.

264
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,180
But most importantly, what's pertinent

265
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,580
to what we're talking about today

266
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,110
is we created this natural
isolation between us and the host

267
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,750
because we removed all of
the virtualization functions

268
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,013
away from the host.

269
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,350
So together the Nitro cards,
the Nitro security chip,

270
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,343
and the Nitro hypervisor, which
makes up the Nitro System,

271
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,550
provides that isolation

272
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,893
by default to our customers.

273
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,120
So, if you are looking to
deploy a workload on AWS,

274
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,130
and if your consideration is to make sure

275
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,130
your content remains protected
from operators of AWS,

276
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,280
then all you have to do is
just spin up an EC2 instance

277
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
and run your workload.

278
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,073
You're done.

279
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Because in AWS, confidential
computing is always on.

280
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,353
It's like that switch on the screen.

281
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,630
Doesn't matter which way you
flip it, it's an on on switch.

282
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,283
It's just gonna stay on for you.

283
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,130
And you can take advantage

284
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,570
of always on confidential
computing with no code changes

285
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,980
because it's no different for you.

286
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,560
All you have to do is spin
up a Nitro-based EC2 instance

287
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,703
and you're good to go,

288
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,943
and it comes at no additional cost to you.

289
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,870
So remember the considerations

290
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,270
as you start looking into capabilities

291
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,430
to implement confidential computing.

292
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,100
If your consideration is just
I need to protect my data

293
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,750
from the cloud provider,

294
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,790
you're all set with us.

295
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,143
It's on by default for you.

296
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,290
So now that's just the gist
of what this is, right?

297
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,260
But if you want to gather more details

298
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,470
about how we have implemented
the security design

299
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,790
of the Nitro System,

300
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,130
what have we done to create that degree

301
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,780
of isolation I talked about

302
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,090
and how the Nitro System was built,

303
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,860
we have a white paper we published

304
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,420
about a couple of years ago.

305
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,210
It's good bedtime reading,
it's 27 pages long.

306
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,447
So if you're really interested in it,

307
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:58,680
you know, I recommend
taking a look at that.

308
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,090
It gives you a lot of details

309
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,713
about how this was implemented.

310
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,030
In addition to the white paper,

311
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,930
there is a third party report
that you could refer to

312
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,310
by NCC group, which
examined the security design

313
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,810
of the Nitro System

314
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,620
and has reported that there
are no gaps in the Nitro System

315
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,690
that would compromise the security claims

316
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,340
that we made in that white paper.

317
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,940
We have also updated our service terms,

318
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,090
I think about two years ago to reflect

319
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,370
that there is no operator access

320
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,960
to customer content if you're using

321
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,603
a Nitro-based EC2 instance.

322
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,570
So that's how we have
addressed the requirement

323
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,120
of making sure your data remains protected

324
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,923
from AWS operators.

325
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,083
Now let's move on and talk about

326
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,690
your additional considerations.

327
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,510
What about protecting data
from customers' operators,

328
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,503
from yourselves?

329
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,220
Only when you have such
additional considerations

330
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,260
do you start thinking about capabilities

331
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,970
like Nitro Enclaves.

332
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,320
So let's first see why you need

333
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,290
the additional isolation, right?

334
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,290
On the screen, what you
see is a 30,000 foot level

335
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,810
of what an EC2 instance would look like.

336
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,180
You have your instance
and within the instance

337
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,650
you have a bunch of different users

338
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,560
who have different levels
of access to the instance.

339
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,240
You have your application

340
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,250
and third party libraries
you perhaps leverage

341
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,200
to build your application.

342
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,403
And then the OS.

343
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,280
Now, if you were to process
sensitive data in this instance,

344
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,020
assuming you had your data encrypted

345
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,980
and stored and everything,

346
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,160
and you're moving it
still encrypted in transit

347
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,110
and bringing it to the instance.

348
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,510
When you encrypted data hits the instance,

349
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,213
if you want to process it,
you have to decrypt it.

350
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,420
That's just how things
work at scale today.

351
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,570
You're gonna have to decrypt
the data inside the instance.

352
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,503
But once you decrypt the
data inside your instance,

353
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,700
you are revealing plain text

354
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
to all of the entities
you're seeing in there.

355
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,340
And that's really what you're
looking to protect from

356
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,980
when you're talking about
additional isolation.

357
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,770
And that's when you start
thinking about capabilities

358
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,540
like Nitro Enclaves.

359
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,470
With Nitro Enclaves you have the ability

360
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,230
to allocate CPU and memory resources

361
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,130
from your own EC2 instance to spin up

362
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,210
a hardened and isolated
compute environment

363
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,533
called Nitro Enclaves.

364
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:32,570
Nitro Enclave has no external
network connectivity.

365
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,040
There is no persistent storage.

366
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,010
There is no administrator
or root user access.

367
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,090
There is no way to SSH into
the enclave by default.

368
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,970
The only communication
channel that exists between,

369
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,370
from the enclave is a secure local channel

370
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,860
between the enclave and
the parent instance.

371
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,000
That's it.

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,840
That's the only channel

373
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,580
through which data comes in and goes.

374
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,100
So now if we go back to that
scenario we talked about

375
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,860
where you're bringing encrypted
data into the instance

376
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,250
and you don't want to unpack
that data in the instance,

377
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,490
take that encrypted data
and continue to pipe it

378
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,183
and forward it to the enclave,
still keeping it encrypted.

379
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,390
Once the data hits the enclave,

380
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,690
then proceed to decrypt
it within the enclave,

381
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,020
at which point nobody has
visibility into the data

382
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,150
except the trusted application

383
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,100
that's running inside the enclave,

384
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,300
which can then proceed
to process that data.

385
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,910
And that's how we achieve
additional isolation

386
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,410
and fulfill the requirement

387
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,923
of protecting content
even from yourselves.

388
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,690
Now here's the cool thing,
and in my personal opinion,

389
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,080
this is the coolest feature
that the enclave offers.

390
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,850
Nitro Enclaves can
provide proof of identity.

391
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,580
By doing this, you can be sure

392
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,220
that when you're revealing
secrets to the enclave,

393
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,260
it is the specific enclave

394
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,530
running the expected
and trusted application

395
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,903
to which you are revealing secrets too.

396
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,220
When you decide to spin up an enclave,

397
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,780
you're gonna build an enclave image.

398
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,040
And when you build the enclave image,

399
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,480
you're gonna get a set of measurements,

400
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,043
let's call it a reference hash.

401
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,330
And then when you proceed
to deploy the enclave,

402
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,950
after the enclave has been deployed,

403
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,350
the enclave can fetch
an attestation document

404
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,210
signed by the Nitro hypervisor.

405
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,080
The attestation document
contains computed values

406
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,180
about the enclave that was launched.

407
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,690
It includes information
about the enclave image,

408
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,820
the application in the enclave,

409
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,090
the parent instance ID, IAM roles,

410
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,383
and a few other things.

411
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,193
These are the computed
cryptographic hashes.

412
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,980
So when the enclave wants
to go and access secrets,

413
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,920
what it's gonna do is present
that attestation document

414
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,070
to the entity it's
requesting secrets from.

415
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,070
And that entity is gonna compare
this attestation document

416
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,840
against the reference hash we talked about

417
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,190
when you built the enclave.

418
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,720
And if the values match, that is the proof

419
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,540
the entity needs to make sure

420
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,810
that the enclave has provided
proof of its integrity

421
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,000
and it can now establish
trust with the enclave

422
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,250
to share secrets with it.

423
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,970
This is a high level of
how attestation works.

424
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm not gonna get deeper into this

425
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,690
because William's gonna come back later

426
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,180
and talk to you about
attestation in great detail.

427
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,790
He's gonna show you how to use it.

428
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,990
But the mental model

429
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,700
for the new capabilities we have launched

430
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,280
and capabilities that have
existed like Nitro Enclaves,

431
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,870
the mental model is the same.

432
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,750
At build time, you get a reference hash.

433
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,600
At runtime, you get a set of hashes.

434
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,010
Are these two matching?

435
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,940
If they match, then you
know you can share secrets.

436
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,790
That's how we have established trust.

437
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,320
Nitro Enclaves come with first
class integration with KMS.

438
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,120
KMS is our Key Management Service.

439
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,900
A lot of customers who
use enclaves also use KMS.

440
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,180
I was talking to folks
in the audience earlier

441
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,060
who were inquiring about
how to manage keys,

442
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,530
how to bring your own keys.

443
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,760
So we're happy to talk about
that later after the session.

444
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,370
But I just wanna leave
you with the thought that

445
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,930
KMS is how you're going to use keys

446
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,280
to bring it inside the enclave

447
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,560
so you can then decrypt
the data we talked about.

448
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,620
But to do this, KMS now
is that other entity

449
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,440
we discussed earlier with attestation.

450
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,320
KMS is gonna have to verify
that the right enclave

451
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,530
with the right application is
asking it to share secrets.

452
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,750
And with attestation it's able to do that.

453
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,800
And what we've done for you

454
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,350
is integrated this whole attestation flow.

455
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,360
But you're by no means tied to KMS.

456
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,970
If you wanna use your own key
store, feel free to use it.

457
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,100
You just have to build
the attestation yourself.

458
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,290
What we've done with KMS
has made it easy for you.

459
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,790
That's it.

460
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,220
So here's a quick summary of
everything we talked about

461
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,640
in terms of protecting
content even from yourselves.

462
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,840
With Nitro Enclaves,

463
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,510
you achieve additional isolation security.

464
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,940
There's no external network
connectivity, no storage,

465
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,610
no administrative root user access.

466
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,020
And the only communication channel

467
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,000
is a secure local channel.

468
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,310
Nitro Enclaves are highly flexible.

469
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,660
They are processor agnostic.

470
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,510
So it doesn't matter what instance type,

471
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,340
what CPU instance type

472
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,650
you're trying to leverage enclaves from.

473
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,070
Could be Intel CPUs, it could
be AMD, it could be Graviton.

474
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Nitro Enclaves are functional
in all of those instances.

475
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,710
And more importantly, bringing you back

476
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,990
to that flexibility we
talked about earlier,

477
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,930
you can choose varying
combinations of CPU and memory

478
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,370
to allocate to your enclave

479
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,920
depending on the demands of your workload.

480
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,010
So it could be more memory,
less CPU, whatever you need,

481
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,350
you can choose the combination yourself.

482
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,640
Pretty flexible.

483
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,910
And lastly, enclaves come with
cryptographic attestation,

484
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,260
which helps it prove its identity
so it can establish trust.

485
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,200
And you get all of this isolation again

486
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
at no additional cost.

487
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,850
If you're using your EC2 instance,

488
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,920
all you're doing is
dedicating CPU and memory

489
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,120
from the same instance
to create an enclave.

490
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,130
So, that's the high level of enclaves.

491
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,530
I'm more than happy to take
questions about it later.

492
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,000
We have more planned for you today,

493
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,890
so I'm gonna keep moving.

494
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,940
Here are some customers that
have used Enclaves successfully

495
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,670
and this is just a subset of
customers who are using it.

496
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,740
The reason we chose to show you this

497
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,200
is to give you an idea of the different

498
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,140
verticals and segments that
take advantage of capabilities

499
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,340
doing Nitro Enclaves.

500
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,770
So you can see that our
customers in the ad tech space,

501
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,770
customers in financial,
traditional financial industry,

502
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,510
customers within the
Web3 blockchain space,

503
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,510
crypto exchanges, privileged
access management customers.

504
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,400
There's a wide variety of
customers who can take advantage

505
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,830
of such foundational capabilities

506
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,633
to implement confidential computing.

507
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,520
As you go through this
week, I wanna direct you

508
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,480
to some sessions as well.

509
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,340
Two of the large payment
processors are presenting this week

510
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,500
on their use of confidential compute

511
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,540
and Nitro Enclaves at AWS.

512
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,760
So both Visa and
MasterCard will be talking

513
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,230
about real-time payments

514
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,420
and how they have leveraged enclaves

515
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,850
to build secure and low latency solutions

516
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,770
to do payment processing.

517
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,140
Coinbase will also be speaking this week

518
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,060
actually with me on Friday

519
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,620
to talk about their implementation

520
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,570
of secure wallets with enclaves.

521
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,150
It is actually a session
focused on agentic payments.

522
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,280
So if that's something
that tickles your interest,

523
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,100
I invite you to join us for that session.

524
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,760
And Coinbase will talk about
their use of x402 protocol

525
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,290
to integrate with agentic payments

526
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,480
and how they integrated
Nitro Enclaves-based wallet

527
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,830
for the solution.

528
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,000
There's also additional reading

529
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,870
on how customers like
Fireblocks have implemented

530
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,850
custody solutions with enclaves

531
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,490
and how Stripe has done
key management solutions

532
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,920
and Brave rewards computation solutions

533
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,320
using blockchain technology.

534
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,140
So these are all what we have already done

535
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,730
and accomplished with customers

536
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,430
and we'll continue to
work with you on these.

537
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,730
But now things are starting
to shift a little bit.

538
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,730
AI is here and with AI
there are new workloads

539
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,020
and the requirements that
we talked about earlier

540
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,463
have evolved a little bit.

541
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,730
With the new AI workloads,

542
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,190
customers want to now make sure

543
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,017
they're running their workloads on GPUs

544
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,303
and AI accelerators for the large part.

545
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,600
So whatever capabilities
we talked about earlier

546
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,240
need to be made available on all of this.

547
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,830
Customers want to protect the models

548
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,480
and the weights that
they're bringing inside

549
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,793
the compute entity.

550
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,490
Not only that, they want to proceed

551
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,260
to seal these models and weights to that

552
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,230
so they can be really sure
it is the right instance.

553
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,413
It's the right isolated
environment that's fetching data,

554
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,560
that's fetching the model.

555
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,110
In addition to that, no surprise with AI,

556
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,120
you need greater bandwidth.

557
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,690
So this consideration with no
external network connectivity

558
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,360
was starting to create
some friction points

559
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,120
and customers also wanted
storage, access to storage

560
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,680
because they need a lot more data now.

561
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,683
It's not just about dropping
a small payload or a few keys.

562
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,140
And all of this again
with no code changes.

563
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,930
So we started to look into this

564
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,430
and launched a new capability,

565
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,380
which William is now gonna
come and talk to you about.

566
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,897
I invite William to talk to
you about EC2 attestation

567
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,940
and take you through
the rest of the session.

568
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,020
I'll come back and close it out

569
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,397
with some resources for you later.

570
00:26:27,397 --> 00:26:28,673
Thank you.

571
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:31,201
(audience applauding)

572
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:32,034
- I got it.

573
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,380
(audience applauding)

574
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,670
Thank you, Arvind.

575
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,870
Good morning.

576
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,280
My name is William Yap

577
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,430
I'm a principal product
manager for Compute Services.

578
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,380
I've been handling confidential computing

579
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,730
for the past six years.

580
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,530
So all the stuff that Arvind talked about

581
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,850
they're called Nitro.

582
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,520
Nitro Enclaves, NitroTPM, Nitro System

583
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,340
are capabilities that
we've worked on building.

584
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,280
And so, in this talk, I'm gonna try

585
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,390
to give you some of the insights

586
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,770
of what we were thinking about

587
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,260
when we're building these capabilities.

588
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,960
Now, Arvind mentioned AI, you know.

589
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,390
AI is something definitely
that's caught a lot of interest

590
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,710
the last few years,

591
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,190
but we're gonna use AI as a template,

592
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,600
a reference case study

593
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,540
to talk about the new
confidential computing features

594
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,130
that we've built.

595
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,700
And 2025 has been a busy
year for the Nitro team

596
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,000
and we are excited to
tell you all about this.

597
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,710
Generative AI is interesting
for confidential computing

598
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,680
because of the sheer
number of sensitive data

599
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,660
that you're looking to bring there,

600
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,690
as well as the multiple
parties that are involved.

601
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,210
I've simplified what it
means here for user data,

602
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,490
but what I'm talking
about, it could be prompts,

603
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,950
it could be your business
data, financial information,

604
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,260
personal data, things you bring through

605
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,810
via RAG, knowledge bases and all,

606
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,810
These are things that you wanna protect.

607
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,530
The second thing that's
sensitive is the model itself.

608
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,920
For close models that the
model weight represents

609
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,590
significant investment
to train those models.

610
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,930
You would like to protect that too.

611
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,730
And depending on the type of outputs

612
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,420
that you're producing,
it could be sensitive.

613
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,290
So as you can see, multiple
sources of sensitive data

614
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,533
and different parties
that's owning each of it.

615
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,800
And we wanna protect that.

616
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,010
So which when you have
multiple sources of data

617
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,940
that are going into the
models for inferencing,

618
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,320
we're seeing customers, enterprise

619
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,090
who are looking for ways to give stronger

620
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,630
data privacy assurances
to their end users.

621
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,270
Or if they wanna hand over their data,

622
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,610
what are the assurances
that we can give them?

623
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,720
So let's break it down.

624
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,723
Let's break it down into three goals here.

625
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,400
The first goal that we wanna
solve is we wanna make sure

626
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,390
at the base foundational
infrastructure level,

627
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,400
the infrastructure
provider has no mechanism

628
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,393
to access the data.

629
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,953
The cloud provider has no
mechanism to access the data.

630
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,010
The second goal that you wanna make

631
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,500
is to make sure that
when you go up one level,

632
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,800
the service provider, the enterprises

633
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,570
also do not have access to the data

634
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,420
that's gonna be used for inferencing.

635
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,970
And lastly, you have encrypted data

636
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,800
that's going into this environment.

637
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,990
You need a way to prove
that this environment

638
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,000
is what it says it is.

639
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,820
It's isolated before data gets decrypted,

640
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,950
before data gets processed.

641
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,570
So we're gonna tackle this together,

642
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,000
we're gonna work through this as a group

643
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,450
to try to solve this problem.

644
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,700
And using AI as a template,

645
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,860
we're gonna look at how from AI

646
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,960
we can look at other case studies as well.

647
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,240
Item number one, we solved
that pretty quickly on EC2.

648
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,720
As Arvind mentioned, the Nitro System

649
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,220
has no operator access.

650
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,710
It's by design is something that we have,

651
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,060
we spent a multi-year
investment to build the chips,

652
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,390
the software with the
number one design principle

653
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,730
to making sure that no AWS operator

654
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,773
has a mechanism to access the data.

655
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,320
Our EC2 Nitro instance is very different

656
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,930
from the classical
traditional virtual machines

657
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,430
where you get this type of protection

658
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,050
and that's gonna give us

659
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,263
a very strong foundation to build upon.

660
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,360
So number one checks out very
easily for you as the customer

661
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,480
because on AWS we spend
significant investment

662
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,520
to make sure that's easy.

663
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,020
Let's focus on number two.

664
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,240
How do we make sure there's no mechanism

665
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,970
for you as the enterprise
as a service provider

666
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,383
to access the data yourself?

667
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,890
Arvind mentioned that we needed to evolve.

668
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,500
Your requirements are evolving.

669
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,822
You want confidential computing and GPUs,

670
00:30:48,822 --> 00:30:50,250
you want confidential computing

671
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,130
with networking, with storage.

672
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,290
And when we, you know, me
as the product manager,

673
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,323
when I look at building
this on the Nitro Enclaves,

674
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,850
as we add more and more
capabilities to the Nitro Enclaves,

675
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,760
it's gonna start to look
more like an instance.

676
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,020
So instead of evolving
Nitro Enclaves that way,

677
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,440
what we've done is that
we've taken the capabilities

678
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,020
that you like in Nitro Enclaves

679
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,173
and bring it back to the
regular Nitro EC2 instance.

680
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,160
And this is what we have launched.

681
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,953
We call it EC2 Instance Attestation.

682
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,390
It's a capability that makes
it easier for you to validate

683
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,690
that only trusted software, trusted code

684
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,481
is running on your EC2 instance.

685
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,850
You know, before this
you can definitely build

686
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,930
trusted EC2 instance.

687
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,860
You can definitely build an
EC2 instance that has no SSH.

688
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,590
But what you have over
here is a capability

689
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,930
to evidence that, to prove that

690
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,023
and to allow decryption of
data only when that's true.

691
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,943
If you notice one thing, we
didn't give it an AI name.

692
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,520
Just called EC2 Instance Attestation

693
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,680
because we see this as a way

694
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,840
that customers are gonna use across

695
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,700
all different types of use case.

696
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,860
We see this as something very powerful

697
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,023
that you're gonna use generally.

698
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,300
So, what is EC2 attestation?

699
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,673
It comprises of several capabilities

700
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:19,233
and I'm gonna talk a bit about right now.

701
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,370
At the base layer we
have the Nitro System.

702
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:28,370
This is a Nitro EC2 instance,
it has zero operator access.

703
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,050
We have this device that you can attach

704
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,840
to an EC2 instance called the NitroTPM,

705
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,750
the Nitro Trusted Platform Module.

706
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,490
This is something we have already.

707
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,010
This just follows the TPM 2.0 standards

708
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,200
and it does measurement,
it does attestation

709
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,643
for the EC2 instance.

710
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,550
You can do this on an EC2 instance

711
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,780
that has an AI accelerator.

712
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,790
So many of our GPU instance,

713
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,013
our Trainium2 has this capability.

714
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,460
This is the starting point.

715
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,860
Let's look at the new stuff.

716
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,470
The first new stuff that we have launched

717
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,860
is Attestable Amazon Machine Images.

718
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,713
This is a new way to build AMIs.

719
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,370
When you build it, you'll
get a cryptographic hash

720
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,233
that represents the content,
the root process of that AMI.

721
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,330
We're gonna dig deeper into that shortly.

722
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,380
Next thing that's new
NitroTPM Attestation Document.

723
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,830
Now you can generate the same
style attestation document

724
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,990
that you get from Nitro Enclaves

725
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,293
with NitroTPM on a regular
Nitro EC2 instance.

726
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,000
This makes the attestation
process very easy to do.

727
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,130
You no longer have to
do the multi-step dance,

728
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,050
you just have a document that's signed

729
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,883
with all the necessary information.

730
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
And the last thing that we have launched

731
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,500
is that we know that every customer

732
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,490
is gonna need to figure out
key management and attestation

733
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,770
and how you're gonna
have the data encrypted

734
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,370
and only allow decryption
when the attestation passes.

735
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,730
And so, we've done the
heavy lift for our customers

736
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,670
by integrating that with AWS KMS,

737
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,923
integrating NitroTPM with AWS KMS.

738
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,070
With these three capabilities combined,

739
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,690
this gives you the tools to
configure your EC2 instance

740
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,090
into an isolated compute environment,

741
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,213
into an environment you
yourself cannot get access to.

742
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,953
Let's dig into each and
every one of them in detail.

743
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,033
The first one, attestable AMIs.

744
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,260
It's a new way of building AMIs

745
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,560
where at the time you complete building

746
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,713
and creating that AMI, you
get a corresponding hash.

747
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,860
It contains a measurement of everything

748
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,260
you have put inside the AMI.

749
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,590
And the hash that you get from this AMI

750
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,240
is your reference measurement.

751
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,187
This is the true hash

752
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:03,120
'cause you know all the ingredients

753
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,770
that you have put inside the AMI,

754
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,740
you know that this is the true one

755
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,900
and you're gonna keep it securely

756
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,970
to validate against later.

757
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,590
Let's keep that in mind.

758
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,330
So, if I go back to the problem

759
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,490
that we're trying to solve here,

760
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,310
you now have an inferencing environment

761
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,590
where you wanna lock yourself out.

762
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,960
What kind of configurations can I do here?

763
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,040
How should I set it up in a
way that I don't have access?

764
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,860
Well, we do have some best
practices to share here

765
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,903
and this is documented as well.

766
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,840
And I say best practices
because it does vary

767
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,550
according to the type of use cases

768
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,980
depending on how you're
planning to use it.

769
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,720
But the first one, the most important one,

770
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,650
you wanna remove all forms
of interactive access.

771
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,540
What I mean by interactive access?

772
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,410
No SSH, no serial console,

773
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,623
no SSM, and the likes.

774
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,500
And we're not talking just
about disabling a user

775
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,110
access to the SSH function.

776
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,720
What we're talking
about is the SSHD daemon

777
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,250
is not even installed.

778
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,320
There's no mechanism at all.

779
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,303
First one is removing that access.

780
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,380
Second thing is that you wanna validate

781
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,410
and ensure that only trusted code

782
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,323
are running inside that
instance, inside your AMI.

783
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,830
Because you're doing highly
sensitive processing,

784
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,560
you don't want to install
all types of packages

785
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,483
that may or may not be necessary.

786
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,657
You wanna look at only
the necessary packages,

787
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:40,503
the only necessary tools to
be able to run that workload.

788
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,580
The third thing, you wanna have a network.

789
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,200
So since you have networking right now,

790
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,310
you wanna have a network firewall

791
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,790
within the instance boundary

792
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,043
to make sure you get
protected access there.

793
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,790
Number four, you wanna
make sure that all storage

794
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,123
and file systems is
immutable and read-only.

795
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,760
So now you have an isolated environment.

796
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,890
You can't get in, nobody can get in.

797
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,230
How do you make good use about it?

798
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,933
So borrowing the stuff we
did with the Nitro System,

799
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,200
we can look at building APIs.

800
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,230
Not just any APIs, build trusted APIs

801
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,130
that needs to be authenticated,
that needs to be verified.

802
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,640
It's gonna be logged, authorized
before it can be used.

803
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,850
And ensure because you are
the design of these APIs,

804
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,980
ensure that this APIs doesn't do anything

805
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,290
that's not supposed to
do, that's not documented,

806
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,950
that doesn't interact in with
customer data or user data

807
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,293
in a unapproved way.

808
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,520
So these are the five best practices

809
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,140
and you can put these ingredients

810
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,963
into an isolated compute
configuration file.

811
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,390
That's the ingredients.

812
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,610
Let's put it into a recipe.

813
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,130
At the base layer, you
have an Amazon Linux,

814
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,650
just a base image, very minimal.

815
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,070
You have your trusted code

816
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,570
and then you've got your configuration.

817
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,023
Now we work with an open
source tool called Kiwi.

818
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,010
This is an open source tool
that allows you to build images

819
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,100
where you can provide the recipe

820
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,440
to the Kiwi tool that we have

821
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,070
integrated with and
generate the trusted AMI

822
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,023
with the corresponding hash.

823
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,410
Now remember this is your reference hash.

824
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,450
This is the hash that you trust,

825
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,220
you provided the ingredients,

826
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,840
you verified the ingredients.

827
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,740
This is the hash you trust.

828
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,390
Let's keep that in mind
because we're gonna use that.

829
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,320
With NitroTPM, when you
launch an EC2 instance

830
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,600
and you enable NitroTPM,

831
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,760
the NitroTPM device gets attached there

832
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,170
to your EC2 instance

833
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,260
and at launch it will measure everything

834
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,150
about that EC2 instance.

835
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,570
And notice something, the GPU and AI chip

836
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,693
are within the protected
boundary of the EC2 instance.

837
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,850
When you measure it, you
get a calculated hash

838
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,750
and you can compare this
calculated hash of this instance,

839
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,030
check it against your reference hash

840
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,970
to see is this the instance
running the configurations

841
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,180
that I've stated that
have zero operator access?

842
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,673
If it's true, I've done it the right way.

843
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,660
So, before this you can absolutely

844
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,140
create an EC2 instance that has no SSH.

845
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,320
Difference here is that you
can get the measurements

846
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,570
and compare against that.

847
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,110
That's how we solve goal number two.

848
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,100
No mechanism for you to access user data,

849
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,750
the isolated compute environment.

850
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,870
Now we're gonna talk a bit more about

851
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,190
how we're gonna solve number three.

852
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,780
And in order to do number three,

853
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,640
let's go back from the beginning.

854
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,103
How does cryptographic attestation works?

855
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,740
Well, the reason why you
wanna know why attestation is,

856
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,420
is how do you know your
instance is truly yours?

857
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,790
How do you know instance I123

858
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,210
or instance A here has the right code,

859
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,850
right measurements that you have stated?

860
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,870
I think if you spend time

861
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,790
you can definitely figure that part out.

862
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,060
But imagine if you have
hundreds, thousands,

863
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,710
hundreds or thousands of instance

864
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,300
that problems gets multiplied.

865
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,930
We need a more scalable way to determine

866
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,850
whether this is the right instance,

867
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,440
your trusted instance

868
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,183
before you're sending
highly sensitive data to it.

869
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,130
For the humans, we kinda
solved this problem already.

870
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,540
I know most of us, we
travel into Vegas by plane.

871
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,630
We have to go through,
everybody has their passport

872
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,900
or identity card, real ID

873
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,243
to get over here in Vegas.

874
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,680
If you think about that,
an attestation document

875
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,340
is kinda like a passport
to an EC2 instance

876
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,333
or to an enclave.

877
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,610
Instead of a name,

878
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,030
instead of the date of birth and location,

879
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,740
you get measurements

880
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,320
and it contains measurements of the code

881
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,080
that's present on boot,
the boot up process,

882
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,330
all the configurations

883
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,860
and the passport has to be issued

884
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,690
by an authorized authority.

885
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,390
You know, anyone can just issue it.

886
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,660
And so, the attestation document
that you're getting here

887
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,180
is gonna be signed by
the Nitro hypervisor,

888
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,113
the Nitro System.

889
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,130
That is the first part of attestation,

890
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,033
being able to the attestation
document to produce it.

891
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,440
That's the other side,
another side of attestation.

892
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,430
How do I verify it?

893
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,533
Once you present the passport,

894
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,330
which database do I get to
make sure that the values

895
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,850
that I'm looking at the
passport is correct.

896
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,950
That's the validation piece.

897
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,950
And you can figure out
the validation piece

898
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,340
by having your service
refer to the reference hash.

899
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,080
Remember at the beginning
when we build the AMI,

900
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,480
you get that reference hash?

901
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,860
You can take note of that,

902
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,920
get your service to look at it

903
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,170
or to check against that.

904
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,490
But the challenge there is that

905
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,380
remember we wanna encrypt the data

906
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,260
and send it to the isolated
compute environment

907
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,640
for processing.

908
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,800
So it's not just sufficient to do that.

909
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,440
You kinda need to figure it out

910
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,920
and add key management
somewhere in between as well.

911
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,470
So borrowing what Arvind
said with what we have done

912
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,850
with Nitro Enclaves.

913
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,300
We know every customer is gonna
try to figure that part out,

914
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,760
so we have done the heavy
lifting for you as well.

915
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,397
So we've integrated
attestation with the AWS KMS.

916
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,137
When I say integration,
what I mean here is that

917
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:48,137
AWS KMS has the ability to
ingest attestation document.

918
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,700
It knows how to compare the measurements

919
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,980
against your trusted measurements.

920
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,600
You would place your trusted measurement

921
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,910
as just a KMS as key policy.

922
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,980
It will compare against that.

923
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,000
The other thing it does as well,

924
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,380
it knows how to compare that

925
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,270
and check the validation
of the Nitro System

926
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,620
that it's correctly signed.

927
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,710
This is the capability that makes it easy

928
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,320
for you to do multi-party computation

929
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,913
with an EC2 instance.

930
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,443
Now, we've look to all the
pieces that we have launched.

931
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,570
Let's put it all together

932
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,400
and look at how we can make a flow there.

933
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,010
And the flow is gonna be simple

934
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,560
because it's designed to be simple.

935
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,723
So if user data that you wanna protect,

936
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,480
you encrypted it and you're
sending it to an EC2 instance

937
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,960
where you have configured no SSH,

938
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,160
no interactive access.

939
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
You have where you built that isolation.

940
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,203
It goes to the EC2 instance.

941
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,920
EC2 instance would then send
the attestation document

942
00:43:57,906 --> 00:44:01,860
to AWS KMS that says, Hey,
I'm the real instance.

943
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,630
Check out my configuration.

944
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,065
Here's the measurement.

945
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:07,530
AWS KMS takes that,

946
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,960
compares that against your key policy.

947
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,280
Compares that against the real,

948
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,160
your reference measurement there.

949
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,930
If it checks out,

950
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,500
it will release the encrypted data key

951
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,240
back to the EC2 instance

952
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,170
where only the EC2
instance can decrypt it.

953
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,783
So now you have user data
that have been decrypted.

954
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,313
You can process it in that
LLM, do that inferencing,

955
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,170
and depending on whether the
outputs are sensitive or not,

956
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,183
you can encrypt it and send it back out.

957
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,490
This is the flow

958
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,740
that we think is very
powerful for customers.

959
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,197
By the end of this week we
have, as Arvind mentioned,

960
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:52,230
we have workshops, we have code talks.

961
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,750
Everyone can leave Vegas with
an application that does this

962
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,400
and we're gonna have the
workshop online as well

963
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,873
if we don't get to it.

964
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,350
This is how we solve
the three privacy goals.

965
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,580
And we've made that process
very easy for our customers

966
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,230
by providing the combination
of these tools to do it.

967
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,560
Now, I promise at the beginning of my talk

968
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,218
that we're gonna talk more about AI.

969
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,790
I mean we're just using this
as a reference case study.

970
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,750
So let's talk a bit more about
how we're gonna look at this

971
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,313
and how does this vary.

972
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,913
In the example that I provided earlier,

973
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,360
you have this flow here,

974
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,220
you have the end user
that you wanna protect,

975
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,690
end user data you wanna protect,

976
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,120
you have the model data
that you wanna protect.

977
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,880
And the processing in the
middle is inferencing.

978
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,573
But let's say we take away
inferencing for a second here.

979
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,530
And instead of the model
provider and user data,

980
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,900
we say let's have two hospitals.

981
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,830
We have patient data and
hospital A and hospital B

982
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,980
are saying that if we can
find a way to collaborate,

983
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,780
share some patient data,

984
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,220
we can get some metrics,

985
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,300
we can get some information

986
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,820
that's gonna help with our research.

987
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,210
This is a piracy
preserving way of doing it

988
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,000
where you can encrypt the
data, send it to an environment

989
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,280
that neither party can get access to.

990
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,620
Do the processing that
both parties have agreed to

991
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,113
and only allow decryption
of data when that's true.

992
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,230
So if we've changed the
processing in the middle,

993
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,340
we changed the party

994
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,070
but diagram looks similar,

995
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,090
it's a multi-party computation process.

996
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,180
Now let's change the
hospitals to something else.

997
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,143
Consumer goods.

998
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,080
Let's say you have two different companies

999
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,710
that are processing user preferences.

1000
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,910
In the ad tech space they
wanna tokenize user identity.

1001
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,940
So instead of looking at William's

1002
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,650
preferences for shoes,

1003
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,600
they're gonna look at token
AVC's preferences for shoes.

1004
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,510
The sensitive processing part of this

1005
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,310
is a tokenization process.

1006
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,100
Changing the name William into a token.

1007
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,890
'Cause if I get access to
that tokenization engine,

1008
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,900
I can reverse it, I can see it.

1009
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,110
You wanna run that in an
isolated compute environment

1010
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,180
in a way that neither
parties can can do it.

1011
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,213
So we are seeing a lot of
interest in attack space.

1012
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,960
Federated learning.

1013
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,380
Let's say you can't send the
patient data out, you know?

1014
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,520
Cancer centers, hospitals
sometimes have a requirement

1015
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,260
that they can't do that.

1016
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,140
So with federated learning
is what they're doing instead

1017
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,650
is that they're trading the data locally,

1018
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,270
building the models locally

1019
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,100
and just sending the model weights out

1020
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,423
to a central location.

1021
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,990
The central location will be an aggregator

1022
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,820
that combines all the
model weights together

1023
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,490
to get a global model
where all the parties

1024
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,263
can use and gain benefits to.

1025
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,140
What I've changed here in this diagram

1026
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,320
is just a number of
users and the processing.

1027
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,840
The concept that we have
here is still the same,

1028
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,670
multi-party computation

1029
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,340
building the isolated
environment that neither party,

1030
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,650
that no party can get access to.

1031
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,470
Encrypting the data,
whether it's model weights

1032
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,930
to sensitive data,

1033
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:25,380
sending it to the
environment and decrypting it

1034
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,943
when it's proven is to be true.

1035
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,120
So I hope we learn the new process today.

1036
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,830
As I mentioned, everyone
here can leave Vegas

1037
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,320
with the new application that does this

1038
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,050
with a confidential computing application.

1039
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,360
I'm gonna hand it over
to my colleague, Arvind,

1040
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,770
who will give you more resources

1041
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,701
on how you can leverage
those capabilities.

1042
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:56,951
(audience applauding)

1043
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:01,650
- Thank you, William.

1044
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,137
So moving forward, let's talk about,

1045
00:49:04,137 --> 00:49:07,080
you know, to summarize everything
we talked about over here,

1046
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,790
about confidential compute, right?

1047
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,590
You heard us talk about
different capabilities

1048
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,183
for different considerations.

1049
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,845
We just have the Nitro System

1050
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:18,030
upon which our EC2 instances are based on.

1051
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,670
So if you're just looking
to protect from us

1052
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,220
to spin up an instance, you're good to go.

1053
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,860
Now if you're looking
for a very opinionated,

1054
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,330
isolated compute environment

1055
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,049
that's hardened already for you,

1056
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,299
you have Nitron Enclaves.

1057
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,540
Now if you're looking for AI use cases,

1058
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,860
you're looking to protect your models,

1059
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,370
you protect your weights
on GPUs and accelerators

1060
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,140
and William talked to you at great length

1061
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,530
about EC2 attestation,
how to use that on GPU

1062
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,443
and AI accelerator-enabled instances.

1063
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,320
All of this, however,
comes with a common theme

1064
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,400
and the common theme is Nitro.

1065
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,770
And what makes it really special

1066
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,253
is that with any of these
that we talked about,

1067
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,180
it comes with the assurance
of zero operator access,

1068
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,040
no mechanism whatsoever.

1069
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,770
And now, if you notice the
language a little bit different

1070
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,690
from no operator access to zero

1071
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,750
because if you're just
using an EC2 instance,

1072
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,730
you're protected from us.

1073
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,880
But now when you tag on the
additional capabilities,

1074
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,710
you've also protected from yourself.

1075
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,450
That's really how we're trending towards

1076
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,733
that zero operator access, right?

1077
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,940
And then as I mentioned
earlier, with all of this,

1078
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,070
you get near bare metal-like performance

1079
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,413
because of the way we architected it.

1080
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,610
So between the virtualized
instances in the bare metal,

1081
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,960
it's like a single digit
percentage difference.

1082
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,290
Highly performant.

1083
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,313
So very well-suited for your AI workloads.

1084
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,330
And with the new launch,
we have now supported it

1085
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,280
across all of our instance types.

1086
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,742
So you're not restricted to CPUs.

1087
00:50:52,742 --> 00:50:54,420
You could use GPUs, AI accelerators,

1088
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,940
any CPU if you choose to use
enclaves and all of that.

1089
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,200
So there's a lot of flexibility

1090
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,143
with the instance types we are offering.

1091
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,390
And lastly, as I mentioned
with attestation,

1092
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:07,020
we already ensured we are
integrating all of this with KMS.

1093
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,420
So for most customers who
leverage these capabilities

1094
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,590
with our Key Management Service,

1095
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,840
it's already built out for you.

1096
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,050
But again, you're not,
you know, bound to it.

1097
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,610
You can always use your own key stores,

1098
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,560
use your own external services,

1099
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,880
you just have to learn how to consume

1100
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,800
that attestation document

1101
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,570
and then build it out yourself.

1102
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,550
And lastly, with the new capabilities

1103
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,050
that William talked about today,

1104
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,540
we have launched it in
all commercial regions

1105
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,700
and GovCloud as well.

1106
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,800
So if you are working on mission-critical

1107
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,560
applications and workloads and
you're leveraging GovCloud,

1108
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,900
all of this is now available on GovCloud

1109
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,763
in addition to commercial regions.

1110
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,600
Now, if any of this piqued your curiosity

1111
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,520
and you are looking to build more,

1112
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,890
we do have a couple more sessions

1113
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,380
specifically on this topic.

1114
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,480
One is a code talk

1115
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,810
where we will deep dive into
demystifying attestation.

1116
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,210
We'll actually open the attestation code

1117
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,037
and walk you through
what's been implemented

1118
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,213
and how to use it.

1119
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,450
And then there's another workshop

1120
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,450
that you're welcome to join tomorrow

1121
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,270
on creating trusted execution environments

1122
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,000
specifically for
generative AI applications.

1123
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,090
So we will show you how to
stand up the whole thing

1124
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,093
with a GPU or inferencing
or retaining based instance.

1125
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,750
I would like to thank all
of you for taking the time

1126
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,190
to listen to us today

1127
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,360
and come join the discussion

1128
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,150
for confidential compute
at re:Invent 2025.

1129
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,481
Thank you so much.

1130
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,731
(audience applauding)
