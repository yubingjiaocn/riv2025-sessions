1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:01,968
- All right, hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,810
Thank you so much for joining us today

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,410
on this first morning of re:Invent 2025.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,170
Just if you wish, a show
of hands for any of you

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,740
who this is not your
first session for today.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,470
Nice, I got some early
starters, I like it.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,540
All right, so my name is Christine Megit,

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,870
and I am a Microsoft Licensing
Specialist here at AWS,

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,880
and I'm joined today by my colleagues,

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,380
GianPaolo and Valerie.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,610
And today, we're gonna speak to you

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,610
about enterprise software
licensing and optimization on AWS.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,470
There is gonna be a focus
on Microsoft licensing

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,243
just because we do have some new features

15
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:37,770
that we wanna highlight today,

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,960
so we're excited to share that with you.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,420
And before I begin, I'm just gonna start

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,670
with a bit of a quote.

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,200
Most presentations like to start

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,630
with an impactful or motivational quote.

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,210
I'm not sure that's what we have here,

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,060
but this is something that
we do here from customers

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,810
on a regular basis at least once a week.

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,930
So Microsoft licensing especially
can be really difficult,

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,210
and we're here today to kind of break down

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,810
some of that complexity for you.

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,610
Microsoft licensing is complex,

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,360
there's different agreement
types, different license models,

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,390
is the product eligible for
License Mobility benefits?

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,130
Show of hands if anyone knows

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,963
about License Mobility benefits.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,153
Good, all right, nice.

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,110
So today, we're gonna speak
to you about the optimization

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,230
and licensing assessment,
Val's gonna kick that off.

35
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,450
That's a fully funded program that we have

36
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,770
for Enterprise workloads,
not just Microsoft licensing.

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,180
I'm gonna take over again

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,000
and I'm gonna talk to you about
bringing your own license,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,030
as well as some of our
License Included offerings.

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,250
And then I'll go into some
licensing optimization

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,220
best practices, including
highlighting some new features

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,930
that we are going to announce

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,033
that will help you save some costs.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,120
Then I'll hand it over to GianPaolo,

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
and he's going to speak to you

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,780
about Optimize CPU for License Included,

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,910
which is one of the new
features we wanna highlight,

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,220
and also provide a live demo

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,103
for AWS Compute Optimizer
and Optimize CPU.

50
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,490
Then we'll kick it back over
to Valerie who's gonna discuss

51
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,490
how to get started, how to
start realizing these savings

52
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,853
and these new features, especially
through our OLA program.

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,813
All right, I'm gonna hand
it over to you Valerie, so.

54
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,390
- Thanks Christy, awesome.

55
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,070
All right, so a question for the audience,

56
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,200
how many of you have ever
googled Microsoft licensing

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,480
and immediately regretted it?

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,170
Yes, all right, I see a lot
of hands, that was surprising.

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,583
Great audience engagement.

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,400
All right, so how do you
make informed decisions

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,860
about migrating to the cloud
without becoming an expert

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,480
in optimization strategies

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,850
or getting that PhD in Microsoft licensing

64
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,173
that Christine mentioned?

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,060
Well, the good news is that
we have a program built

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,080
at AWS for this.

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,390
So the Optimization and
Licensing Assessment program

68
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,540
or OLA program that Christine
mentioned is purposely built

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,730
to help you optimize both your compute

70
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,410
and your licensing costs
when you're considering

71
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,060
a migration to AWS.

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,940
My name's Valerie Rosenfield,
I'm a part of the OLA program.

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,980
I've been on this team
for about five years,

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,280
serving our customers as a
Migration Assessment Specialist.

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,730
So I help customers when they
are considering migrating

76
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,470
all workloads, but specifically for today,

77
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,720
Microsoft workloads to the cloud,

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
review what they have
in their environment,

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,430
understand what their key
business priorities are,

80
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,080
any open questions that they have,

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,150
and then recommend an assessment process

82
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,950
that will get them answers
in the most efficient manner.

83
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,540
There we go, there's the OLA slide.

84
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,940
Awesome, all right, so OLA
is all about simplifying

85
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,043
your migration and your licensing journey.

86
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,250
What are the benefits for customers?

87
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,600
Actually I'll ask another question.

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,130
How many of you are customers

89
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,413
who are already running on AWS today?

90
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,310
Oh, nice, awesome, you will
love this presentation then.

91
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,950
How many customers are
considering migrating

92
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,970
to the cloud in one to two years,

93
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,603
but don't run any workloads
yet on AWS, anybody?

94
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,653
Awesome, okay, any
partners in the audience?

95
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,323
Awesome, awesome.

96
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,910
Okay, that's great context for talking

97
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,640
about how OLA helps simplify
the migration journey.

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,370
It's good to know who we
have here in the audience.

99
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,280
First off, OLA is a data-driven
assessment that is built

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,440
to answer three key
questions when customers

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,840
are considering migration
or post migration,

102
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,130
which it sounds like is most relevant

103
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,930
to the audience here today.

104
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,150
The first is collecting an inventory.

105
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,430
So we need to know what
is in your environment

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,260
and how is it being used.

107
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,330
That visibility is crucial

108
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,310
because cloud optimization
is all about running

109
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,650
as lean as possible, as
many of you will know,

110
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,360
and we can't optimize what we can't see,

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,060
so the OLA starts with
that baseline inventory

112
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,560
of understanding what you
have in the environment.

113
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,730
Next, we assess the
business case for the cloud

114
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,250
or we assess how you can
optimize your existing footprint

115
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,080
that is already running in AWS.

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,930
So we will review your
environment to understand

117
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,450
if rehosting, replatforming,
or refactoring

118
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,360
is the right approach,
show you costing options

119
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,400
for each of those, and along the way,

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,780
we'll show you how you can optimize

121
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,630
both your compute and your licensing.

122
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,380
All right, so for customers
who are considering

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,700
a new migration to the cloud,

124
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,130
the OLA data also serves
as the building blocks

125
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,600
for helping you plan the journey.

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
So a lot of times we are...

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,860
You're working with a
partner on the assessment,

128
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,230
sometimes you're working
with the AWS account team,

129
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,230
and this data just helps them
dive deeper to understand

130
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,580
what your priorities are,

131
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,550
what your timelines are around migration,

132
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,550
and importantly, this program
also helps qualify you

133
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,163
for different AWS programs and incentives.

134
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,460
All right, what is the
impact of OLA in numbers?

135
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,410
So first off, as Christine mentioned,

136
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,450
the OLA comes at no cost to customers.

137
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,690
This is an investment that AWS
makes in setting customers up

138
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,870
for success as they
migrate and post migration

139
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,383
for those of you who are
already running in AWS.

140
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,890
Next, we see that customers that perform

141
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,470
one of these exercises and
take the recommendations

142
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,223
that are surfaced in the OLA
achieve a 36% cost reduction.

143
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,510
Finally, migrations are about 34% faster

144
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,570
when you're executing the
migration based on real data

145
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,953
instead of guesswork.

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,540
All right, so we will zoom in a little bit

147
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,820
on the Microsoft side of the assessment.

148
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,360
So what will you get from the
Microsoft licensing analysis

149
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,740
that is a part of an OLA, you know,

150
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,783
that's why most of you are here today.

151
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,530
When customers are considering a migration

152
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,943
of their Microsoft workloads to AWS,

153
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:33,390
they come to us with five
key questions normally,

154
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,790
and OLA has the answers for those.

155
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,257
The first is, what does my Windows

156
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,690
and SQL Server footprint look like?

157
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,980
So that goes back to collecting

158
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,110
that baseline inventory as the first step.

159
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,120
And we'll talk about
process-wise a little bit,

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,523
what that looks like
on the following slide.

161
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,690
Next is, how can I reduce my SQL cores?

162
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,850
So we see that the
majority of our customers

163
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,150
spend on Microsoft products
is typically on SQL Server,

164
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,000
especially in terms of what
gets migrated to the cloud.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,950
So that is top of mind product

166
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,593
when customers are thinking
about cost optimization.

167
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,830
Next, can I bring my own
licenses to AWS or BYOL?

168
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,920
Most of you will be familiar
with that terminology.

169
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,350
The good news is the
answer is typically yes,

170
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,480
there are, of course,
nuances and that's exactly

171
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,280
what the OLA will help you navigate.

172
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,660
Even if you can bring
your Microsoft licenses

173
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,280
to AWS, should you?

174
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,430
And today, we're gonna be
talking about an exciting feature

175
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,560
that is released for
License Included workloads

176
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,460
that can help reduce
that spend versus BYOL.

177
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,110
So in the future, we actually do think

178
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,870
that License Included options will become

179
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,820
more cost competitive for customers,

180
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,293
so stay tuned for that.

181
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,330
And finally, how do I optimize
my Enterprise Agreement,

182
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,930
my EA renewal with Microsoft as I migrate?

183
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,260
So if you can execute one
of these assessments shortly

184
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,050
before your EA renewal,
that's really the prime time

185
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,920
to do it because then you can
actually realize the savings

186
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,810
that will surface to you in the OLA.

187
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,510
As many of you will know, this
is usually a three-year term,

188
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,270
so if you can do this exercise
in preparation for that,

189
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,070
you'll avoid that lock-in

190
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,140
or be able to choose more flexible options

191
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,173
when you do renew with Microsoft.

192
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,940
All right, so tying it back
to that first question,

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,187
how do we collect an
inventory of your Windows

194
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:25,380
and SQL Server footprint?

195
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,350
OLA can support you in two ways for this.

196
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,570
If you have a tool on
premise that already has

197
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,630
an inventory of your
environment, has limited gaps,

198
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,390
it has your SQL inventory,
you can supply that to us

199
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,280
instead of installing a tool,

200
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,423
which sometimes takes some time,

201
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:42,390
and we'll clean it, consolidate it,

202
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,113
and analyze it for you, turn
it into an AWS business case.

203
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,400
If you don't have a tool on
premise with high coverage

204
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,601
or you just wanna get a fresh dataset,

205
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,990
AWS, this is part of the
investment that we make

206
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,230
in the OLA program, we'll
fund a discovery tool for you

207
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,910
to collect the information.

208
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,150
So there are a few tools
that we use for this process.

209
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,340
You may be familiar with
some of these names.

210
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,600
This isn't the full tool set,

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,060
but it's what we use on the
majority of engagements.

212
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,330
We have our first-party AWS
Migration Evaluator tool

213
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,070
and two third-parties named
Cloudamize and modelizeIT.

214
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,630
In terms of the information that we get

215
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,720
from Microsoft workloads, you're
going to get the additions

216
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,590
and the versions of your Windows
and SQL Server deployments.

217
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,360
We'll get information on
how those are utilized.

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,390
So the CPU memory storage utilization,

219
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,090
and then the instances and
databases that are running.

220
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,997
And the purpose of this is
just to inform the Windows

221
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:39,090
and SQL Server optimization
analysis that we'll walk you

222
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,640
through on the following slide.

223
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,970
All right, let's get to the good stuff.

224
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,740
This is a sample OLA output

225
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,930
from a recent customer engagement,

226
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,020
and this was an existing customer in AWS,

227
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,580
I think it will resonate with the audience

228
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,843
that we have here today.

229
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,770
This customer was a
large healthcare customer

230
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,190
with $16.5 million of EC2 spend.

231
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,130
So the first optimization
that we are going to surface

232
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,040
in an OLA is right-sizing your workloads.

233
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,550
So this is the basic level
one version of optimization

234
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,910
where you are just running the
most cost effective instance

235
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,763
that meets your performance needs.

236
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:19,800
AWS has a variety of
different instance families,

237
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,810
and so a lot of times, you're running one

238
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,660
that doesn't perfectly
suit whether that workload

239
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,450
is compute memory or storage intensive,

240
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,633
and just switching the
family can reduce your costs.

241
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,470
In this case, right-sizing
just their Linux EC2 workloads

242
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,460
save them about 12%.

243
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,990
This is savings opportunity,

244
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,590
so perhaps they execute on 50% of those,

245
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,473
but still pretty meaningful
savings at $1 million.

246
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,240
The next optimizations are
specific to Windows EC2

247
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,720
and SQL EC2 workloads,

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,460
and this is what we're gonna dive deeper

249
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,580
into with Christine and GP
later in the presentation,

250
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,860
so I won't harp on it too much.

251
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,730
But an exciting new feature
that allows you to tailor

252
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,710
the number of vCPUs that you have

253
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,620
on your Windows and SQL
License Included instances,

254
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,381
as many of you will know,

255
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,940
those licensing models are core based,

256
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,190
so anytime you're
reducing the core counts,

257
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,020
you're gonna reduce your licensing costs,

258
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,200
and this actually comes
directly off of your AWS bill.

259
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,920
So if you're purchasing Windows
or SQL licensing from AWS,

260
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,540
which most of you will be,

261
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,930
this will reflect a
reduction on your AWS spend.

262
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,350
In this case, it was a
13% additional savings,

263
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,630
so another $2 million that...

264
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,400
Before this launch wasn't even possible.

265
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,150
This is an incremental strategy
that is really gonna make

266
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,683
some important savings
changes for our customers.

267
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,880
And finally, the template.

268
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,670
The standard output that
you're gonna get for SQL,

269
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,190
the additional optimization strategy

270
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,870
is identifying SQL workloads

271
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,880
that look like they're non-prod.

272
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,950
Microsoft has a free edition of SQL Server

273
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,740
called Developer edition,
and so during the OLA,

274
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,950
we'll flag instances that
look like they are non-prod

275
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,450
based on their naming convention.

276
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,910
So dev, test, QA, et cetera.

277
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,550
We'll summarize the cores
that are running on those,

278
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,680
show you what you're likely spending

279
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,350
on your Microsoft contracts
for those non-prod cores,

280
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,210
so you can make an informed decision

281
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,180
about whether you should
downgrade to that Free edition

282
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,542
of Microsoft SQL Server
called Developer edition.

283
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:30,480
In this case, it was an
incremental 2% savings,

284
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,220
so a little bit lighter
than the other savings,

285
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,470
but sometimes this is the easiest one

286
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,263
for customers to execute, so
it's still pretty helpful.

287
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,850
Awesome, so cumulatively this was

288
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,580
a $5 million savings
opportunity for the customer

289
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,400
and they were very
pleased because for them,

290
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,260
even if they only achieved
25% of these savings,

291
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,440
it would still be over $1
million, which meant...

292
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Was a meaningful cost reduction

293
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,193
and a reinvestment opportunity for them.

294
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,960
All right, wrapping up this section.

295
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
So the final question
that we usually address

296
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,770
in an OLA is how do I optimize

297
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,200
my Microsoft Enterprise Agreement renewal?

298
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,560
Again, we highly encourage
doing one of these exercises

299
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,470
six months to one year in
advance of your EA renewal,

300
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,170
so you can go into that conversation

301
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,880
with the insights from the OLA,

302
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,120
especially if you're seriously
considering a cloud migration

303
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,070
within the next year as well.

304
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,740
Is anybody coming up on
their Microsoft EA renewal

305
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,673
in the next year?

306
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,860
Anyone know?

307
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,880
We don't know.

308
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,780
Not procurement people it sounds like.

309
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,400
All right, well, there
are some standard insights

310
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,560
that will surface as
a part of this process

311
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,110
and then we have experts
who can dive deeper,

312
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,950
look at your unique contracts
if you are interested

313
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,900
in that type of tailored analysis.

314
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,080
But the first one is, for Windows Server,

315
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,380
most customers are gonna
migrate to shared tenancy in AWS

316
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,020
and that comes with the
Windows License Included.

317
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,080
So our standard recommendation
is to avoid double payment,

318
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,360
you should discontinue
the payments that you make

319
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,820
to Microsoft annually for
Windows Software Assurance

320
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,353
to reduce your net costs.

321
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,650
For SQL Server, we encourage
customers to switch

322
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,320
from perpetual licensing to subscription

323
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,230
in certain scenarios, this is
not right for every customer.

324
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,310
But if you know that
you will be optimizing

325
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,950
your cores further after migration,

326
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,980
but you don't have time to
do it before your EA renewal,

327
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,640
a good option can be to switch
to subscription licensing

328
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,220
so you have the flexibility
to true-down sooner.

329
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,050
EA is a three-year lock in

330
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,510
unless you do that subscription licensing,

331
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,890
which would give you more flexibility

332
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,360
to true-down after a year.

333
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,530
So it's something to consider

334
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,780
if you know you're gonna optimize,

335
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,523
but you can't do it immediately.

336
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,980
Next, and again, this is gonna tie to GP's

337
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,330
and Christine's presentation

338
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,850
on Optimize CPU for
License Included workloads,

339
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,420
but evaluating whether License
Included is a better option

340
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,580
for you than Bring-Your-Own-License.

341
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,640
Outside of it becoming
more cost competitive

342
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,590
with this new feature, a lot of customers

343
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,593
just prefer not to manage
licensing with Microsoft.

344
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,620
Makes sense, rightfully so.

345
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,110
So you can outsource that to AWS

346
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,570
and we manage the licensing
payments to Microsoft

347
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,043
when you go License Included.

348
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,680
And finally, this is not specific,

349
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,900
we talked a little bit about
addition downgrades before.

350
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,070
This is more associated with
your production workloads.

351
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,720
So if you have production workloads

352
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,840
that are running Enterprise
edition software,

353
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,450
a lot of times, you're not
using the Enterprise features

354
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,910
and it's actually less expensive

355
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,820
to buy new perpetual standard licenses

356
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,280
than just to renew the
annual maintenance payments

357
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,020
on Enterprise Edition.

358
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,730
Enterprise is about four times more

359
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,070
as expensive as Standard.

360
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,860
So that's another thing
that you can consider.

361
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,870
Assess whether you're
actually using the features

362
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,150
and if not, it might be a good opportunity

363
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,800
just to make the change, bite the bullet,

364
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
and downgrade to a Standard edition.

365
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,370
Awesome, so these are the
standard recommendations

366
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,500
that you will get in an OLA output.

367
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,230
But behind every OLA, we have
a team of licensing experts

368
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,690
like myself, like GP, like Christine,

369
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,760
who you can tap into
if you have more custom

370
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,220
or specific asks, and they can also answer

371
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,830
follow-up questions on
the licensing insights

372
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,823
that we present.

373
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,080
Christine is the expert
in Microsoft licensing,

374
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,270
she's our go-to, so
I'll pass it over to her

375
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,240
to give more detailed
insights on how to optimize

376
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,340
and manage in the cloud.

377
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,530
- Thank you so much, Valerie.

378
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,030
All right, so now, I'm gonna go over a bit

379
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,040
of licensing information for you.

380
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,540
I'll start with Bring-Your-Own-License

381
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,283
and how that works on AWS.

382
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,250
So I mentioned earlier,
it looks like a lot of you

383
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,070
maybe are already familiar
with License Mobility benefits,

384
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,840
but if you're not familiar,

385
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,550
this is a Software Assurance benefit

386
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,890
that allows you to bring
your eligible products

387
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,850
to a shared tenancy
environment such as EC2 on AWS.

388
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,030
To qualify, the product
itself must be eligible

389
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,980
for License Mobility benefits.

390
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,390
So it's not necessarily enough

391
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,740
that there's Software Assurance,

392
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,810
the product also must be eligible,

393
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,040
and again, the Software Assurance

394
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,740
and eligible subscriptions are required,

395
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,290
and this can be deployed on
shared or dedicated tenancy,

396
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,240
it doesn't have to be shared.

397
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,970
And there is a License Mobility
verification form as well

398
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,243
that you are to fill out up
to 10 days after deployment.

399
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,600
For some products that are eligible

400
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,160
for License Mobility benefits,

401
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,850
we have Azure DevOps, Exchange
Server, Project Server,

402
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,430
SharePoint Server, SQL Server, of course,

403
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,050
System Center Server,
and there's some others

404
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,900
in there as well.

405
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,267
So just to dive in a bit
more into SQL Server BYOL,

406
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:48,093
'cause it is a very popular
product for customers to bring.

407
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,180
If we're looking at the core model,

408
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,700
one core license is gonna cover one vCPU

409
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,143
on shared tenant EC2.

410
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,160
There is a four core licensing
minimum set by Microsoft.

411
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,980
So you could potentially
deploy on an instance

412
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,270
smaller than four vCPUs,

413
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,800
but you would still need to assign

414
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,203
four cores of licensing as a minimum.

415
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,593
Again, Software Assurance is required,

416
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,370
and if we look here at this chart of...

417
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,020
The r7a instance family,

418
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,020
you'll see the r7a.large
does have two vCPUs,

419
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,850
but again, you would assign four cores

420
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,520
just because of that four
core licensing minimum.

421
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,640
If you were to deploy on
the r7a.24xlarge instance,

422
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,503
you'd bring 96 cores of SQL.

423
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,190
Now, for the server CAL model,

424
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,200
we don't come across this as often,

425
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,640
but it is definitely something

426
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,530
that some customers do still have,

427
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,660
for specific use cases.

428
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,670
Here you're just gonna
have one server license

429
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,833
per EC2 instance or per VM,

430
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,030
plus you'll have the
additional user or Device CALs

431
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,550
for all users or devices that have access,

432
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,713
and that's direct or indirect access.

433
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,200
You'll also need the Software Assurance

434
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,870
or eligible subscriptions
on the server licenses

435
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,403
and also the the CALs.

436
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,460
Again, just a reminder

437
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,060
that License Mobility
verification form is required.

438
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,210
A bit more on BYOL for SQL Server,

439
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,940
there is a passive failover
benefit available for customers

440
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,110
that are bringing their licenses

441
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,120
with their Software Assurance.

442
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,670
Again, this is a Software
Assurance benefit

443
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,920
and it is one-to-one, so
it does work differently

444
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,530
than maybe what you can do on-premises.

445
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,753
So that is a key note to consider.

446
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,830
So one SQL Server EC2
instance, for example,

447
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,630
allows you to deploy a secondary
passive SQL Server instance

448
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,373
of the same size or
smaller in terms of vCPUs.

449
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,050
This is not eligible for
active-active configurations.

450
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,810
If we look at this example
here, two R5 instances,

451
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,330
eight vCPUs each, the
passive instance doesn't need

452
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,710
to be licensed for SQL,

453
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,890
but the active instance
would be licensed for SQL.

454
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,590
So overall, eight cores of
SQL Server licensing required

455
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,740
for this configuration.

456
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,810
Now, for non-production,
Val touched on this already,

457
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,678
but SQL Server Developer
edition is free for you to bring

458
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:04,863
for non-production workloads,
so it is a BYOL scenario.

459
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,630
And with the release of SQL
Server 2025 just the other day,

460
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,610
not sure if you saw that, but there is now

461
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,220
two Developer editions
available for that version.

462
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,070
One for Enterprise edition,
one for Standard edition,

463
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,150
which is great for those of you

464
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,650
that are only looking to deploy.

465
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,350
In Standard edition, once
you move to production,

466
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,139
you can use that Standard
edition, Developer edition.

467
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:30,750
For anyone deploying SQL Server
2022 or earlier versions,

468
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,000
you'd still use the Standard...

469
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,980
Developer edition that covers all features

470
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,393
up to Enterprise edition.

471
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,710
And as a reminder to use
this Developer edition,

472
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,680
you cannot be connected
to a production database

473
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,143
or it can't be used for DR as well.

474
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,440
And it does include all the same features

475
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,240
as Enterprise edition except, of course,

476
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,820
where you're using the new 2025 version

477
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,520
that does have a Standard edition.

478
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,327
And as with any BYOL on AWS,

479
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,490
you are required to bring
your own media or install

480
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,313
for the products that you're bringing.

481
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,360
Now, I'm gonna shift
gears to bringing products

482
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,583
that do not have License
Mobility benefits.

483
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,560
There was some changes that were made

484
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,980
effective October 1st 2019.

485
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,770
These were changes
specifically impacted products

486
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,650
that are not eligible for
License Mobility benefits.

487
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,910
So this does not impact

488
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,103
anything I've just
spoken about previously.

489
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,430
To bring a product that is not eligible

490
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,906
for License Mobility benefits,
such as Windows Server,

491
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:35,100
the version you're deploying
first must be a version

492
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,890
that was released before October 1st 2019.

493
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,240
For Windows Server, that's
version 2019 or earlier only.

494
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,273
You must also have perpetual
licenses, not subscription.

495
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,120
And the licenses must have
been originally purchased

496
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,280
before October 1st 2019

497
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,020
or originally purchased within an EA term

498
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,350
that started before October 1st 2019.

499
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,750
So again, this impacted
products only not eligible

500
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,450
for License Mobility benefits,
that would be Windows Server,

501
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,643
Visual Studio, and Office applications.

502
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,960
SQL Server without Software
Assurance would also not have

503
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
License Mobility benefits, so
that would also be impacted

504
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,007
if you did not have Software
Assurance on your SQL.

505
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,210
Just to dive a bit more
into Windows Server BYOL,

506
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,963
as it does come up quite often.

507
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,110
If you have those eligible licenses

508
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,420
and you're deploying
version 2019 or earlier,

509
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,680
you would use dedicated
hosts and you would license

510
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,080
the total number of
physical cores of the hosts.

511
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,660
So if you're looking at
an R5 EC2 dedicated host,

512
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,570
for example, that has 48 physical cores,

513
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,330
you'd license 48 cores
Windows Server Datacenter,

514
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,630
and you'd be covered for
any number of R5 instances

515
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,130
that you can fit on that host.

516
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,940
This also is true for our
recently launched service,

517
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,610
Amazon EVS or Elastic VMware Service.

518
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,530
It is running on dedicated,
so it does allow you

519
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,830
to bring your Windows
Server licenses as well.

520
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,580
Again, Software Assurance is not required

521
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,720
for bringing Windows Server

522
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,090
because it doesn't have
License Mobility benefits.

523
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,710
So whether you're using BYOL

524
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,020
or you're moving to a
License Included model,

525
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,400
as Valerie mentioned, that's a great way

526
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
to reduce costs at your next renewal,

527
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,210
is to lower that Software Assurance

528
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,743
as you won't be needing it.

529
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,240
Now, for License Included

530
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,370
and some of the offerings we have there.

531
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,960
For Windows Server License Included,

532
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,640
this is most commonly used by customers

533
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,240
because it does allow customers
to deploy on shared EC2.

534
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,620
It covers any addition.

535
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,540
We don't always list an addition,

536
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,750
but our licensing agreement
with Microsoft is very specific,

537
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,183
very customized, and
it covers any addition.

538
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,280
It also includes unlimited
Windows Server CALs,

539
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,710
as well as two remote
desktop services connections

540
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,503
for each EC2 instance that
using License Included.

541
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,250
And again, this is a
required licensing option

542
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,393
on shared EC2.

543
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,190
It's also required for
versions 2022 and 2025

544
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,110
of Windows Server, and
that's because those versions

545
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,933
were released after the
October 1st 2019 changes.

546
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,250
These Windows Server License Included

547
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,283
is billed per vCPU per second
for on-demand instances.

548
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,480
It is an option that can
be used for external use.

549
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,840
So for example, if you are
an ISV or a SaaS provider

550
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,570
that was impacted by the SPLA BYOL changes

551
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,870
where Microsoft no longer
allows SPLA BYOL on AWS,

552
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,323
License Included is a compatible
option for those workloads.

553
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,860
And if you need additional

554
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,750
remote desktop services connections,

555
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,180
we do offer those as License Included.

556
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,050
But you can also BYOL or
bring your own RDS User CALs

557
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,950
with Software Assurance through
License Mobility benefits.

558
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,190
Now, for License Included SQL Server.

559
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,290
We offer this in the core model only,

560
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,300
so there's no CALs required.

561
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,150
We offer this in Standard,
Enterprise, and Web edition.

562
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,760
Again, with the release of SQL 2025,

563
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,620
there is no new Web edition available.

564
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,800
So 2022 Web edition is
the last edition available

565
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,900
and it is a very specific use case.

566
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
So Web edition can only be used

567
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,530
for publicly accessible websites.

568
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,240
If you're not familiar with that edition,

569
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,280
that probably means you can't use it,

570
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,103
but it is something that
we do offer for up to 2022.

571
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,200
All right, so this is also
billed per vCPU per second

572
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,640
for on-demand instances,

573
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,500
and it can also be used for external use.

574
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,920
So again, if you're an
ISV or a SaaS provider,

575
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,613
this option also replaces the
SPLA BYOL that was removed.

576
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,993
All right, so now,

577
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:32,190
onto some licensing
optimization recommendations

578
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,840
and best practices.

579
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
So we do have a free tool
called AWS License Manager.

580
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,300
This is a great tool to use

581
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,520
to input your licenses
that you're bringing.

582
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,740
It can also be used to take a look

583
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,630
at your License Included instances.

584
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,090
This is a great way to keep
track of what you're using.

585
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,470
You can use it also to integrate

586
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,420
with dedicated hosts and other services.

587
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,370
So I highly recommend checking this out,

588
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,573
if you haven't already.

589
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,010
It can be used with a variety
of different software.

590
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,120
It doesn't have to be Microsoft,

591
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,490
there's a lot of different
vendors that it supports,

592
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,740
and you can use it even for on-premises,

593
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,690
or workloads, and other clouds as well.

594
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,480
This is just a view of what it looks like

595
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,520
when you're inputting some licenses.

596
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,900
and you can choose whether you want

597
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,760
to enforce a license limit

598
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,990
or don't have it in
force where you just get

599
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,280
a warning message if you
go over your licensing.

600
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,580
If you are interested in
learning more about this tool,

601
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm also speaking at a
second session on Thursday

602
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,770
called MAM321: Licensing
management and optimization

603
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,100
where we are gonna speak about
some new licensing features

604
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,080
through License Manager.

605
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,080
That's on Thursday, December
4th at the MGM Grand.

606
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,220
This QR code will take
you to the catalogs,

607
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,933
you can see where that's located.

608
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,090
All right, instance right-sizing.

609
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,640
As Valerie mentioned,
this is a core component

610
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,710
of our OLA offerings.

611
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,560
This can benefit License Included.

612
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,240
Our products are licensed per vCPU

613
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,890
for Windows Server and SQL Server,

614
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,320
so the more you're right-sized
on the instance size,

615
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,220
the more your licensing costs
will be right-sized as well.

616
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,290
For BYOL, this is also beneficial

617
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,760
because SQL licensing for
BYOL is licensed per vCPU

618
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,530
if you're bringing core licenses,

619
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,040
and again, right-sizing is
gonna optimize your licensing

620
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,740
that you're bringing over as well.

621
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,160
On the Windows Server side,
this can help in both ways.

622
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,140
BYOL, if you're right-sizing,

623
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,580
you can end up with fewer hosts,

624
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,920
which means lower infrastructure costs

625
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,323
and lower licensing costs as well.

626
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,700
And again, OLA, so that's
gonna help you figure

627
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,800
all of this stuff out.

628
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,400
Now, for a new feature that
we just recently launched,

629
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,760
Amazon EC2 High
Availability for SQL Server.

630
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,590
This is a new feature available

631
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,620
for License Included SQL
Server that now allows you

632
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,430
to not license the
passive or secondary node.

633
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,830
Previously, this was required,
you'd have to license both

634
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,570
if you were using License Included.

635
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,010
Now, if you're using License Included,

636
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,440
you will be exempt from the
SQL License Included costs

637
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,063
on that secondary passive node.

638
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,500
So this supports two EC2 instances

639
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,720
per SQL Server High Availability cluster.

640
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,520
It supports always on availability groups,

641
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,460
as well as failover cluster instances.

642
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,130
You only pay for the Windows
Server License Included costs

643
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,900
on the passive nodes,

644
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
as well as the compute costs, of course.

645
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,810
The passive SQL Server instance
needs to be the same size

646
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,693
or smaller than the active
SQL Server instance.

647
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,830
And this is available for
new and existing instances.

648
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,500
So you can go into the console
to update your instances

649
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,790
if you have these already

650
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,923
or you can use this for new deployments.

651
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,170
It does require AWS Systems
Manager Agent to be installed

652
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,470
and running on the
instances for this to work.

653
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,803
If you wanna learn more,

654
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:53,730
we do have this QR code here as well.

655
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,320
We have lots of documentation for you

656
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,260
including a blog that's
been released as well,

657
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,493
so check that out.

658
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,440
And for another new feature
that has been recently launched,

659
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,620
and this is gonna be spoken
about a lot in our session,

660
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,900
GP's gonna take over for me shortly,

661
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,600
but this is Optimize CPU
for License Included.

662
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,540
So previously to this
launch, customers could use

663
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,720
Optimize CPU to lower their
number of vCPUs on an instance,

664
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,110
which would let them bring
fewer SQL Core licenses.

665
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,660
This now is available for
License Included as well.

666
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,110
And it not only impacts SQL
Server License Included,

667
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,710
but it also impacts Windows
Server License Included.

668
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,510
So this is gonna be a
great way for customers

669
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,280
who for the most part have to use

670
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,860
Windows Server License
Included on shared EC2

671
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,020
if there's room for optimization there,

672
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,570
and to either disable hyper-threading

673
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,570
or use a specific number of vCPUs,

674
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,660
this will immediately lower
your License Included costs

675
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,763
for Windows Server, as well as SQL Server.

676
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,360
Using this feature, you
will see a separate billing

677
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,070
for licensing, so it will be broken out

678
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,950
of your EC2 instance costs, which is new.

679
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,870
Typically, without using this feature,

680
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,190
your License Included costs will be

681
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,780
within your compute costs.

682
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,240
This feature will separate those.

683
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,303
And again, this is available
for new and existing instances.

684
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,367
So great news here, here's just an example

685
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,450
of the x1e family type.

686
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,300
You can see the max vCPUs
is the default vCPUs,

687
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,830
the instance size comes with.

688
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,120
You can turn these down all the way

689
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,920
to the examples shown here.

690
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,590
But just a reminder, SQL Server licensing

691
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,590
is a four core minimum
even for License Included,

692
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,840
so we wouldn't necessarily recommend going

693
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,480
all the way down anyways, but
if you were to go below four,

694
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,363
you'd still see license
costs for four cores.

695
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,080
All right, so that's it for me,

696
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,530
I'm gonna hand it over to GP.

697
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,883
- Thank you.

698
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,920
So my name is GianPaolo Albanese,

699
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,380
I'm a Solutions Architect Specialist.

700
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,570
Been at AWS for eight years.

701
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,580
The one thing that I got
from the session so far

702
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,610
is that I have really
trouble sleeping at night.

703
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,370
So if you wanna fall asleep very quickly,

704
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,240
you can read about the licensing
that Microsoft provides.

705
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,970
I will appreciate actually
Polly, Amazon Polly,

706
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,220
to actually read it to me
very slowly and softly,

707
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,370
and you fall asleep right
away, or you can go to a bar.

708
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,860
But this is probably works best.

709
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,620
So let's move in and
talk about a little bit

710
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,533
about Optimize CPU and SQL Server.

711
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,610
So why is this important?

712
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,610
So SQL Server licensing
is based on active CPUs

713
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,930
that are visible to the operating systems.

714
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,180
And so what we are seeing more and more

715
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,960
is that customers need to
deploy larger EC2 instance sizes

716
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,790
because they have specific requirement,

717
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,850
either IOPS requirements
or memory requirements.

718
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,630
And so therefore, if you
want a 512 gigs of RAM

719
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,200
allocated to your instance,
you have to deploy

720
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,593
maybe an r6idn.16xlarge.

721
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,820
It's a lot of money, right?

722
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,800
And again, there is gold, right?

723
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,210
There's gold coins in there.

724
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,180
So every time you basically
spin one of these machines up

725
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,913
just to accommodate one of your workloads,

726
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,197
again, it's a huge cost
that happens on licensing.

727
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:14,515
And so again, what we're
trying to do is we're trying

728
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,803
to kind of minimize the cost.

729
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,990
So what can we do?

730
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,111
As already Valerie and
Christine mentioned,

731
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:25,887
we do have a new feature,
it's Optimize CPU.

732
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:30,810
And what Optimize CPU would
allow us to do is it allows you

733
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,670
to actually modify the
instance type after launch.

734
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,070
So what you can do is
after you start analyzing

735
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,320
your workload and trying
to figure out exactly

736
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,100
what really works or what
is the perfect balance

737
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,970
between CPU memory and storage,

738
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,400
then at that point you can
actually stop the instance

739
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,220
and start making some
modification to the instance.

740
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,617
In fact, some of the
things that you can do

741
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:57,270
or how this feature works

742
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,080
is that after you accept
the default instance

743
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,730
that you have deployed,

744
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,210
you can go back and you can
start working on disabling

745
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,360
the hyper-threading on the CPU.

746
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,145
So you allow now to modify that
after you stop the instance.

747
00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:15,390
And what we notice that most of the times,

748
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,620
when you're dealing with high
performance compute workloads

749
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,960
or maybe someday it's dealing

750
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,450
with the scientific calculations,

751
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,060
disabling hyper-threading
actually helps a lot, right?

752
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,390
You see an improvement because
there is no context switching

753
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,700
with the operating systems.

754
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,080
And so at this point, what you can do

755
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,480
is you can also now go even further.

756
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,830
After you disable the hyper-threading,

757
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,600
you start analyzing your workload,

758
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,687
now, you can go back and say,

759
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:44,220
"Maybe I can actually
also trim down the CPUs.

760
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,200
I don't have to dedicate four
CPUs for my Windows Server,

761
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,840
maybe I can go for two," if
you're not running SQL Server.

762
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,690
Remember, SQL Server requires four CPUs,

763
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,370
there is no way around that.

764
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,910
So that's another way that
you can kind of reduce cost.

765
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,710
So what are some of the key benefits

766
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,390
that some of our customers seeing?

767
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,210
First of all, you start seeing a reduction

768
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,340
on your SQL Server cost,

769
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,310
especially with you
Bring-Your-Own-License into AWS,

770
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,900
and there is a new feature coming up

771
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,190
where this will available also

772
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,730
for License Included on SQL Server.

773
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,390
But what I also know, there's
a lot of commercial software,

774
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,120
they have specific
requirements that are many CPUs

775
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,730
you need to run to be compliant.

776
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,610
Especially if you have
like a third-party support

777
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,750
and you need to open up a case,

778
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,580
you wanna make sure that
you follow the guidelines

779
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,170
from the third-party vendor

780
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,533
or the the CALs application requirements.

781
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,540
Something else that you
can see is we seen...

782
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,020
Some customers seeing some
really performance improvements

783
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,060
when they disable the hyper-threading

784
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,410
on some of the workloads.

785
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,850
Again, you need to test that out,

786
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,250
and we do have CloudWatch and CloudMetrix

787
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,600
that you can kind of collect

788
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,020
or if you have your own collection agents,

789
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,210
you can kind of start
collecting this information

790
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,800
and analyze it often.

791
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,730
And again, we have another
exciting tool that we can use

792
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,760
to actually help you go
through and figure out exactly

793
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,073
what is working for your
particular workload.

794
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,110
And so we this, see some
customers now improving

795
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,430
and having performance improvement

796
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,135
just by disabling hyper-threading.

797
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:21,390
And also what they (indistinct) is another

798
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,570
is a lower infrastructure
cost, and that's key,

799
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,390
because, again, AWS is
a little differentiator

800
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,310
with other cloud providers you might see.

801
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,890
We always try to help
customers save costs, right?

802
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,860
We provide you the tools
to analyze your workload

803
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,070
and then you can work with any one of us,

804
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,350
a solutions architect or specialist,

805
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,180
to kind of help you kind of figure out

806
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,070
where can we kind of trim things

807
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,270
or kind of lower the trial a little bit

808
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,013
so that you can save some money.

809
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,340
So what are some of the best practices,

810
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,840
specifically when you're dealing
with SQL CPU optimization?

811
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,610
Well, there's some things
that you really need

812
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,850
to be careful and be watching out for.

813
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,800
So first things that we noticed

814
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,410
is that once you disable
the hyper-threading

815
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,550
on SQL Server specifically,
we don't see any major impact

816
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,620
on performance on the machine.

817
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,337
In fact, that's a quick win,
right, for saving money.

818
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,980
And the beauty of this is that we...

819
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,940
Especially if you're dealing

820
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,670
with online transactional processing,

821
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,860
actually benefits the operating system

822
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,283
and the server actually runs
much better and by performing.

823
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,180
The next steps, so with the first steps

824
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,100
you see almost 35% on cost.

825
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,860
But if you go to the next
steps and now start looking

826
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,620
and monitoring your environment even more,

827
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,320
you start realizing maybe
you can kind of throttle down

828
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,550
even the core count.

829
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,850
And if you do this, you
can actually achieve

830
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,500
a 47% cost savings without
impacting your workload.

831
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,120
Now, I wanna be extremely careful there.

832
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,420
You have to continuously
test the environment

833
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,220
and collect metrics to make sure

834
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,290
that you're actually
achieving those goals.

835
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,660
Because sometimes what's
happening is you might have

836
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,110
certain processes or certain systems

837
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,970
that at the end of the month
are very transactional,

838
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,330
they're running some
big batch jobs, right?

839
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,800
And you wanna minimize any
impact on your performance.

840
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,060
And the other thing I wanna mention is,

841
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,060
actually you need to monitor, you know,

842
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,340
the IOPS and CPU ratio.

843
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,340
So we found like a sweet spot,
7,000 to 8,000 IOPS per CPU

844
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,860
is the sweet spot where you can get

845
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,930
actually good performance,

846
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,810
and also there is a
cost savings associated.

847
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,810
If you start deviating from
this IOPS requirement per CPU,

848
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,540
if you go to high, you
have system contention.

849
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,270
'Cause what happens is
now the IOPS are very high

850
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,920
and what's happening in the subsystem

851
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,470
is actually working very, very hard.

852
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,470
So now, the storage IOPS system
is actually being impacted.

853
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,310
If you go the other way around

854
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,230
where you travel down the IOPS,

855
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,690
now, you're seeing that
you CPU is actually idling

856
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,770
and it's not doing anything,

857
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,140
it's waiting for the
system to provide data.

858
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,400
So again, testing is key
and you want to kind of

859
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,380
don't want to go...

860
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,650
You wanna kind of stay or monitor the IOPS

861
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,273
for your environment.

862
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,760
And lastly, test, test, test.

863
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,260
You have to test your workload,

864
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,540
test with load, with no load,

865
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,836
test over the weekend nights,

866
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:35,583
you know, Black Friday, just test it.

867
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,303
We have a lot of tools
that we can provide you.

868
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:41,490
We have CloudWatch metrics
that can basically help you

869
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,480
monitor all these things.

870
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,150
You can also set alerts as well

871
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,900
or you can create an SNS
topic and send the information

872
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,883
to your email or to a dashboard.

873
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,120
So now, it's part of the demo.

874
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,550
So how do you do this?

875
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,587
So let me just switch over to my screen,

876
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,443
and if everything works
well, there you go.

877
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,973
So you have your Console here, right?

878
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,913
Don't look at my bill.

879
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,460
This thing is bothering me.

880
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,293
There we go.

881
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,173
So a bunch of instances
running on my system, right?

882
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,810
And right now, I'm just gonna second guess

883
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,160
and see what's happening, right?

884
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,770
I have no metrics, but let's
say that I have this SQL Server

885
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,913
that I'm running on m5.xlarge, right?

886
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,050
And right now, if you look
at the instance, right,

887
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,880
if you don't know anything about m5.large,

888
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,431
you can actually see how many CPUs

889
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,753
are allocated to the system.

890
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:56,836
(GP hums)

891
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,898
Oh, sorry, that's the guy.

892
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,903
There we go.

893
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,870
All right, once you look at the details,

894
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,750
you go on the bottom,
and you can actually see

895
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:20,220
some information about the server itself.

896
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,370
So right now, if you
can tell on the screen,

897
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,350
eight CPUs are actually allocated

898
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,180
to this virtual machine, it's by default.

899
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,130
So I deployed the SQL Server,

900
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,630
I've deployed Enterprise on it,

901
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,510
I automatically enabled eight CPUs on it.

902
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,350
But let's say that you wanna

903
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,850
actually now start streaming down

904
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,980
or start playing around
with the hyper-threading.

905
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,720
Well, your first thing you
have to do is you actually have

906
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,813
to stop the instance, right?

907
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,320
Now, once the instance is stopped,

908
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,755
it will take a couple
minutes, a minute or so.

909
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:51,210
We can actually go in there
and not stop playing around

910
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,403
with the hyper-threading first, right?

911
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,160
And you'll see that after you do that,

912
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,680
you can actually start
the instance up again

913
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,560
and it will actually now allocate only

914
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,290
the number of CPUs that I've...

915
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,350
Or vCPUS that I have allocated
to a particular system.

916
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,023
So let's refresh this real quick.

917
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,703
Okay.

918
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,680
All right, that's the guy.

919
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,050
So you go to Actions, you
go to Instance Settings,

920
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,400
and now, you have a new option
here that says Change CPUs.

921
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,690
Here it actually allows you

922
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,830
and it gives you a little snippet there.

923
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,620
It tells you that you
can lower your Windows

924
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,550
with SQL Server Standard
vCPU licenses, right?

925
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,650
By just playing around with these numbers.

926
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,870
The one thing that I'm gonna do

927
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,730
is I'm just gonna disable hyper-threading.

928
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,380
Right now, we have two
threads allocated per CPU

929
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,673
across my server.

930
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,730
Notice what happens.

931
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,520
First of all, you get this message

932
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,550
that if you are used to
looking at the billing

933
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,610
and the way the EC2 is actually charged,

934
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,440
usually if you do a License Included,

935
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,020
you only see one cost, right?

936
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,390
Once you actually start playing
it out with the threading

937
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,570
or a CPU course that you
enable and disabling,

938
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,460
it actually is gonna split the cost.

939
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,320
So you're gonna see two prices there.

940
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,610
One for the instance

941
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,970
and one for actually the number
of CPUs actually allocated.

942
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,370
So I'm just gonna change it.

943
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,040
The only thing you have to do after this

944
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,713
is just start the instance.

945
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,217
You give it a minute, right?

946
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:42,060
And now, you can see that the
number of vCPUs now it's four.

947
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,340
So going forward, if you
have a License Included

948
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,930
with SQL Server running on it,

949
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,500
you're gonna only pay for
the four licenses now,

950
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,820
instead of eight.

951
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,060
You can do this on every
single server across your fleet

952
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,080
and you're already gonna start
seeing some cost savings.

953
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,377
But obviously, you're gonna ask yourself,

954
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,530
"Am I gonna go through 5,000 servers

955
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,730
and start clicking on things,

956
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,220
and trying to figure out what
works, what doesn't work?"

957
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,920
Obviously you don't wanna
do that, right? (coughs)

958
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,110
So another tool that we have,

959
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,483
and I'm gonna switch
back to PowerPoint, yeah.

960
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,800
Is the AWS Compute Optimizer.

961
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,290
This is a great tool, and the reason why

962
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,010
is because it takes the
thought process figuring out

963
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,740
what work and what doesn't
work in your environment

964
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,853
to the next level.

965
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:30,720
So what is it?

966
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,400
It's actually powered by Machine Learning.

967
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,950
You're gonna hear about
AI across the board.

968
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,980
Well, this is actually a tool
that I really love to use

969
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,840
because it actually saves me a lot of time

970
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,340
when I start analyzing my environment,

971
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,560
and you will see why, right?

972
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,083
So it is powered by Machine Learning.

973
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,620
It actually analyzes historical data

974
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,783
that is being collected from your systems,

975
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,680
from CPU, memory, IOPS
consumption, and it starts

976
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,343
just tracking all these
data, right, internally.

977
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,590
It starts identify some patterns
and maybe you have missed.

978
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,170
So you run this in your
environment, you turn it,

979
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,110
literally, it's a flag that you enable,

980
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:16,713
and it starts analyzing your
environment for you, right?

981
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,480
And then what it starts doing,
it starts making predictions.

982
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,823
It starts telling you,
"Okay, you know what?

983
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,580
I see a cost savings of X
thousands of dollars a month

984
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,587
if you make these modifications."

985
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:35,737
In the past we had similar
tools, I kind of did this.

986
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:37,590
However, you only provide
you like, you know,

987
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,930
you could use Cost Explorer, right?

988
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,270
You can use AWS Budget, you
can use all these other tools.

989
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,360
I kind of combine 'em
together to give you that data

990
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,193
and then you have to figure out

991
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:48,270
what you wanna do with this data.

992
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,770
So what happens?

993
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,030
Well, as it goes through,

994
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,550
it starts looking at your EC2 instances,

995
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,920
it starts looking at
your auto scaling groups,

996
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,830
the EBS volume, the storage,
the Lambda function.

997
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,310
Now, we have also Aurora and RDS databases

998
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,650
that actually are being monitored as well,

999
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,990
and also we have ECS on
Fargate, and we are gonna have

1000
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,580
more and more services being
monitored by Compute Optimizer.

1001
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,400
Now, what happens, because it's using AI

1002
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,990
to actually do all this, right?

1003
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,250
It's all automated.

1004
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,100
Think about this.

1005
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:24,043
You have a guy working 24/7,
monitoring your environment,

1006
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,320
collecting data constantly,
then using the data,

1007
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,570
running some algorithm against it,

1008
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,843
and then trying to figure out
what will work best for you.

1009
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,040
So again, it's a predictive
cost optimizations.

1010
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,510
So you really don't have to do anything,

1011
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,250
you just have to turn on a flag.

1012
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,470
It actually looks like your performance

1013
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,880
on the subsystem as well.

1014
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,460
So if you remember before,
we had to find a sweet spot,

1015
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,730
7,000 AI, 8,000 IOPS per CPU,

1016
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,590
we don't have to do that now, right?

1017
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,330
The system will do that for you,

1018
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,350
and it also it's gonna make

1019
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,440
some data driven recommendations,
which is very cool.

1020
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,960
So I just have a quick dashboard
and then we're gonna...

1021
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,370
I'm gonna jump into my laptop again,

1022
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,200
I'll show you my environment

1023
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,180
'cause I had to collect some data first.

1024
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,710
But for example, it gives you
eh, $185 a month cost savings.

1025
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,660
Ah, not big deal, right?

1026
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,030
You click on the EC2 instance,
but you can see there

1027
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,150
on the left side all these other services

1028
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,880
that it's actually
monitoring for you, right?

1029
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,530
And again, like I mentioned before,

1030
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,600
more and more service are gonna be added.

1031
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,460
And then what it'll do is it actually make

1032
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,660
a recommendation for you.

1033
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,250
Look at all your environment,

1034
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,220
it is actually looking at your workload,

1035
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,457
and then it's gonna actually say,

1036
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,710
"Wait a minute, some of these systems

1037
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,790
are actually optimized, some
of them are over-provisioned."

1038
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,540
And then it actually tells you
what is over provision, why.

1039
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,937
In this case, CPU over provision,
EBS, IOPS over provision,

1040
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,160
and so on and so forth,

1041
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,600
because I haven't done
anything with these machines.

1042
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,720
Basically the sitting IOP,
right, running something.

1043
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,340
But if you look on the right pane,

1044
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,750
it actually gives you a
estimated monthly cost

1045
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,223
of what the cost savings are.

1046
00:47:00,128 --> 00:47:02,280
So if we go back to my screen, yep.

1047
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,470
And we do AWS Cost Optimizer,
Compute Optimizer, right?

1048
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,510
So let's look how my account looks like.

1049
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,060
Definitely over provisioned.

1050
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,770
There we go.

1051
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,120
So I have cost saving.

1052
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,340
This is just my personal account, right?

1053
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,800
I can actually save $1,000 a month.

1054
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,550
I mean AWS saves $1,000 'cause
I'm not paying for this.

1055
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:39,150
But look at this, some of the
numbers, 15% cost savings.

1056
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,010
And what I really like about this,

1057
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,143
I can click on my EC2 instances,

1058
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,520
and now, I have the
data that I need, right?

1059
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,940
It tells me that my SQL Server
Optimize CPU is optimized,

1060
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,590
but there is a bunch of other instances

1061
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,390
that are not optimized.

1062
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,830
Now, the cool thing about this

1063
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,330
is that it's actually gonna start making

1064
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:02,330
some recommendations of what
the current instance type is

1065
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,410
and what is the recommended
instance size to go to.

1066
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,390
Now, the other thing that you can also do

1067
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,480
is start using this data to instead of

1068
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,310
maybe changing instance sizes,

1069
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,820
because now, we have the Optimize
CPU that we can leverage.

1070
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,610
Go back and stop playing
around with the hyper-threading

1071
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:25,290
and, you know, and turning
off the CPUs on your system.

1072
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:28,350
So you don't necessarily, but
you can use this as a guide

1073
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,570
to kind of help you through it.

1074
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,623
Very cool stuff.

1075
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,140
So the question that you might have now

1076
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,590
is how to get started
with all of this, right?

1077
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,053
So I'm gonna give it back
to Valerie to continue.

1078
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:44,237
Thank you, Valerie.
- Awesome, thank you GP.

1079
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,080
All right, so we've just seen
the power of Optimize CPU

1080
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,090
for License Included in real life.

1081
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,830
We saw some good usage of the
AWS Compute Optimizer tool

1082
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,440
to right-size your
workloads in other ways.

1083
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,750
You may be wondering how
you can start assessing

1084
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,900
the savings that are
possible in your environment.

1085
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,480
So as GP mentioned, we do
have these self-service tools

1086
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,650
in the AWS Console.

1087
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,290
Compute Optimizer is
a great starting point

1088
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,680
if you like to get in the
data and do it yourself.

1089
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,560
But the OLA program is
here to support as well,

1090
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,660
wherever that would be useful for you.

1091
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,890
So Compute Optimizer does have

1092
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,430
the resource utilization data.

1093
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,070
You'll see your CPU memory
IOPS throughput usage there.

1094
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,740
It doesn't quite yet since
this feature of Optimize CPU

1095
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,909
for License Included
was just released have

1096
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:35,040
the recommendations on
whether you should disable

1097
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,220
hyper-threading, whether you
should just reduce the vCPUs

1098
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,860
instead of changing the instance type.

1099
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,290
So that's where OLA can
step in, in the interim,

1100
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,910
while they're rolling out those features

1101
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,773
to AWS Compute Optimizer.

1102
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,400
For existing AWS workloads,

1103
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,820
this program is programmatically available

1104
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,690
for any customers that are
carrying AWS Enterprise Support.

1105
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,570
This criteria is really
just tied to the fact

1106
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,640
that when customers
have Enterprise Support,

1107
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,550
we have permissions to the necessary data

1108
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,530
to do the OLA savings analysis.

1109
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,080
So this is actually a very
quick exercise for us.

1110
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,600
For you who are already running in AWS

1111
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,610
and carrying Enterprise Support,

1112
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,340
we can turn around the OLA insights

1113
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,260
in less than a week usually,

1114
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,132
and it requires almost no lift from you.

1115
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:23,520
The only thing that would require lift

1116
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,200
is really you tagging your SQL,

1117
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,550
Bring-Your-Own-License workloads

1118
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,413
if you are using any of those.

1119
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,490
So in order to launch this assessment,

1120
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,837
most of our sellers will be
familiar with the OLA program.

1121
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:38,910
AWS is a big company, so
your specific account manager

1122
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,280
might not know about the program.

1123
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,380
So ask your AWS account manager,

1124
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,402
ask your services
partner, if you're working

1125
00:50:45,402 --> 00:50:48,450
through a partner about launching an OLA,

1126
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,880
or you can use the QR code that is here.

1127
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,380
This will just pop up an email

1128
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,020
that asks some questions
about your environment

1129
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,020
and sends those responses
directly to our team,

1130
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,270
so we can get you started on your OLA

1131
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,763
for your existing EC2 environment.

1132
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,360
For your non-AWS workloads,

1133
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,960
the program is also
available for all customers.

1134
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,870
We do see, since these savings
that we've reviewed today

1135
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,080
are so Microsoft focused, that
it makes the biggest impact

1136
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,890
when you have around 100 Windows
Servers or 10 SQL Servers,

1137
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,470
licensable SQL Servers
in your environment.

1138
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,473
But we have the offering
for all customers.

1139
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,010
Again, reach out to your
AWS account manager,

1140
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,050
say you learned about OLA at re:Invent

1141
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,730
and they should know how to launch one.

1142
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,800
If not, you can contact us

1143
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,993
through this direct QR code as well.

1144
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,160
Awesome, all right.

1145
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,690
So here we've talked a lot

1146
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:45,243
about Optimize CPU for
License Included today.

1147
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,410
The census feature was
so recently released.

1148
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:52,290
We've just started to analyze
customer environments.

1149
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:55,260
I have some savings from the
last month of assessments

1150
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,060
that we've done that I'll show you.

1151
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,790
But in the meantime, we
have these blog posts,

1152
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,470
we have the user guide, we encourage you

1153
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,860
to check out that documentation,
it's very thorough,

1154
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,810
and there's a lot of self-service tools

1155
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,910
that can help you get started immediately.

1156
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,680
Give you a minute in case
anybody wants the QR code.

1157
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,500
Awesome, all right.

1158
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,980
So these are just a
handful of results, again,

1159
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,790
these savings are pretty preliminary

1160
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,460
since we just released the feature.

1161
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,610
But I tried to provide a
range of customer sizes

1162
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,260
and sample savings.

1163
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,070
We have a customer with $2
million about EC2 spend.

1164
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,660
They had projected savings
of 15% on their EC2 compute

1165
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,480
just from the Optimize CPU
for License Included features.

1166
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,180
So again, this is
incremental to right-sizing,

1167
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,480
this is incremental to other
SQL reduction opportunities

1168
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,690
we discussed like
non-prod, Dev downgrades.

1169
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,890
So 15% of savings that
weren't achievable before

1170
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,913
are now possible.

1171
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,930
And even more impressive savings
for a medium-sized customer

1172
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:02,160
that probably wasn't very
optimized, 30% savings for them,

1173
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,830
10% savings for another customer,

1174
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,580
24% savings for an extra large customer.

1175
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,410
On average, what we're seeing right now

1176
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,210
is around 20% savings.

1177
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,770
Again, it's not a huge dataset,

1178
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,730
but that's about where we
expect the savings to land

1179
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,910
on average, 20% on your
overall EC2 compute

1180
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,533
just from this one strategy.

1181
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,540
All right, so we've talked
a lot about OLA today.

1182
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,790
Today, OLA is a guided program.

1183
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,070
We have self-service tools
like the one GP mentioned,

1184
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,053
like AWS Compute Optimizer.

1185
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,260
Today, the OLA program is guided.

1186
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,690
So you engage AWS we...

1187
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,070
I either work with you directly

1188
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,680
or sometimes you'll work
with a certified OLA partner.

1189
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,300
We'll help you run the data collection,

1190
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,750
we'll do the analysis, we'll
read out the insights to you.

1191
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,354
But in an ideal world,
this would all be automated

1192
00:53:54,354 --> 00:53:56,640
and that is what we're moving towards

1193
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,700
with our tool called AWS Transform.

1194
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,580
So this is available to
you in the AWS Console.

1195
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,760
And over time, the OLA insights
that we've reviewed today

1196
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,430
are gonna roll into AWS Transform.

1197
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,620
It's not quite at parody yet,

1198
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,750
but we encourage you
to be an early adopter.

1199
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,960
Check out the tool, see
what types of migration,

1200
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,000
recommendations, and licensing insights

1201
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,370
you can already get from it today.

1202
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,740
And provide us feedback, let
us know what you think about it

1203
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,423
so we can continue enhancing it.

1204
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,180
All right, today's session
was heavily focused

1205
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,380
on Microsoft workloads.

1206
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,320
That was on purpose, but
we do wanna do a quick plug

1207
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,990
that for all major workload types,

1208
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,990
we have an assessment offering
under the OLA program.

1209
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,290
So we have modules for EUC for storage,

1210
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,770
end user computing for storage,
for VMware, for Oracle.

1211
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,320
So let us know what your
mix of workloads are,

1212
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,840
or your account manager,
or your services partner,

1213
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,060
and we'll make sure we
customize the assessment

1214
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,220
to what you have.

1215
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,600
And again, we just have the QR code

1216
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,400
if you would like to reach
out directly to the OLA team.

1217
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,210
All right, we are just
about ready to wrap up.

1218
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:09,720
I have the various QR codes
on the next two slides

1219
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,460
that we reviewed throughout the deck.

1220
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,610
So our Optimize CPU for
License Included blog,

1221
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,430
requesting an OLA, and learning more

1222
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,790
about AWS Transform assessments.

1223
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,900
Give you a minute for those.

1224
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,810
On the next slide, we have a link

1225
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,500
to our Skill Builder AWS platform.

1226
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,838
And this is a training platform

1227
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:33,660
with trainings on every AWS
topic that you could imagine.

1228
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,340
There's over 1,000 deep dives.

1229
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,740
So whatever topic you are interested in,

1230
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,680
we encourage you to check out
our Skill Builder platform

1231
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,953
to continue your Amazon
AWS learning journey.

1232
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,700
So this will link you directly

1233
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,170
to the Microsoft workload section

1234
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,670
of that Skill Builder page,

1235
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,270
but again, lots of trainings
available to you there.

1236
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,440
Awesome, so I'll wrap us up
with a couple key takeaways.

1237
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,380
We've talked about three main
things in this presentation.

1238
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,900
First, Microsoft licensing is complex,

1239
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,000
but we have the OLA
program available to you

1240
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,670
to provide clarity on
the best way to migrate

1241
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,670
your Microsoft workloads to the cloud.

1242
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,120
Second, is that we have our
very new exciting Optimize CPU

1243
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,590
for License Included features.

1244
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,730
We're really excited to see

1245
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:21,390
how this can make License
Included offerings

1246
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,430
more cost advantageous for customers,

1247
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,970
and really reduce that
license compliance management

1248
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:31,110
that they have when they
contract directly with Microsoft.

1249
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,660
And finally, AWS Transform is the future.

1250
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,400
We wanna make this as accessible

1251
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,290
as possible for our customers.

1252
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,750
So we will continue to iterate

1253
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,990
and bring these optimization
insights into AWS Transform,

1254
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,183
and we encourage you to check that out.

1255
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,150
Thank you very much for joining us,

1256
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,010
for spending the whole hour with us.

1257
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,420
We look forward to partnering with you

1258
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,470
on your migration journey

1259
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,710
or optimizing your
existing AWS environments.

1260
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,690
We'll be around if you have any questions.

1261
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,830
Thank you very much.

1262
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,050
If you don't mind filling out
the survey in the mobile app,

1263
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,023
we would really appreciate
it, enjoy re:Invent.
