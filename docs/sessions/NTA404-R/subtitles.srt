1
00:00:00,958 --> 00:00:01,729
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:04,089
Welcome to NTA 404 and welcome

3
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,948
to Reinvent. I hope you all are having,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,890
uh, some fun with all the nice

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,429
sessions just for you.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,089
Uh, my name is Pranjit. I'm a solution architect

7
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,069
and I have with me my co-speaker,

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,399
uh, Marcus Mattson, also, uh,

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,809
solutions architect, and I hope

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,579
everyone's having a good day one.

11
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:22,888
Everyone doing all right,

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,219
enjoying its sessions.

13
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:27,120
All right, a deal. Nice.

14
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,269
And, uh,

15
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:30,649
uh, uh, thank you again for

16
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,810
spending next one hour with us. So today's

17
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,289
topic is AI code to production context

18
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,408
matters. How many of you, like, if I have a

19
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:39,408
quick raise of your hands, how many of you

20
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,770
are using some kind of AI coding assistant

21
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,630
to code?

22
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:46,689
Quite a few. OK, nice. How many of

23
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,728
you have started playing

24
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:50,399
or dabbling around with our

25
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,329
agentic ID tool Quiro?

26
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,639
OK, not bad. OK. All right.

27
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,139
So. In today's session,

28
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:00,228
what we're gonna cover is, uh, this is a

29
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,340
code talk, so we're gonna do a lot of coding,

30
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,480
uh, while you are here. But before that,

31
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,668
just to set the, uh, stage today,

32
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,909
we're gonna talk about some of the AI

33
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,109
code production problem like when you build, like

34
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:13,230
when you do vibe coding or you are doing some

35
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,230
kind of prompt engineering and creating

36
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,388
some nice code,

37
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:18,790
uh, what is the challenge that typically

38
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,989
happens when they go in production and how

39
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:21,569
we can.

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,159
Uh, like, do context engineering

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,000
to kind of

42
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,579
put those code, uh, make

43
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,948
those code like production ready,

44
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,019
and, uh, then, uh,

45
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,500
the next thing that we're gonna cover is, we're

46
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,819
gonna talk about some of the essential context

47
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,819
layers, uh, for your success

48
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,308
when you are building AI code,

49
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,069
and then, uh, some of the key takeaways

50
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,540
of from today's session, some of the workshops,

51
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,838
uh, that we want to highlight that you can get started

52
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:48,558
with. So, having said that.

53
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,219
Let's quickly, uh,

54
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,599
talk about a developer named

55
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,638
Sarah, OK? She's a senior

56
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:56,150
developer.

57
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,680
She started doing vibe coding and

58
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,799
she faced some challenges. Let's see what are the challenges

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,000
that she faced and how she overcome that.

60
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,599
Let's talk about a journey that I think every

61
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,879
developer knows deep down.

62
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,439
It's the move from that frantic adrenaline

63
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,758
fueled last minute hack to the calm

64
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,919
confidence you get from building something you know is

65
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,669
rock solid.

66
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,000
It's really a story about the hidden dangers

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,538
of just making it work.

68
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,099
You know the feeling, right? It's Friday afternoon,

69
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,599
a huge deadline is staring you down, and

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,719
the only thing anyone cares about is getting

71
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,278
something,

72
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,599
anything up and running for that demo.

73
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
That pressure, well, that's exactly where

74
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,379
our story kicks off.

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,500
All right, so let's set the scene.

76
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:36,819
This first part is all about a gamble.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,199
It's about a very tempting but also very

78
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,229
dangerous way of developing software,

79
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,719
especially now that we've all got these incredibly

80
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,058
powerful AI tools right at our fingertips.

81
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,080
So let's meet Sarah. She's a talented

82
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
developer. She knows her stuff, but

83
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,399
right now she's completely up against

84
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,520
the wall. A really critical demo

85
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,639
is just a few hours away and she needs

86
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,460
a miracle,

87
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,088
fast. So what does she do?

88
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,490
She dives into what we're going to call vibe

89
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,080
coding.

90
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,849
She's just firing off prompts to her AI

91
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,050
tool, grabbing the code snippets it spits

92
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,129
out and stitching them together based on

93
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,129
her gut feeling.

94
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,599
There's no big architectural plan, no

95
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,719
deep thinking. It's all about speed and that

96
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,270
feeling of,

97
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,860
yeah, yeah, that looks about right.

98
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,750
And you know what? It totally works.

99
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,919
The demo goes off without a hitch.

100
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,159
The feature is a hit. The stakeholders

101
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,199
are thrilled, and Sarah's the hero of the

102
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,939
hour. She pulled it off.

103
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,050
But that amazing feeling, that rush

104
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,080
of confidence,

105
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,740
well, it's kind of built on sand.

106
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,219
Of course, that Friday high,

107
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,319
yeah, it doesn't last long

108
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,020
because the nice, clean, predictable world

109
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,618
of a demo is nothing like the absolute

110
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:50,118
chaos of a live production environment.

111
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,409
And this,

112
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:53,819
this is where that shortcut comes back to bite

113
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,479
her, hard.

114
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,159
This is when reality hits.

115
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,020
Monday morning rolls around, the code gets

116
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,159
pushed live, and almost instantly

117
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:04,689
alarms start going off.

118
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:05,860
The whole thing,

119
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,250
the system that worked so beautifully in the

120
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,409
demo, just completely falls apart

121
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,710
under the weight of real users and real world data.

122
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,099
It is an absolute catastrophe.

123
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,778
And look at the kinds of problems we're talking about.

124
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,189
These are not simple bugs. These are the

125
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:22,309
deep, gnarly, architectural

126
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,019
nightmares.

127
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,449
You've got race conditions, corrupting data,

128
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,309
massive security holes, compliance failures,

129
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,540
and memory leaks that are crashing servers left

130
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,139
and right.

131
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,660
These are the huge invisible icebergs

132
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,809
that vibe coding just sails straight into.

133
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,910
And this is the moment it all clicks

134
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,910
for Sarah. This is her big

135
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,949
aha moment.

136
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,389
The AI wasn't the problem at all.

137
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,850
It did exactly what she told it to do. The

138
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,970
problem was she didn't know what to ask

139
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,000
for. She asked for a feature, sure,

140
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,488
but what she actually needed was a production

141
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:54,509
ready system,

142
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,149
and those are two completely different things.

143
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,608
So this total disaster, it becomes a

144
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:00,750
massive turning point.

145
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:03,548
Sarah realizes she just can't work like this

146
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:05,889
anymore. It's time to evolve, to level up

147
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,269
from being a reactive vibe coder into something

148
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,889
way more intentional,

149
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,389
way more powerful, a

150
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,569
context architect.

151
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,600
Now, let's be super clear. This isn't

152
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,678
about her throwing out her AI tools. No

153
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:20,678
way. It's about getting way

154
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,178
smarter in how she uses them.

155
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,480
It's a shift from just asking for a chunk of

156
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,639
code to providing the AI with

157
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,108
deep, rich structural context,

158
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,540
so it can generate code that's not just working,

159
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:33,439
but is genuinely robust.

160
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,028
So how does she actually make this shift?

161
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,910
Well, she adopts a new framework.

162
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,528
You can think of it like a blueprint for success, a

163
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,649
way to feed the AI all the right information

164
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:43,588
from the very start.

165
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,209
Let's walk through these four layers of architecture

166
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,889
that pretty much change everything for her.

167
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,769
OK, here's how this blueprint works. It

168
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,129
all starts with requirements.

169
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,619
This is where she thinks through every possible edge

170
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,689
case, every failure mode, all that

171
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,160
security and compliance stuff.

172
00:05:58,528 --> 00:05:59,750
Next up is design.

173
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:02,250
Here, she's planning things like concurrency to

174
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,369
avoid those exact race conditions that burned

175
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:05,069
her before.

176
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,730
Then comes implementation,

177
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,209
building the code from day one so that it's easy

178
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,250
to observe, scale, and maintain.

179
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,709
And finally, the operational layer.

180
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,040
This is where she's thinking ahead about monitoring for

181
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,079
things like memory leaks before it becomes

182
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,259
a 5 alarm fire.

183
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,939
This table really just lays it all out, doesn't it?

184
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,259
On one side, you have the vibe coder. They're reactive,

185
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,439
they use vague prompts, and they get code that's good

186
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,259
enough for a demo.

187
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,519
They're asking, what do I build? But the

188
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,720
context architect is systematic. They use

189
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,920
structured prompts to get genuinely production ready

190
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,720
code. They're asking the deeper questions,

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,178
why are we building this and how will this thing behave under

192
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,665
every possible kind Of stress.

193
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,584
So armed with this whole new mindset,

194
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,625
Sarah gets a shot at redemption,

195
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,225
and the stakes, they could not be

196
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:49,733
higher. Another urgent, super

197
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,934
critical request lands on her desk, but

198
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:54,125
this time it's right before the biggest,

199
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,625
most intense traffic day of the entire

200
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,463
year, Black Friday.

201
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,129
But this time is different. There's

202
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,209
no panic, there's no last minute vibe

203
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:03,720
coding.

204
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,199
She just calmly and methodically works through

205
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,528
her four layers, building out a comprehensive

206
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,869
plan. She then uses that plan

207
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:12,970
to create these incredibly detailed,

208
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,649
context-rich prompts for her AI assistant,

209
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,889
guiding it to build a system that is

210
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,869
resilient right from its core.

211
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,528
So Black Friday hits, the website

212
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,528
gets absolutely slammed with a

213
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,689
flood of traffic unlike anything they've ever

214
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,738
seen. The entire team is just

215
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:31,309
holding their breath, glued to the monitoring dashboards,

216
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,170
and the number of critical errors, the number of outages,

217
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,399
the amount of downtime,

218
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,879
it's a big, beautiful 0,

219
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,660
a perfect performance.

220
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,980
The system she's so carefully designed as

221
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,009
a context architect scales

222
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,019
up perfectly. It handles the

223
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,160
insane load without a single

224
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,579
hiccup. I mean, if that's not the ultimate

225
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,639
proof that this new approach works, I don't know what

226
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,199
is.

227
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:55,858
And really, that's the core lesson

228
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,040
of this whole journey.

229
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,500
The magic isn't the fact that AI can

230
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,649
write code for us.

231
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,059
The real skill, the thing that truly marks

232
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,100
the leap from a good developer to a

233
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,338
great one, is knowing what context

234
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:08,160
you need to feed it.

235
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,889
And so that brings us to the final question,

236
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,720
and this one's for you to think about.

237
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,079
The next time that deadline is looming and

238
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,309
the pressure is on, which one are you gonna be?

239
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,730
Are you gonna be the vibe coder, crossing your fingers

240
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,028
and just hoping for the best,

241
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,250
or are you going to be the context architect,

242
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,850
building for reality?

243
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:29,079
OK.

244
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,678
So, having seen

245
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,899
that, right, uh, these are some of the

246
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
challenges, right? Uh, or

247
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,599
why AI code fails in production. AI

248
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,678
models, they're trained on a

249
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:42,918
lot of code, right? But they don't

250
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:44,058
know your business.

251
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:47,798
There are certain AWS environment specific

252
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:50,038
information that you have in your AWS account,

253
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,219
but it is not aware of it, right?

254
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,445
Uh, it Is not aware of any kind of regulations

255
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,543
or security compliance

256
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:58,945
and any kind of other

257
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,504
compliance requirements that you are supposed

258
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,793
to take care of when you're developing code.

259
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:06,445
It is not aware of the cost implications.

260
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,565
Are there any challenges in respect to how

261
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,565
you want to architect your AWS

262
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:11,484
environment for any

263
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,724
production of the application, right? So,

264
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,125
having said that,

265
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:18,119
These are some of the context, uh, that we're

266
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,359
gonna see how we can address, like how we can layer

267
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,639
this context into

268
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,428
our solution which is called Quiro, the agentic

269
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:26,710
ID, uh, from prototype to production,

270
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,739
which gives you

271
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:30,779
a lot of flexibility how you can inject context

272
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,918
in runtime, how you can use the long term

273
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:35,389
memory within, uh, the

274
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,678
application itself to build something which you can deploy

275
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,830
on day one in production, right? So

276
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,700
some of them are like the how you can

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,519
create. Business context and feed that

278
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,000
still utilizing the entire context window

279
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
because context window is something that you

280
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,029
don't want to fill with all your documents dumping

281
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,859
into and filling all the space

282
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,558
to leave nothing for the LLM to be creative

283
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:57,599
enough to come up with something

284
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,599
useful for your production application. So you

285
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,798
need to know how you can utilize your context window

286
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:02,580
efficiently.

287
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,058
Uh, for your production ready application,

288
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,599
last but not the least is the AWS context.

289
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:10,219
So you need to make sure the

290
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:12,548
application that you're building, which you're planning to deploy on AWS,

291
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,038
are also following the best practices. We

292
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,038
call it well architected framework, right?

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,879
Uh, it,

294
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,710
if you have certain cost related constraints,

295
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,840
you want to also give that information

296
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,369
to the,

297
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,019
uh, the AI coding assistant,

298
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:28,080
how you can do that. So all those things we're gonna

299
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,158
look into, uh, the Quiro part of

300
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,750
it and then see how we can use Quiro.

301
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,104
And some of the features that we have in Qiro to

302
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,965
come up with the production of the applications. So

303
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,825
I'm gonna switch to my, uh, other

304
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,945
uh demo laptop, and we're gonna talk

305
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:43,183
about a gaming company. Let's say Sarah

306
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,283
is a, uh, is working in a gaming,

307
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:47,423
uh, company, and she's supposed to build a

308
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,803
game application, right? And how

309
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,825
she starts introducing

310
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,014
context, how she is utilizing those contexts

311
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,264
to be able to come up with a production application that

312
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,264
is ready to deploy on AWS.

313
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,465
So with that, I'm gonna switch

314
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,075
to my.

315
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah, and if you're like me, you've seen AI

316
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,788
coding assistants generate some really impressive

317
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,859
stuff, and then you've seen it create

318
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:10,649
some stuff that

319
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,889
uh lacked a little bit.

320
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:15,460
And so you're probably thinking, show me, and

321
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,250
that's what Pranjeet's gonna do.

322
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,469
All right. Uh, can anyone confirm, like,

323
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:22,700
are you able to see or do I need to zoom

324
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,739
more? You're

325
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:25,798
good? OK. All right.

326
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,219
So this is uh the Kiro

327
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,379
ID. There are two flavors to Kiro. One

328
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,379
is the CLI part of it. One is the ID.

329
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,969
So if anyone is like familiar with

330
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,359
like coding using keto CLI,

331
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,500
you can do that.

332
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,859
Uh, folks who are actually like maybe

333
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:43,250
working on Visual Studio,

334
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,820
it's a VS code for hero, so you

335
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,000
can get all your visual code settings.

336
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,678
On boarded to Quiro when you're deploying like the

337
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,840
uh installing it and you're uh you're

338
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,080
starting to use it. So for our session

339
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,109
we're gonna use the Quiro ID not the

340
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:59,119
Quiro CLA, but you have two flavors. So just

341
00:11:59,119 --> 00:11:59,859
to let you know

342
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,529
now this is a

343
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,918
I've just set the stage. So what I've

344
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:05,619
done is initially I have.

345
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:08,440
Let me do,

346
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,158
OK. So I've set a

347
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:13,538
folder called a game app

348
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,639
and I have placed a Kiro logo over

349
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,340
here. That's just a blank

350
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,359
uh application with nothing inside it other than a logo

351
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,538
page and then.

352
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,649
What I'm gonna, uh, if you see the ghost icon

353
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,149
is where you would see

354
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:27,668
a lot of additional

355
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:30,570
features like agent hooks, you

356
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,729
have agent steering, and you have MCP

357
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,979
servers, right? So we're gonna cover all of them.

358
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:37,250
Now, uh, in the agent steering,

359
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:38,830
you see there's a

360
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,330
global steering rule called SE

361
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,788
global rules, which is

362
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,750
a condition that I put

363
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:46,229
for all my.

364
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,950
Applications that I'm gonna build with kiro

365
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,000
agentic ID. So what I want is this is the

366
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,070
global steering rule. So how do you, when

367
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,119
you actually go into the agent steering and

368
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:55,859
hit this.

369
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,379
Plus button, you have like 3 options over

370
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,678
here. The first one is

371
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,178
creating from scratch where if

372
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,158
you have any code base already

373
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,019
there in this repo, if

374
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,639
not, it's going to create some basic

375
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,500
uh markdown files. There's

376
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
one which is called global agent steering, and

377
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,580
there's one foundational steering rule. So

378
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,700
for the one that I'm showing here, it is the

379
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,899
global agent steering. That means it is

380
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:21,599
stored in

381
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:22,639
the home

382
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,288
folder of kero under the steering. So that

383
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,731
way this global. Rules are applicable for any

384
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,731
application that I build through Kiiro and I'm gonna show how it

385
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:32,263
is going to take care. So I have given like a specific

386
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:34,491
information of that when I'm gonna use

387
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:36,572
spec driven development, uh, instead of

388
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,812
vibe, uh, always, uh, create the

389
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:41,251
requirements, mark down document, uh,

390
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:43,722
and then, uh, also list, uh,

391
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:45,192
different persons, right? Uh,

392
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:48,001
when actually the requirements documents are created,

393
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,251
it doesn't give the persons, but I want that

394
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,251
the user stories and the

395
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,533
acceptance criteria that it creates should have a personal

396
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,546
attached. It, I also want like when it

397
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,634
is creating a design document,

398
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:01,195
it also should include an ER or entity

399
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,195
relationship diagram for me if there's a

400
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,245
database schema involved, right? And then

401
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,514
the other one is like when it is creating the tasks,

402
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:08,504
it should also,

403
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,995
uh, organize the task so that

404
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,085
like after each and every granular task I should

405
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,365
be able to like demo uh a unit

406
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:17,565
test like what exactly the

407
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,785
application looks like after this task, right? So

408
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,384
for our

409
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:23,825
project what I'm gonna do is.

410
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:26,798
I'll go back to this

411
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,719
folder structure.

412
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:31,029
Uh,

413
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:39,298
Bear with me.

414
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,580
So I'm gonna create a,

415
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,239
a specific steering rule. Steering rules

416
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,460
are something that is

417
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
uh specific to this

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,038
application. It is always going to refer to the steering

419
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,700
rules when it is trying to come up with the requirements

420
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,580
and the design and the task.

421
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,440
So,

422
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,808
Let me create it from scratch.

423
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,129
Uh, building rules. So these are my

424
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:05,158
standards that I always want

425
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,149
hero to take care of

426
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,450
when it is building an application. So it comes

427
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,690
with this template. It has inclusion

428
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,889
always on the top. That means it is always

429
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,168
going to include the specific instructions

430
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,210
that I'm gonna put over here when

431
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,678
it is trying to come up with the, uh,

432
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,908
requirements and a design.

433
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,320
So I'm gonna

434
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,609
paste it over here. So what I've done is, like I've

435
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:29,460
mentioned. Let's

436
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,330
say a game building application rules.

437
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,330
When you're, you're a helpful game building agent,

438
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:36,070
you must always adhere to like

439
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,308
the preferred languages. So let's say you're like

440
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,989
creating any Python

441
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,570
applications, so you can put those specific

442
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,690
information specific to your scenario, but you

443
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,719
can give any number of information

444
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,879
based on what your stand like standards are, what

445
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,129
your company standards are, what kind of coding

446
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,509
rules that you follow. So you can give all these

447
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,009
over here and then I'm gonna save it.

448
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,288
And I'm going to create one more markdown file,

449
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,710
which is specific to the styling

450
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,729
part of it. So what kind of colors that I

451
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,269
want. And

452
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,889
anything related to to design.

453
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,750
So I'm gonna come here.

454
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,259
And then I'm gonna create one more.

455
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:20,700
styling guy.

456
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,058
And light and then.

457
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm gonna

458
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,808
Paste it over here. So if you see over here, I've given

459
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:31,408
like specific color schemas.

460
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,899
And some of the usage guidelines

461
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,979
and some design guidelines that I

462
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:37,639
like to

463
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,000
uh adhere when I'm actually building this

464
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,239
gaming application.

465
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,340
Now, I

466
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,379
will switch to Y. So as I mentioned,

467
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,629
right, Hero gives you flexibility. So we,

468
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,139
there are certain scenarios where Y coding is

469
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,719
relevant. Like if you want to build a quick prototype,

470
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,979
Y coding is still the go to path, right?

471
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,038
If you are building something which is production

472
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,759
ready, uh, definitely advised

473
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,099
to use peg-based coding which follows the typical

474
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:05,699
SDLC process of like planning first

475
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,699
rather than just prompting and praying like wipe

476
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:09,939
coding, right, so that it gives you the right

477
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,969
code because like typically in vi coding what

478
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,009
happens is that when you give a

479
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,675
Big prompted all the information, it starts

480
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,744
coding without even thinking, and then the code that

481
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,796
it comes out, you probably have to

482
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:21,796
like revise it so you go back and ask, OK,

483
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,115
can you add this? And then it goes and tries

484
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:25,655
to address that specific,

485
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:28,556
uh, last, uh, chat

486
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:30,595
history, and then it forgets what it has created

487
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,734
initially and then you go into regression

488
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,884
and you keep on troubleshooting to come up with a

489
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,195
appli like a a code that you can really

490
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,311
play with, right. Whereas in spec based

491
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,270
is more of like doing all the planning,

492
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,671
making sure they are approved like either

493
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,971
by your product manager or your architect team,

494
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,231
or even if it is you're a senior developer and you

495
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,231
have the ownership to, uh, approve all the

496
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,821
use cases, and then you start then, uh,

497
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,651
building the code so that the

498
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,951
code that is being built is adhering to all

499
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,030
the requirements and a design

500
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,151
that you have approved, right? So that's kind of difference between

501
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:02,411
vibe and spec based.

502
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:03,337
Right now,

503
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:04,686
so, so just a quick

504
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,577
on, on these documents you just created the,

505
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,287
the, uh, steering docks, the rules basically

506
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,666
the global are gonna be your organizational

507
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,027
standards and the others are specific to this

508
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,807
project and one of those was marked always

509
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,228
so that means whether you're using VIB or spec

510
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,847
it's gonna refer back to those

511
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,317
steering dock rules.

512
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:23,446
Yes, so

513
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:25,906
you can set certain guidelines at the global

514
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,364
steering level and then you. Have certain guidelines

515
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:30,503
at the like the workspace level

516
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,583
right? but then typically the workspace level

517
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,583
steering like if there's a collision between the

518
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,053
global and the workspace, uh,

519
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,374
the, the global steering rules

520
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:41,503
are not getting the precedence it's basically

521
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,553
the workspace specific guideline

522
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,624
that takes, uh, precedence

523
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,743
in respect to what it is going to build, right? So

524
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:48,364
that's how

525
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:51,063
that takes, uh, precedence, right? So yeah, good

526
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,163
question. Thanks, Marcus.

527
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:53,423
OK, now.

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
I just have an idea of this game that I want

529
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,189
to build. I want to build a flappy kiro

530
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:00,318
game right now. I can

531
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:02,739
use Vibe to just go and ask, like,

532
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,118
uh, build a very basic version

533
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:07,400
for my prototype for my ideation, right? So

534
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
maybe I can start with Vibe instead of like

535
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,519
starting with the spec best.

536
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,324
So I have an. Idea and I

537
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,354
paste a

538
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,233
prompt over here and if you see I just mentioned

539
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,775
I want to build a flappy kiro game please

540
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,795
create a very basic working version.

541
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:23,295
I've given some information like uh what

542
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,904
kind of canvas you should use for rendering

543
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:28,555
kiro character I mentioned there is a uh.

544
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,160
Image over there in the document

545
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,199
so it can refer to that. So I've given

546
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,618
some basic information. I just did vibe coding

547
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,699
and I told, OK, go and do for me

548
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,180
now while it is building that like,

549
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:43,239
uh, while it is coming up with the code, if you see over

550
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,239
here there are certain options like one

551
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,358
is the autopilot. So autopilot in the

552
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,358
sense I've given some autonomy to this

553
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,219
agentic ID so that it can take some,

554
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,420
uh, like, uh,

555
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,660
it can take some.

556
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,318
Actions without even asking me or prompting me, OK,

557
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,838
approved for everything. If I toggle

558
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,880
that off, it's gonna ask me for

559
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,868
everything that it does on the code base, right?

560
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,739
There are options of like

561
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,598
selecting different models from here. Like

562
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,759
you can select Opus model, you can select

563
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,858
cloud, or you can go in auto mode so that like

564
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,299
the agentic ID can

565
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,799
decide based on what kind of context and what

566
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,858
kind of task that it is doing. It can

567
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:19,880
toggle between different.

568
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:20,838
Uh,

569
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,299
models, right? So for me I've

570
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,170
selected cloud 4.5. So,

571
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,539
uh, I stick to that. And then the other

572
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,959
option is there's an option of adding images.

573
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:30,920
So let's say you

574
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,420
are coming out of a meeting, you did a whiteboarding

575
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,459
of a gaming application and you took

576
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,539
a picture of maybe an ERD diagram that you

577
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,598
have drawn out in the in the. Uh, uh,

578
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,680
meeting or you might have drawn an architecture

579
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,088
diagram, uh, with, with your stakeholders,

580
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
right? You can take a picture and you can upload it over

581
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,279
here and then it can, you can ask you

582
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,479
to kind of come up with the plan so

583
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,680
it has like a multimodal feature as well

584
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,920
where you can take some images and put it into the context

585
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,078
to come up with those requirements for you, right? So

586
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:57,910
it can do that

587
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,410
now. If you see

588
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,150
over here,

589
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,930
uh, it has,

590
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,489
this is what I, I wanted to show you. So when it

591
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,588
started like vibe coding

592
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:09,608
it included the steering documents, so the

593
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,729
one is the global one and then the couple

594
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,430
of them that I mentioned I created

595
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,890
specific to this workspace, right? And

596
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,009
then it says, OK, let's build a flappy game

597
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,250
together. So it went ahead and it created

598
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,368
some stuff. So if I go back

599
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,568
here in this one it.

600
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,479
Let's see. Once you answer this, OK, so

601
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,598
it has asking me to answer. So

602
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:33,078
I'll create a playable version

603
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
and all the games. So it, it is asking, so

604
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,779
if you see over here,

605
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,719
what I mentioned over here in the

606
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:42,019
app building rules, right? I asked.

607
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,799
That suggest

608
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:45,858
creative ways and then

609
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,358
take user's input and create a user

610
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,459
context MD steering file

611
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,559
to store user preferences as you

612
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,160
help the user build a game.

613
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,838
So it just didn't go and

614
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:59,000
started creating code just like vibe coding does,

615
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:00,920
right? So now it is asking me, OK,

616
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:03,364
can you address these questions. That I have

617
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,525
for you, uh, before even I go and

618
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,545
code, right? So that's why like you

619
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,594
are actually acting as a driver in the seat,

620
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:10,463
not giving

621
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:12,844
the whole autonomy to the ID

622
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:14,844
tool to come and, uh, uh, uh,

623
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,963
create the code, right? So maybe let me give

624
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:19,164
you, give some instructions over here, right?

625
00:22:19,285 --> 00:22:21,324
So what visual studio do you

626
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:22,703
prefer? So let's say.

627
00:22:23,848 --> 00:22:24,890
Classic

628
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:26,969
flappy bird game.

629
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,400
And then it says, obstacle. What should the obstacles

630
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,979
look like?

631
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,858
Traditional.

632
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
And then scoring, how should scoring work? plus

633
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,680
one?

634
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,439
Wine based on.

635
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:45,959
Sulfa equal time.

636
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,348
All right. So I've given that

637
00:22:48,348 --> 00:22:50,299
information and then Quo goes.

638
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,449
And starts

639
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:55,769
OK. So now it has started the

640
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:57,049
HTML page

641
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,630
for the game.

642
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,309
And if you see over here, it has started appearing over

643
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,130
here, and then it has started creating the JavaScript.

644
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:14,039
Uh. So

645
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,199
once it is created, we're

646
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,640
going to look into the

647
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:22,519
The code itself. So, let me go

648
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,039
here.

649
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,250
And then let's see what it is building.

650
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,809
Yeah, it's starting to already give us

651
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,250
hints that this could start to become a more

652
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,630
complex application.

653
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:35,269
It's, it's asking about user preferences

654
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,529
and you're starting to wonder maybe vibe coding is

655
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,269
not going to be enough.

656
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:41,689
So let's see what it's got put together

657
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:42,269
so far.

658
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,858
So it has.

659
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:45,660
Yeah.

660
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:50,838
So, it is a very basic one, right? It

661
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,920
just doesn't do anything. It doesn't have any kind of

662
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,880
scoring, uh, like sto,

663
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,380
it is not storing any

664
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,598
information over here. So it's a very basic one just for

665
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:01,118
ideation, right? Now,

666
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,858
Once I'm done with the

667
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,559
Vibe coding, OK, I have a plan

668
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,640
now, and now what I want to

669
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,719
do is I want to add some features like I

670
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,838
want to store the player's score and

671
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:16,400
also the high score. I want to add some visual

672
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,358
effects like some kind of trail particles,

673
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:20,939
some kind of explosion effects, and

674
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,604
some sparkles like when it passes. Through some obstacles,

675
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:25,805
so there's like a lot of like additional features that I

676
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:27,924
want to, uh, add that means

677
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,213
that I'm gonna touch a lot of like

678
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:32,765
code base as well as I'm gonna create a lot of additional

679
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:33,703
files, and I want

680
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,644
this keyro to kind of come up with a plan

681
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:38,644
before even it starts coding, right? So that's why like

682
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,505
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna switch.

683
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:42,979
Over here

684
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,118
So I'm gonna open a

685
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:50,059
new context, uh, and

686
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,140
then I'm gonna a new window and then

687
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,039
I'm gonna move to spec,

688
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,078
and this is where the fun will start. So

689
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,219
what I've told, OK, help me add like save game

690
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,259
history and sports, right? I told about some

691
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,838
of the visual effects and then I told creative.

692
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:06,529
Minimum viable product for the above

693
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,358
features and I wanted it to

694
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,098
list only 5 tasks rather than

695
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:13,338
going more granular. Like if I don't give this

696
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:14,368
specific information,

697
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,769
it probably will come up with like 9 or 10

698
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:19,180
or maybe 11 steps, and it's very granular.

699
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:19,959
That's fine

700
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,500
for some developers for the sake of today's

701
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,759
time. I just wanted to limit it to 5 tasks. So

702
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:25,618
once I'm

703
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:27,299
given that, I'm gonna

704
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,979
hit enter and then if you

705
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:32,219
see. It now reads

706
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,338
again, always like when it starts doing something,

707
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,318
it always is

708
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:37,430
looking into the steering documents,

709
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,479
and then

710
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:41,039
now it is reading the existing code base.

711
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,709
And now it started creating the requirements

712
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,009
document. Now, if I hover over here,

713
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,618
And then if I go to specs,

714
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,868
it has created a folder and

715
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:55,229
then it has started creating a requirements document

716
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:55,809
for me

717
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,068
and as I have shown you

718
00:25:58,068 --> 00:26:00,150
the first time I mentioned

719
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,459
that I want

720
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:03,910
so it has created the requirements document

721
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,910
and now it is waiting for me to like move to

722
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,989
design phase which is the next step but before even I

723
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:08,689
go there

724
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,549
is the user stories and the acceptance criteria

725
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,390
but what I mentioned is that I mentioned

726
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,709
give me the.

727
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,689
Personals as well, right? So if you

728
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:19,750
see over here this is something that it

729
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,430
created

730
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:23,088
based on my specific global steering

731
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:24,269
rules where I mentioned

732
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,368
introduce the persons and tell me which user

733
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,170
story is related to which persona,

734
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,489
right? So if you see over here. It has some user

735
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,118
stories

736
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,578
and some of the person is attached and what is the

737
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:36,719
acceptance criteria so it's the EIR's

738
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,759
notation right

739
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,568
now if I have validated everything looks good,

740
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:42,939
uh, I move to design phase

741
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,979
or else I can say, OK,

742
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:45,838
um.

743
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,338
Have you

744
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:55,140
Taken care of.

745
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,489
Deploying this

746
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:01,049
code to AWS

747
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:02,410
using

748
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,130
serverless.

749
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:06,449
Services.

750
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:09,348
So if I, I can still chat, right,

751
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:11,368
just like vibe coding, but I can ask,

752
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,068
OK, have you done that?

753
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,348
Let's see.

754
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,279
Now, I haven't moved into the design phase

755
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,400
yet, but then it says, OK, no,

756
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,759
the spec, OK, so it has come up with, no, the spec

757
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,759
focuses on the game enhancement features you

758
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,269
requested,

759
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,699
and it says the current game runs on HTML

760
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:28,920
5. If you would like to add AWS

761
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,318
deployment or back end,

762
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,019
OK, save, so it has given me, OK, would you like

763
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,199
to continue with the spec as is for visual or

764
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,759
add AWS deployment? So, let's say I

765
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,239
select 2.

766
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:41,680
As an option

767
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,289
And then it goes back and then updates

768
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,868
the same requirements documents. So until and unless

769
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,289
the requirements is finalized and I approve

770
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:53,449
it, it's not gonna move to the

771
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:54,848
design phase, right? And

772
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:57,509
so, yeah, so if you see over here, it has started.

773
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,469
Updating the requirements and I can look

774
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:03,509
like I can select here and you can

775
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:05,368
see the diff. So what is the additional

776
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,368
information that it is adding

777
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,949
on top of the existing one, right? So it

778
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:10,848
gets highlighted.

779
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:14,150
Over here now while it creates

780
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,189
those spec docs, it refers back to

781
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:18,289
the steering docks so that it makes sure

782
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:19,469
that it follows

783
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,759
the rules that you've given it and these

784
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,900
requirements, I mean it's requirements gathering,

785
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,439
right? That's one of the things that often misses

786
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,009
or gets missed in vibe coding and

787
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:31,189
and as we get further along, you'll start to see

788
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:33,189
how these specifications

789
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,650
are actually used invalidating the code

790
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,068
that the AI is creating or generating,

791
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,539
yeah. So now if everything

792
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:42,578
looks good, OK, let's move to the

793
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:44,858
design phase is where I hit the design phase,

794
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,910
right? Uh, and then,

795
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,439
And I say, OK,

796
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,979
government's good. And then it went to the design

797
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:54,049
phase. All right. So, let's go back

798
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:56,098
here. And then

799
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:57,618
I move to design.

800
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,318
So it's gonna start building the design which is

801
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,439
basically the technical architecture and

802
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,799
the mermaid diagram,

803
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,479
uh, for me to validate right now

804
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:09,019
while it is doing that, I wanted to showcase

805
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,259
over here like when I select the hosty

806
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:12,818
button I have additional

807
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,279
like tools that I've added like for example

808
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:15,828
some of the

809
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:18,680
existing AWS specific MCP

810
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,759
servers like one for the documentation

811
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,160
so that I always like whatever I am building, I

812
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,199
want to follow the best practices. So I always

813
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,205
want like Quiro to. Go and look into the

814
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,306
best practices for that appli like

815
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,765
uh based on whether it's a serverless or a

816
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:33,765
container based, right? So I want to follow

817
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:36,175
that so I, it can go and look into these tools,

818
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:38,605
uh, using the MCP servers. I want also

819
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:40,806
like, uh, and I'm gonna do that, OK, like

820
00:29:40,806 --> 00:29:42,806
create an architecture diagram out of the

821
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:45,125
entire application that I've built so I can use the diagram

822
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,224
MCP server. So

823
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,605
there are additional like third party

824
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:50,826
MCP servers like for example Fetch like

825
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:53,144
let's say I'm building a trading system

826
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:55,551
application and there is some exist. Existing trading system

827
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:58,092
applications out there. I want to

828
00:29:58,092 --> 00:30:00,401
like ask Quiro to go and

829
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,612
uh check the URL of the trading system

830
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:05,131
and compare with the one that I'm building or maybe any

831
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,332
application and see if there's any additional features

832
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:09,432
that I want to use in my

833
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,641
uh application, right? So it can go and

834
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:14,250
like look up existing like external

835
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,911
URL to come up with some

836
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,171
comparison and features say that I'm missing in

837
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:20,571
my application. So it can do a lot of like based on

838
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,490
what kind of incentive server that you want to integrate.

839
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:24,858
Uh, the other thing which is important is the

840
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:25,759
agent hoax,

841
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,019
and this is very interesting, and I'm gonna,

842
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,199
uh, show you like while it is building,

843
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:31,838
uh, still the design

844
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,118
document, uh, let me go

845
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:35,799
over here.

846
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,368
And this is something is built on

847
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:41,890
um the event-driven architecture of AWS

848
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,969
whereas let's say I want this

849
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:44,709
hook like

850
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:46,269
whenever.

851
00:30:47,118 --> 00:30:47,858
Any

852
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,559
codebase file is.

853
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,689
Updated

854
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,150
and saved.

855
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,108
Please do the.

856
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,118
Unit testing.

857
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:02,449
To ensure it doesn't.

858
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,588
Break any?

859
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,299
Existing features. So if that is

860
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,338
a very basic like hook that I

861
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,539
want to use for an event ribbon like whenever a

862
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,949
new file or an existing file is updated, I

863
00:31:15,949 --> 00:31:18,180
want at the back end, uh, for the agent

864
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,500
to go and make sure like nothing

865
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,739
breaks because of some additional code that I've introduced

866
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,900
or or uh updated an existing one.

867
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,640
So I can like create a

868
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:28,769
hook and what it does is that.

869
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:31,479
You can see like it has execution

870
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,769
queued, that means the design is

871
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:34,868
still being created when

872
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,799
uh this execution is queued so I can open

873
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,130
the task list so I can see like multiple

874
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,170
tasks right now. So right now if you see it is

875
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,789
in the design phase, so it's

876
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:44,828
doing the

877
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,189
uh design document

878
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:48,670
creation, whereas this. Task creating the hook

879
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,900
is still in the queue, right? So once the

880
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,989
previous one is completed, the next task is

881
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:55,068
going to, uh, execute. So you can

882
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:56,588
see the queue as well. All right,

883
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,650
now I'm gonna

884
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,170
switch back into my design

885
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,009
and let's see. So there's an

886
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,289
icon here where you want to like

887
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,150
look it,

888
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,130
look in a better one, OK, so you can like even

889
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,160
expand this

890
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:13,549
and you can look into the design in a

891
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,049
better view like.

892
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:16,489
Let me

893
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,910
scroll this part of you so that

894
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,348
it is much more visible to all of you, so

895
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:22,009
you can even.

896
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,969
Look, OK, this is the high-level architecture.

897
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:28,459
was the client side, server side,

898
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:30,809
and then the component interaction

899
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:31,380
flow.

900
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:35,568
And everything. So you can look into the

901
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:36,588
data model

902
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,598
and then

903
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:41,769
Still executing, so let me

904
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,838
Right over here. OK. So now it has, yeah,

905
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,189
so it has now completed and it says,

906
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,650
are we good with the design, right? Now, I'm

907
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,219
gonna close this one

908
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,880
and then I'm gonna say, OK, looks good to me.

909
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,890
Now, if you see over here,

910
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:58,719
It's

911
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,088
OK, so now it says, let

912
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:04,348
me see what it is doing. OK, so it has,

913
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,130
perfect. Now I will create the implementation plan

914
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,709
with task. So that's the next step.

915
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:10,509
So until and unless that's

916
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:13,049
completed, it's still waiting for the

917
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:15,568
generous spec. That means the entire 3

918
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:16,920
steps that it has to complete,

919
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,858
uh, before it creates the hook for me. So

920
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:21,890
now if I hover over to the task list, which

921
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,328
is very interesting, where it gives you the granular

922
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,529
task, but if you see over here, it's gonna create

923
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:27,969
only 5 of them for me.

924
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:31,219
Because I've mentioned, OK, don't create more than 5

925
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:33,299
tasks, right? And if you see

926
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,118
there are some

927
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,380
that are not highlighted, which are

928
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,400
like optional tasks. So,

929
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:41,219
here, once the task list is created,

930
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,500
uh, you can see there are a couple of options.

931
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:45,930
One is the Keep optional tasks,

932
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,390
uh, that is faster in VP or make

933
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,559
all tasks required if you,

934
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,858
if I select this one,

935
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,348
all the non-highlighted ones also becomes

936
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:55,449
mandatory so all the task has to be,

937
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:57,430
uh, like executed

938
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,709
before even I start the application. But for the

939
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:00,449
time being

940
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:03,068
I'm not gonna, uh, do all the tasks.

941
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,108
I'm gonna just keep optional tasks so I hit

942
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:07,289
that and now it just tells,

943
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:07,828
OK.

944
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,157
Perfect. So now it is going to

945
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,039
do only the 5 steps that I mentioned, right?

946
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:15,989
And the optional testers are marked as a

947
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:19,259
star, so you can like skip them for a faster

948
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:19,768
MVP.

949
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,010
Now,

950
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,590
I can hover over here and I can

951
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,590
look into the first task. I can select

952
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,750
the thunder button next to the start task. It's

953
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,869
gonna start this task first

954
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,869
and then it, it is going to wait for me

955
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,949
to then once it is completed, go to the

956
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,949
next task, or else I can do

957
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:37,929
over here.

958
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:40,610
Execute.

959
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,918
Our tasks in

960
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:46,780
Sequence.

961
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:49,989
Now, if I do that,

962
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:51,168
you would see.

963
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,820
OK. Now, it started

964
00:34:54,478 --> 00:34:56,599
the first task, right? And you can like

965
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,219
look into view changes,

966
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,559
uh, what it is doing, which,

967
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,878
OK, still not yet. So, you can,

968
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:03,938
once it is

969
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:06,739
Started editing some existing.

970
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,478
OK, so.

971
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:09,789
Let's see.

972
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:12,559
It has executed. OK, now it has executed the hook,

973
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:14,898
which is the one that I mentioned. OK, the hook

974
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:16,898
is running right now. That means some of the,

975
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,260
if you see over here, which was interesting, uh,

976
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:20,840
it actually went in and

977
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,648
updated the game.

978
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,800
Dot JavaScript file. So

979
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,878
hence the auto unit testing

980
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,378
for the hook that I created that whenever it updates the

981
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:32,860
existing file it's gonna

982
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,378
uh execute the

983
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,878
specific hook to ensure that nothing

984
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:38,958
breaks, right? So it's still executing. I can look

985
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,199
into here. It's waiting for that

986
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,019
to execute.

987
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:45,989
And then it's still doing, yeah, and

988
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:48,179
this is a good point to point out when you create agent

989
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:48,688
hooks,

990
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,469
this is something we created that was very basic so that you

991
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:53,599
could see it in action, but in a, in

992
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,750
a real development mode you're gonna choose something that's

993
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,829
meaningful and impactful, uh, that's

994
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:58,728
going to,

995
00:35:58,989 --> 00:35:59,530
uh,

996
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,769
be appropriate for the amount of times it gets invoked

997
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:04,570
and the, um.

998
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,809
Second, uh, thing that I was gonna point out is you, you'll

999
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:08,429
notice there's

1000
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,849
broken up into tasks. One of the reasons you may

1001
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,378
not want to execute

1002
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:15,050
all tasks consistently on a larger

1003
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,168
effort is because we talked about a context

1004
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,349
window, and

1005
00:36:18,648 --> 00:36:20,829
these tasks, if you're going along,

1006
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,409
uh, you'll find that Kiro

1007
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:25,610
also keeps track of that context window

1008
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,728
and if you're doing a large or a long

1009
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,898
development. Uh, effort,

1010
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:31,849
it will stop that session,

1011
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,340
start a new context window, summarize it,

1012
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:35,039
compact

1013
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:37,539
what's in your context memory, and

1014
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,699
move it into a new session.

1015
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:39,708
So

1016
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,610
one of the things you can do with these tasks is

1017
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,110
usually or use them

1018
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,728
to break up your work, uh, whether it's

1019
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,849
because you've got a large project that has

1020
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:50,869
multiple chunks or because you want

1021
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,250
to break up your context window and

1022
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,250
have a clean window for another

1023
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,429
large task so that your context window

1024
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,750
is clean and works more efficiently

1025
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,128
for you, giving you better answers and getting

1026
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:03,449
faster processes.

1027
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,438
Yeah, when it does that, what does it do? It

1028
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,519
does. It, it brings over that summary and it

1029
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,639
brings those, uh, steering docks and the

1030
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,300
spec docs back into the new session. Yeah,

1031
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,800
that's right. And then, uh, talking about context window,

1032
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:20,119
right? So I just invoke the kiro CLI

1033
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,320
within the ID itself. So you just like

1034
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,679
run the kiro hyphen CLI in the terminal

1035
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,760
and then as Marcus mentioned,

1036
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,878
like you can check at runtime how

1037
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:31,000
much of context window you're using, right? So.

1038
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,110
You can just type like slash context and you can

1039
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,750
see, OK, I'm using like 12.8%

1040
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,809
of the entire 100% context window

1041
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:40,429
and then what are the different, uh, like

1042
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,949
areas that this context window is filling up, right?

1043
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,228
Uh, so you can see that on runtime and then

1044
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,300
like the other thing that is very

1045
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,849
important is like let's say the first task is

1046
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:51,989
completed, right, and it's still running the hook for me

1047
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:52,989
doing the unit testing.

1048
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,208
The first task, it addresses

1049
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,239
this requirements. So if you go to a requirements

1050
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,510
document and see the 1.1, 1.2,

1051
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,409
right, all these

1052
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,030
specific requirements, it is basically tackling

1053
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,228
through one single task, right? So

1054
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:08,228
it also gives you that granularity of like

1055
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:10,688
which requirements we are actually completing

1056
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,208
based on which task and then like.

1057
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:15,050
The other thing that is important is like the checkpointing

1058
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:17,389
that means like let's say right now it is doing an

1059
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:19,628
execute hook unit testing and

1060
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,628
then it has updated some of the like

1061
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:23,628
at the previous step it has updated some files.

1062
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,969
I want to like I probably have done something wrong,

1063
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:28,168
OK, or I want to like revert back.

1064
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:30,429
I have an option of restore. So if I select

1065
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:31,090
restore.

1066
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:32,958
Like I can just

1067
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:34,760
Remove those.

1068
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,599
I just.

1069
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,750
I can just

1070
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:41,878
OK. It's just,

1071
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,438
OK. It's just

1072
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,570
like, OK, so I think it did something

1073
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,000
wrong, but what I wanted to say is the restore

1074
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,500
option is like you want to like

1075
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
re-update the code base, OK, to the

1076
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,800
previous state you can do that by executing

1077
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,728
that restore button, right? OK,

1078
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:59,349
and let me stop this,

1079
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:00,699
uh, I think,

1080
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,648
let's see, OK, enable

1081
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,090
for the time being,

1082
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,239
but then.

1083
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,019
Let me open, uh,

1084
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:10,719
the other thing. OK. So, uh you mentioned

1085
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,340
about the

1086
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,619
Context

1087
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:16,119
window, let me bring that up.

1088
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,860
So this is

1089
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,760
Let me show you here.

1090
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,128
OK, here is the thing.

1091
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:26,519
Uh. I'm

1092
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,099
going to bring this one. So I was

1093
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,809
To your portion and let me enlarge

1094
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,978
it. Here's the thing.

1095
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,579
So, I was building a,

1096
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
let's say, a trading system, right? Uh,

1097
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,500
and I deployed it on AWS.

1098
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,840
Now, if you see over here,

1099
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:44,929
Uh, let me go here.

1100
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:48,179
This session was too long, right, for

1101
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,539
you, so it did the compaction,

1102
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,679
right? So it basically went through all the

1103
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,719
conversation history and then it created a new

1104
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:57,179
uh session for me, OK, with all

1105
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,639
the history for it. So it has created a new session

1106
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:02,179
over here and then it did the same

1107
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:02,719
thing like.

1108
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,789
If I go on the top like it again including the steering

1109
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:08,820
documents, so it came up. OK, I understood the

1110
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,349
previous context from your conversation we did the compaction

1111
00:40:11,668 --> 00:40:13,938
of the context window and then yeah, so

1112
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:16,099
it starts and while you're talking about this one in

1113
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,949
particular, it, it's another, uh,

1114
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,418
interesting call with Kiro. Those tabs each have their

1115
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,188
own context.

1116
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,679
So let's say you're working on something

1117
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,458
that's more in depth in one tab

1118
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:27,918
and you want to open up another tab but keep that

1119
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:29,579
context as clean as possible,

1120
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:32,320
you can open up another tab, just use haiku

1121
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,349
in it, for example,

1122
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,800
have a conversation about it, do some more planning,

1123
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,059
maybe create some more steering

1124
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,280
docks, more specs, more requirements, and

1125
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,478
then work them back into the other, but keeping

1126
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,849
the other context as clean as you, uh,

1127
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,889
can. Yeah.

1128
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,688
So, while that is like executing,

1129
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,969
OK, this is something that I already, like,

1130
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,909
for example,

1131
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,378
Built it, right, the same uh

1132
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:57,579
gaming application,

1133
00:40:57,938 --> 00:40:58,840
right? And

1134
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,208
What I did is that, OK.

1135
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,000
The other thing is very important is like if you

1136
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,039
are using any kind of git report, right, you want

1137
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,119
to commit. So I, the best practice

1138
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,159
that we typically uh uh advise

1139
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,458
is like whenever you have something which is,

1140
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:14,090
uh,

1141
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
a demoable solution, right,

1142
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,434
do more git commits, right? OK, connect. Twitter

1143
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:21,655
get report and do a commit, do an iterative,

1144
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:23,644
OK. If you think, OK, this is the right time to commit it,

1145
00:41:23,934 --> 00:41:26,635
uh, just commit it and then come back and, uh,

1146
00:41:26,644 --> 00:41:28,655
uh, like build on top of that, right, so that you don't

1147
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,655
lose the code base that you think you really like

1148
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,554
it. So that's another best practice, right?

1149
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:33,344
Uh,

1150
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:36,039
now. If you see over

1151
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,099
here, uh, let's see which, OK,

1152
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:42,039
so. Here's

1153
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,260
the one thing, right? So, let's see

1154
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,958
which one.

1155
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:47,659
This one, OK.

1156
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:48,539
So,

1157
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:50,938
it created a, so

1158
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,628
this, this is an existing uh gaming

1159
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:55,719
application, OK. It did all

1160
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,039
the advanced features that I mentioned

1161
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,418
and then if I open

1162
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:00,500
the.

1163
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,550
Gaming application with all the

1164
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,228
updates.

1165
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,340
And then if I bring it over

1166
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,360
here, I created a pack kilo,

1167
00:42:11,978 --> 00:42:12,679
and it

1168
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:15,099
has an ability to

1169
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,219
save the high scoring. It has

1170
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,869
those. Like trailing

1171
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,179
effects that I mentioned and all that. So

1172
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,519
I created this application in like maybe less

1173
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:26,619
than 20 minutes, right, uh, building that

1174
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:28,760
so I can like use VIP

1175
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,958
like, uh, spec-based coding, move from VIP

1176
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,219
coding for like doing proper planning,

1177
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,599
uh, approving all the requirements, design and

1178
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,019
task and everything, and then, uh,

1179
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:40,300
that's how like you build like any kind of production

1180
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,429
ready application which is, uh, and then the

1181
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,510
final thing is like the AWS deployment,

1182
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,769
right? So if you see over here, uh,

1183
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,079
in this one.

1184
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:49,989
If I go back here,

1185
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:52,250
I know, page.

1186
00:42:53,668 --> 00:42:54,849
I'm struggling. OK.

1187
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:56,110
So,

1188
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:58,000
I did, like I told, OK,

1189
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,570
even Quiro, right? I asked, OK, can you create

1190
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,668
an AWS cost analysis because

1191
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:04,668
I'm very concerned about cost. OK, tell me, like if there

1192
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,719
are 10,000 users right now, OK,

1193
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,938
using this application when it is deployed, uh,

1194
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,070
on AWS,

1195
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:12,789
how would that look like? So it created an executive summary

1196
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,369
for me. Right?

1197
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,728
Something like this. So it went in and

1198
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,809
looked into all the uh

1199
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,369
infrastructure that it is using for

1200
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:22,570
hosting this application,

1201
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:25,050
and then it did a cost breakdown

1202
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,369
by service. So it created a very detailed

1203
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:29,398
analysis of like cost analysis.

1204
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,389
The other thing is, uh,

1205
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,119
I asked him, OK,

1206
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:34,429
can you create,

1207
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,269
like if I ask here.

1208
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,458
Can you

1209
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:40,750
create

1210
00:43:42,188 --> 00:43:42,840
Uh,

1211
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:44,489
AWS,

1212
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:48,128
uh, I think it is too small, right? So architecture.

1213
00:43:49,398 --> 00:43:51,978
Diagram using AWS.

1214
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:54,360
Diagram

1215
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:56,949
Server.

1216
00:43:58,148 --> 00:44:00,179
So this is something like, OK, I have built the

1217
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,570
application, but I want to create an architecture diagram, right? So

1218
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:05,349
it says, OK, I'll create an architecture

1219
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,590
diagram for you for the Pack hero game.

1220
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:10,300
Now what it is doing is that it is using the MCP

1221
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,590
tools. So here you have the diagram MCP

1222
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,708
server. So it is taking all the icons

1223
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:15,489
from there

1224
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:16,369
and then.

1225
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:19,570
is creating an architecture diagram for

1226
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,250
me. And then

1227
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:22,760
It's gonna wait

1228
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,128
for me and then, OK, I want to allow it

1229
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:26,429
to generate the diagram.

1230
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,860
So you can like, so this is something more of

1231
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,099
a runtime, OK, where you're not like putting

1232
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:33,139
everything into the context, but you are like

1233
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:35,579
calling on runtime some of the additional

1234
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,619
external tools, right? And then the

1235
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:39,739
other thing if you see over here, there's another

1236
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:41,000
option here

1237
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,519
which is the

1238
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,639
hash button, right? So.

1239
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:47,780
OK, there is.

1240
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:51,159
My screen froze on me

1241
00:44:51,378 --> 00:44:52,418
for some, OK,

1242
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,179
interesting. My screen froze on me, but

1243
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:56,019
then let me.

1244
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:57,610
So generated,

1245
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,500
if you see over here, this is a folder. It

1246
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,179
created an

1247
00:45:01,478 --> 00:45:03,500
architecture diagram for me. Let me bring

1248
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,340
to this one.

1249
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:06,889
OK, that's a nice

1250
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:08,449
small

1251
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:10,219
architecture diagram

1252
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,590
that it has created using the diagram server,

1253
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,849
right? Now,

1254
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,909
I don't know. I cannot.

1255
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:19,559
You, OK, here is this, so

1256
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,599
you, if you type hash

1257
00:45:21,898 --> 00:45:23,000
and then there are like

1258
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:25,570
certain additional context that you can inject, like

1259
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,659
let's say I have this URL and I

1260
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,989
can reference the URL like, OK, I have an external

1261
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:30,628
URL

1262
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:31,878
something like

1263
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,019
example.com and then look

1264
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:35,829
into that.

1265
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:38,829
Look into this

1266
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:40,050
gaming.

1267
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:41,869
Application

1268
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:43,349
and come up with a

1269
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,369
Comparison of the feature set that I want to utilize

1270
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,159
so you can

1271
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:50,119
like use peg-based coding and the

1272
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,228
conversation with that using some additional

1273
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:54,610
tools that is there within the kiro agenttic ID

1274
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,809
uh to do some kind of additional analysis

1275
00:45:57,809 --> 00:45:58,639
use, uh,

1276
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:01,010
so, so that's kind of something which is very

1277
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,398
interesting, right? uh.

1278
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,418
Yeah, I think pretty much

1279
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:08,159
that's all any questions so far based on the ID?

1280
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,188
Yup, good.

1281
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,070
A bit of a question between the specs and the steering.

1282
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:15,898
Show here we had a very fairly simple demo

1283
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,469
here

1284
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:19,070
but in a more mature application you see those getting

1285
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,929
quite longer. So

1286
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,659
yeah, so the question is pretty simple

1287
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,820
application. The steering and the spec docs

1288
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,019
here pretty small.

1289
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,500
What does the context window look like when you

1290
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,668
add. A larger project

1291
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:35,869
you're doing a significant refactor

1292
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:38,320
of an enterprise application. What happens?

1293
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,708
So that's when you start talking more

1294
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,918
about. Uh, you will have multiple

1295
00:46:42,918 --> 00:46:45,570
phases. You break the whole project into phases,

1296
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,728
uh, is one piece,

1297
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,199
and I'll, I'll come back and bring it together in more detail.

1298
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:50,019
Uh,

1299
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:52,898
Pranjeet showed how some of these rules

1300
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,079
and these, uh,

1301
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:55,300
steering docks

1302
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,918
are listed as always. You've got other

1303
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,739
options. Don't always include them,

1304
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,019
uh, and also, so when you've got

1305
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:04,800
multiple phases of a project, you can have different

1306
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,878
specs. So I've got one example that

1307
00:47:06,878 --> 00:47:07,938
has 10 different

1308
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,289
specs. And each spec has its

1309
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,429
own set of requirements,

1310
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,188
uh,

1311
00:47:13,938 --> 00:47:15,668
design, and tasks.

1312
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,628
An example, uh,

1313
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:19,148
I could have

1314
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,590
the, or I, I've got, um,

1315
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,079
a particular enhancement. I've got a feature, a new

1316
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,250
feature. I got an MVP first that took,

1317
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,570
you know, two specs. Then I'm like, OK, this is

1318
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:29,958
great for an MVP. Everybody loved it.

1319
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:32,449
Let's do some feature enhancements. Call it sprint 1,

1320
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:33,610
sprint 2, whatever you've got.

1321
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:36,079
And then so you build that in there and

1322
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,119
you create a spec doc for that set of feature

1323
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,539
enhancements. I've got another

1324
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,219
spec doc where

1325
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,780
I added a feature,

1326
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,860
and I really want that feature but it broke some stuff.

1327
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:48,119
So now I've got another spec

1328
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,699
instead of um.

1329
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,820
Design and implementation tasks that

1330
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,398
go back and help me

1331
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,219
uh refactor

1332
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:58,978
that piece and so that's how

1333
00:47:58,978 --> 00:48:00,958
you would do it now getting back to the context window.

1334
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:02,949
Uh, if you haven't found it

1335
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:06,208
before in your AI uses, uh, model.gov,

1336
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:08,809
it gives you a list of all of the different models

1337
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:10,958
that are, I don't know if it's all, but most

1338
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,309
of the models that are out there, you can see, uh,

1339
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:15,728
approximate price per million tokens.

1340
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,510
You can see

1341
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:18,510
size of the context window,

1342
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:19,889
and when you look at that,

1343
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:21,188
try to match

1344
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,389
the model

1345
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:24,500
with the work that you're doing,

1346
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:26,849
because, yeah, it, it what could you

1347
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:29,239
do a context, uh, show like, uh,

1348
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,219
back in the KOCLI.

1349
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,389
Do you guys have like a

1350
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,478
Is there like a good ratio to shoot for?

1351
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,840
We were talking about ratios and that's, it's

1352
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,849
interesting and, and I, it may not answer. So the

1353
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:41,989
question was, is there a ratio we shoot for?

1354
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,849
Um, uh, what I was gonna say is the context

1355
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,110
show. You'll

1356
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,110
notice now I'm not getting just

1357
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:54,070
how much is used per category. I'm actually

1358
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,369
seeing what files

1359
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,869
are being used. That gives you a better idea of what's

1360
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,148
being used and what goes into it. Do I really need this?

1361
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,889
So, um, ratio,

1362
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:03,728
uh,

1363
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:06,418
the ratio that we found, uh, is

1364
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:08,349
it could range when you're creating code.

1365
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:10,369
You could have a simple,

1366
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:11,449
uh,

1367
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,849
you know, generate a spec for doing

1368
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:15,679
an enterprise billing solution.

1369
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:18,030
It could be 1 to 100. You

1370
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,070
could do what Pranjit was doing, which is a little more

1371
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,510
detailed, and, and constrain

1372
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,619
it, and it's more of a 1 to 10, 1

1373
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:26,820
to 20. But one thing you'll find just in general

1374
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:29,570
context ratios or or token ratios

1375
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,909
into input output. Is that what you're getting at is inputs and

1376
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:33,389
outputs? OK, so input.

1377
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:35,000
Uh, generating code

1378
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,039
1 to 10 to 1 to 100 depending upon

1379
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:41,360
things. Um, if you're doing translation,

1380
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,199
uh, 1 to 1, if you're doing

1381
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,519
something along the lines of

1382
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,099
a summarization, it might be just the opposite. I've

1383
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:50,119
got 100 to 1 or 10 to 1 where I'm giving

1384
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:51,938
it this and say summarize this for me.

1385
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,500
So it's an inverse of that, um, just

1386
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,398
general Q&A

1387
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,820
1 to 31 to 5. I ask a question, you

1388
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,010
give me. Some degree of concise

1389
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,050
or verbose answer, but in

1390
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,750
for what we're talking about code development, it could range

1391
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:05,628
from

1392
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,849
a 1 to 10 to 1 to 100

1393
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:08,860
ratio,

1394
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,159
depending upon things like steering docks, constraints,

1395
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,168
and how you prompt it.

1396
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,179
Yeah, it's typically like, uh, if you input like

1397
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,378
I've seen like at least for Kido like or

1398
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,500
some other tools like it's like 100 input token,

1399
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:22,820
you get 1 output token, right? So that's

1400
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,898
the reason, right? Like we consider

1401
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,978
context window as the real estate that you

1402
00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:29,019
want to utilize it efficiently because like

1403
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:31,019
you don't want to dump everything within the context and

1404
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:33,090
like think like it's gonna create something wonderful for you,

1405
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,139
right? So very like important how

1406
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:37,289
you want to utilize the context window. That's why like

1407
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:39,539
this key OCL and the tools that you have is like

1408
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,809
showing you those how you're utilizing the context

1409
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:43,864
window and how you can like. Are you nearing to the

1410
00:50:43,864 --> 00:50:45,985
compaction and things like that? You can do it

1411
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:47,985
even up front, OK, like using some of the commands

1412
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:50,023
like slash Compact and all that, right? So

1413
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:50,864
yeah, that's important.

1414
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:51,945
Now, uh,

1415
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:54,474
like, as I mentioned, like I was just showing

1416
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:56,625
like when you guys were having a conversation, a trading system

1417
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,885
that I built, right? OK, so you can build like

1418
00:50:59,063 --> 00:51:01,264
this is just for like the time of that

1419
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:03,264
we have like an hour, OK, how we can showcase

1420
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:05,264
some of the features and some of the tools

1421
00:51:05,264 --> 00:51:07,264
that are there within the kiro agentic

1422
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,523
ID, OK, which will help you from a context

1423
00:51:09,523 --> 00:51:11,625
engineering side of it. Right now we have gone

1424
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,699
through this like just. A summary of what we

1425
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,208
went over,

1426
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,550
uh, we use like white coding to

1427
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,570
start the ideation phase, then we moved to the

1428
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,739
spec-based coding, and then we, uh,

1429
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,909
like it created the user stories and acceptance

1430
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:24,469
criteria at the requirements phase,

1431
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,750
uh, just like any SDLC process, we call it

1432
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,829
AIDLC or artificial intelligence

1433
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:29,688
DLC, right?

1434
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,110
Uh, and then the design phase is where you're gonna

1435
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:34,188
look into all the architecture diagram,

1436
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:36,458
the mermaid flow, the, the system architecture,

1437
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,668
and everything, and then, uh, once you are

1438
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:40,750
fine with those, you move to the task which can

1439
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,309
be more granular.

1440
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,793
And whether you have like additional

1441
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:46,353
optional task as well which you can make them uh

1442
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,074
like mandatory,

1443
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,635
right? And there's one very important thing that was

1444
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:51,405
uh like after it went GA

1445
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:54,184
uh just a few weeks back, uh,

1446
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,235
a property-based testing or PBT which

1447
00:51:56,235 --> 00:51:58,333
is basically not just unit testing

1448
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,514
of just a specific module that you have developed

1449
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:02,594
with agentic ID but making

1450
00:52:02,594 --> 00:52:04,875
sure like if you're doing some code update or

1451
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,204
creating new code, is it gonna, uh,

1452
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,514
go back and look into the requirements document

1453
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:11,559
and see like if it is. Like aligning to

1454
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,628
what you initially said to build, right, so

1455
00:52:13,628 --> 00:52:15,030
the property based testing is something,

1456
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:15,938
uh, it

1457
00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:18,599
talks about like correctness property, and then it's basically

1458
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,599
embedded within the design markdown

1459
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,639
file where you go scroll all the way down. It

1460
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,099
shows all the property based testing. Like these are the property

1461
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,458
testing that is aligned to these requirements,

1462
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,519
and it's gonna check those OK at certain interval

1463
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:30,139
based on what,

1464
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,519
uh, you're building, right, using some of the tasks.

1465
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,679
So that those are the important thing. And then you come up

1466
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:36,489
with a working product. Now

1467
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,239
some of the advantages both for developers

1468
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,514
and for the. Organizations like, uh,

1469
00:52:41,523 --> 00:52:43,664
you reduce time for fixing some of the

1470
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:45,175
code that you generate through AI,

1471
00:52:45,764 --> 00:52:47,844
uh, you build production ready solutions from

1472
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:50,264
day one rather than just like, uh,

1473
00:52:50,485 --> 00:52:52,523
prompting and praying something good comes out. You

1474
00:52:52,523 --> 00:52:54,594
become a context architect, not just a code reviewer,

1475
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:56,583
right? So you're gonna use your own,

1476
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,164
uh, knowledge, right, that you have acquired

1477
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:01,324
from so long working on different tools and

1478
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:03,344
technologies and frameworks, right? So

1479
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:05,724
that's very important. That's not gonna go away. And

1480
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,003
also how you can use like if you're building on AWS,

1481
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,769
the best practices. Like I've shown some of the MCP

1482
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:12,969
server. There are like more like cost related

1483
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,030
MCP server. There's like, uh,

1484
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,329
like cloud formation, uh, MCP

1485
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:19,329
server and all those things. Like there's like more than

1486
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,010
50 of them already out there, right?

1487
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,369
Uh, and then from the organization, OK, you're

1488
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:25,648
not, they're not gonna get a very big AWS

1489
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:26,648
bill just because like,

1490
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:29,199
uh, uh, AI code didn't even, uh, uh,

1491
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,289
like understand the cost implications of

1492
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:33,289
like is it building something like

1493
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:35,329
is it like spinning up big containers or you see

1494
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:37,228
to instances, things like that, right? So very

1495
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,574
important, and then. Now the security and compliance

1496
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:41,894
like mostly for financial industry, insurance

1497
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:44,144
industry, how you're dealing with PHI PII

1498
00:53:44,144 --> 00:53:46,293
data, right? Are there any other government

1499
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,375
standards that it has to adhere to, right? You

1500
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,614
can do those vibe coding and the spec-based

1501
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:52,684
coding. You can like have that conversation and

1502
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:54,735
like make sure those are like embedded within the markdown

1503
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:56,594
files or add those phases

1504
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:59,054
before even it starts coding. So plan before you

1505
00:53:59,054 --> 00:54:00,313
build, right? That's kind of the idea.

1506
00:54:00,853 --> 00:54:03,273
And then, uh, faster time to market and,

1507
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:05,534
uh, the tech debt, right? Like when you do vibe

1508
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,820
coding, OK, you gather a lot of like. Technical

1509
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,938
debt because like there's a lot of unnecessary code that

1510
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:12,219
is not needed, right? So how you can

1511
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:14,300
improve that and reduce some of the tech. So

1512
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,539
those are some of the benefits for the

1513
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:18,619
organizations and this is something that I wanted

1514
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:20,739
to highlight like Andres Karpati, you probably know

1515
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:23,179
the founder of OpenAI, one of the co-founder, has

1516
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:25,329
mentioned in one of his session LLMs

1517
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:27,719
are the new CPUs, which is more of like

1518
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,300
context processing units. So context is very important

1519
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,300
and how you move from prompt engineering

1520
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,300
to the context engineering is a new era

1521
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,550
that we are gonna go into right next year. So.

1522
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:37,478
Uh,

1523
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:40,019
as I mentioned, some of the resources, this is,

1524
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,340
these are some of the QR codes. Please take a

1525
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,199
picture if you want.

1526
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,539
The first one is very, uh, interesting, which is like

1527
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:47,539
the context engineering versus white coding, when to

1528
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:49,559
use what. It's not and or or.

1529
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,619
It's basically based on your use

1530
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:53,780
case. OK, if you're building a quick prototype for going

1531
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,000
into a, uh, uh, uh, a meeting,

1532
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,978
OK, where you want to just show the art of the possible,

1533
00:54:58,449 --> 00:55:00,574
probably why coding is the. A way to go. But if you're

1534
00:55:00,574 --> 00:55:02,644
planning to build a production with the application, it's not

1535
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:03,605
the right step, right?

1536
00:55:03,894 --> 00:55:06,215
Uh, the Quiro website to get started, how you can download

1537
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:08,335
and set up your workspaces, and

1538
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:10,815
then this is an interesting workshop, like AI-driven

1539
00:55:10,815 --> 00:55:12,815
dev with Quiro workshop. It takes you to the

1540
00:55:12,815 --> 00:55:14,815
workshop of the AWS where you can like actually

1541
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:15,465
do hands-on,

1542
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,894
how you can use white coding spec based

1543
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:20,135
on some of the other additional resources that I shared

1544
00:55:20,135 --> 00:55:21,335
today, like some of the additional features.

1545
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:23,632
Uh, and with that,

1546
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:26,371
I think we come to the conclusion this is, uh, our

1547
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:28,431
email address if you want to connect or

1548
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:30,851
happy, uh, like connect over LinkedIn and

1549
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:32,931
please, uh, like feedback is a gift. So

1550
00:55:32,931 --> 00:55:35,052
if there's anything that we can improve upon, if there's

1551
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:36,271
anything that we didn't

1552
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,601
meet your expectations based on the sessions that we have,

1553
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,771
please feel free to give your honest feedback, right?

1554
00:55:40,931 --> 00:55:42,971
So yeah, any questions if you

1555
00:55:42,971 --> 00:55:43,632
have some time.

1556
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:50,829
Gives you microservices

1557
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:57,000
and you're just getting started

1558
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,449
over there. What are some steps that

1559
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:00,550
you should follow

1560
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:01,989
for existing.

1561
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:05,539
Yeah, so that, so let me rephrase

1562
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:07,909
for the audiences, for someone who is going to offline,

1563
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,099
uh, hear this, uh, the question is

1564
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:12,340
basically what about the legacy applications, right? Like

1565
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,320
how do we modernize or how do you like

1566
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,559
start you like

1567
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,219
playing with those and like modernize this was the same

1568
00:56:18,219 --> 00:56:19,739
question I was having with someone else like.

1569
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:22,199
There's a use case over here, OK? It's just

1570
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:24,360
one, like two patterns that we have showed here. They're

1571
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,679
like 100 types of patterns.

1572
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,188
So one of the patterns that I have seen is like there is a,

1573
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,398
and just to give an example, uh, legacy

1574
00:56:30,398 --> 00:56:31,030
Java application,

1575
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,659
right, that's been running for like 1015 years

1576
00:56:33,878 --> 00:56:36,119
with some outdated Java version, some of the

1577
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:37,750
security challenges, right?

1578
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,438
So there was this use case where like the stakeholders

1579
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,478
are really concerned and they want to migrate

1580
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:43,949
to a more modern architecture,

1581
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,489
but it's a lot of significant

1582
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:48,559
investment for the key resources, probably the developers

1583
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,791
that have built. OK, have left the organization, right?

1584
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,282
So how do you like squeeze that time frame

1585
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:54,112
and use Quiro,

1586
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:56,682
right, to give that code base, like

1587
00:56:56,682 --> 00:56:58,782
point to the code base and then let it

1588
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:01,041
like use the spec-based coding to come up with

1589
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,163
that modern cloud native, like if it is cloud

1590
00:57:03,163 --> 00:57:05,242
is the right way, uh, come up with the

1591
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:07,271
discovery and the analysis part of it

1592
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:09,282
and what would be the to be architecture so you can

1593
00:57:09,282 --> 00:57:11,402
do all that roadmap analysis and come up

1594
00:57:11,402 --> 00:57:11,981
with that,

1595
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,342
uh, plan, uh, in a detailed fashion, OK,

1596
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:16,521
which you can use like once you get approval from

1597
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:18,686
your stakeholders to kind of then. Start

1598
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:21,005
building on like uh small task

1599
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,045
or sublevel task on addressing some of the specific

1600
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:25,284
components within the legacy application to

1601
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:27,405
move to a more modern cloud native architecture

1602
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:29,405
at like it's like a crawl walk

1603
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,445
runs process right that we typically follow. So

1604
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:33,565
there's use case over there, OK, we have

1605
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:35,755
workshops of how you can get started

1606
00:57:35,755 --> 00:57:38,005
on dealing with some of the legacy

1607
00:57:38,005 --> 00:57:40,125
applications and how you can use that, uh, key

1608
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:40,945
road to kind of,

1609
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:43,385
uh, build modern architecture and like,

1610
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:45,666
uh, like modernize the legacy

1611
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,445
applications. So there are use cases around that as well.

1612
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,958
OK. If I can add

1613
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:50,820
my 2 cents,

1614
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:52,500
agree with everything he just said,

1615
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,860
but I got 2 minutes. I think I can, I can enhance it.

1616
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:02,958
Yep, Greenfield's

1617
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:05,039
really easy, right? It's the brown field that you got

1618
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:06,148
to do a little more work on it.

1619
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:08,780
So you've got an enterprise architecture diagram, right?

1620
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,978
I, or if not,

1621
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,389
make one, or he'll I have, have Claude

1622
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,639
Kiro help you, but Claude is multi

1623
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:17,250
or Kiro's multimodal.

1624
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:19,918
So you can take a picture or an image

1625
00:58:19,918 --> 00:58:21,320
of that enterprise diagram,

1626
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:22,340
feed it in.

1627
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,300
And then start at that level

1628
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,918
and then, you know,

1629
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,809
provide anything you want about your microservices architecture.

1630
00:58:28,918 --> 00:58:31,250
Do you wanna change everything? Are you, uh,

1631
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,079
updating for versions, etc.

1632
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:35,519
but something you can go back to your hotel room

1633
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:37,559
tonight, get the diagram, feed it

1634
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,168
into Quiro

1635
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,938
as an image and say help me develop

1636
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:41,860
a solution,

1637
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:44,668
uh, for updating, upgrading,

1638
00:58:44,878 --> 00:58:46,349
refactoring, whatever you need to do.

1639
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:48,958
Start from there, work your way down into the details,

1640
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,559
you break up each one of those microservices into its own

1641
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:52,239
set of specs.

1642
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,878
All right. If there's any

1643
00:58:57,878 --> 00:58:59,889
questions, we'll wrap up here, but thank you

1644
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:02,260
again for staying with us. Hopefully, it was helpful.

1645
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:03,800
And yeah, thank you.
