1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:01,429
Good morning

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:04,250
and welcome to day 5 at Reinvent.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,849
I want to begin by thanking you for choosing

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,550
to spend your Friday morning with us.

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,739
I know you're a very passionate bunch. It

6
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,849
is the only possible explanation to spend

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,958
your Friday morning

8
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:18,609
listening to Web 3,

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,329
payment protocols, digital assets,

10
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:22,719
payments,

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,260
and agenting payment.

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,129
I don't know if I would have made it here, but I applaud

13
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:27,908
the curiosity.

14
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,568
In addition to being grateful,

15
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,228
I'm very excited today. I'm excited because

16
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,709
we're joined by our customer Coinbase,

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,389
who will also share their journey with

18
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,189
Agentic payments on AWS.

19
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:44,740
Before I begin,

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,079
I would like to understand a little bit about

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,118
the mix we have here in the audience. I

22
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:50,679
walked around and talked to some of you,

23
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,240
and seemed like some of you had some background on

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,500
Web 3 and some don't.

25
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:56,840
It'll help me understand who has, you know, the,

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,079
the mix of the crowd so I know how much time I can spend on

27
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,139
that. Can I see a show of hands?

28
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,840
How many of you are actually building actively

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,558
on Web 3?

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,028
OK, very few. So I will spend a

31
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,189
little bit of time giving an overview on web

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,189
3 and digital assets,

33
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,980
so you get a deeper understanding of the topics

34
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,948
that are set to follow.

35
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,918
OK, my name is Arvind,

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,159
and I will be jointly presenting this

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,739
session

38
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,579
with Joshua Smith,

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,278
senior solutions architect at AWS,

40
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,638
and Eric Rappel,

41
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,278
head of engineering Coinbase development platform

42
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:32,120
at Coinbase.

43
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,209
So what are we going to talk about today?

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,948
I'm gonna start by giving you an overview

45
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:42,269
of Web 3 as promised.

46
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,799
I will spend a little bit more time than I originally

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,138
planned to so I can set the stage for you

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,750
on what is Web 3,

49
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:51,439
how does AWS see it? What is our perspective

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
on Web 3, what are some of the workloads,

51
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,109
how do we address the requirements of these workloads,

52
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,599
and what do we have planned as we move forward.

53
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
We will then segue from there

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,528
into what digital assets can do

55
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,349
for payments

56
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:06,808
and why they matter.

57
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,737
After which Eric will come on stage and

58
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:11,907
talk to you about

59
00:02:12,237 --> 00:02:13,288
X 402,

60
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,187
an open source payment protocol.

61
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,538
And that will be followed by Josh's

62
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,778
talk on how to implement

63
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:24,278
agentic payments on AWS leveraging

64
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,879
AWS's foundational capabilities.

65
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,270
With X402 that Eric

66
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,969
talked to you about prior to that

67
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,330
sound good to you?

68
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,389
OK, so that's what to expect from the session. This

69
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,469
is a 300 level session. So in addition to

70
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,508
the overview I'm about to give you for the

71
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:41,409
people who are curious,

72
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,669
we will get a little deeper into the code

73
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:44,868
and into the implementation.

74
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,118
All right, so,

75
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,740
web 3, what does web 3 at AWS look like?

76
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
What's our perspective?

77
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,058
When I say web 3,

78
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,520
how many of you immediately think cryptocurrency?

79
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,219
Now I see more hands go up,

80
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,429
right? For good reason.

81
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,788
Crypto has been

82
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,399
probably the most popular use case

83
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,409
over the last 10 years for web 3.

84
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,330
So when we say blockchain, when we say web 3.

85
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,939
People immediately think crypto.

86
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,558
I'm here to tell you that our view of

87
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,599
Web 3 extends far beyond

88
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,179
crypto.

89
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,250
There are a lot more use cases

90
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:27,629
that take advantage of the same

91
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,710
foundational principles that

92
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,830
underpin Web 3.

93
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,118
Crypto is just one of it.

94
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,219
There are many decentralized applications.

95
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,969
That take advantage of these different

96
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:43,169
technologies that we're going to touch on today.

97
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,099
Web 3 came about in response

98
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,838
to the perceived shortcomings of the

99
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:53,699
current internet infrastructure,

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,899
with the core tenet being

101
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,139
decentralization.

102
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,308
There are a variety of decentralized technologies

103
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,389
that need to come together for you to

104
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,949
operationalize a web 3 workload.

105
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,028
Blockchain networks,

106
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,429
decentralized storage networks,

107
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:14,368
virtual machines for smart contract execution.

108
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,358
So if you're thinking about an actual

109
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,538
use case or a workload,

110
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,069
say, to bring a digital asset to life, oftentimes

111
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,658
you're pulling together a lot of these decentralized

112
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:27,677
technologies.

113
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,559
To operationalize a single workload.

114
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,629
That's really how it all comes together, and

115
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:35,790
when you do that,

116
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:37,949
you have a lot of choices to make.

117
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:41,459
And we at AWS are here to

118
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,720
provide you with the prescriptive guidance you need.

119
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:46,600
To build these workloads and deploy them

120
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,399
at scale.

121
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,959
So when you think about building a web 3 product,

122
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,420
using decentralized technology

123
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,619
is not the goal.

124
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,379
It is just a means to an end.

125
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,959
At the end of the day, you're looking to build

126
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,699
the product.

127
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:08,579
So in many ways it's incumbent on us to make

128
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,850
sure we're providing you with the right building blocks

129
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,678
so you can take advantage of these technologies

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,399
and build the product you need.

131
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,858
We are in the business of providing these primitives

132
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:21,019
of these building blocks so you can build the Web 3

133
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:21,579
products.

134
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:23,579
We don't build the web 3 products for you.

135
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:24,869
You're doing that.

136
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,509
What we do

137
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,970
is bring all of these foundational technologies

138
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,209
and primitives so you can go and

139
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,250
operationalize these workloads.

140
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:34,689
But as you go about doing this,

141
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,750
taking all of these decentralized technologies and

142
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,970
building that web 3 product.

143
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,170
Can quite often look like the squiggly

144
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,689
curve you're seeing on the screen.

145
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,298
And that is so because you have a lot of choices

146
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:47,970
to make.

147
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,199
A lot of components to take advantage of

148
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,798
to pull together a single solution.

149
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,100
The most foundational choices you will make.

150
00:05:59,129 --> 00:05:59,949
are around

151
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,548
first choosing the right.

152
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,850
Right foundation to build your products.

153
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,278
Are you gonna use a public

154
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,019
or a permission chain?

155
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:12,899
And are you going to use use a mix

156
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,600
of both,

157
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,298
which public protocol are you gonna choose? Are

158
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,319
you going to choose multiple different protocols?

159
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:19,379
And if you do that,

160
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,829
are you going to have to build interoperability?

161
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,028
And now if you're talking about assets,

162
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,559
are you going to, are you going to provide custodial

163
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,559
solutions or non-custodial solutions?

164
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,619
How are you going to handle your smart contract execution?

165
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,600
What kind of standards are you going to use there?

166
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,379
These are all topics that you may or may not be familiar

167
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,379
with, and these are a lot of different choices to

168
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,579
make. And once you've gone

169
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,649
past these foundational core components,

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,959
then you get into

171
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,939
other choices you have to make.

172
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,199
How are you going to handle

173
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,290
your blockchain data? How are you going to do the analytics?

174
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,488
There's on chain data. There's off chain data. How

175
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,079
are you going to bring it all together

176
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,459
to make the choices that you have to make when

177
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,259
you build your product?

178
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,858
How are you going to build your wallet? Are you going to build it?

179
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:03,678
Are are you gonna buy it?

180
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,259
And of course

181
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,858
if you're involved in the

182
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,238
digital assets business, are you gonna be an

183
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,358
issuer? Are, are you gonna take care of that yourself

184
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:14,379
or are you gonna, are you gonna leverage somebody else

185
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:14,980
to do that

186
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:17,278
and go off to build the product you

187
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,449
need so you can remove the heavy lifting from yourself?

188
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,079
These are very big choices to make because

189
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,160
they inform how the business

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,480
is gonna progress from there.

191
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,100
And this is where we come in.

192
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,988
With the approach that we have taken for web

193
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:34,540
3,

194
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
we take that squiggly curve you saw and

195
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,379
do our best to make it

196
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:40,319
that straight line you're seeing on your screen.

197
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,199
And we are doing that with our 3 foundational

198
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,798
pillars.

199
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:47,350
Manage services,

200
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,709
do it-yourself Web 3 solutions,

201
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,730
and a very robust partner ecosystem

202
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,129
that we have built around Web 3.

203
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,088
Let's start with managed services first.

204
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,449
If you're looking to build your own products

205
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,528
on AWS,

206
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,819
You could take advantage of all of the primitives,

207
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:09,119
all of the building blocks that we have today.

208
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:12,309
And operationalize your solutions. You

209
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,470
could do it all by yourself if you chose to do it.

210
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,019
It is a lot of work, but it's doable.

211
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,879
All you have to do is take advantage of some of the core

212
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,660
infrastructure.

213
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,819
Products that we have and we help you build it.

214
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,358
Now from an infrastructure perspective,

215
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,889
let's focus a little bit on on EC

216
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,170
2. I do have lambda and other logos

217
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,219
over there, but I'll take a minute to talk about EC-2

218
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,509
here. One

219
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,048
of the core tenets, as I talked about earlier, is decentralization.

220
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,330
Decentralization does not mean

221
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,070
you don't run on the cloud.

222
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,479
It only means you're decentralizing the

223
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,359
authority or the decision making.

224
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:50,899
Now when you're thinking about running nodes, blockchain

225
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,558
nodes on the cloud.

226
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,379
AWS

227
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,798
offers you

228
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:58,330
a certain assurance by default,

229
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,859
which is there is no operator

230
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,058
access to any customer content on any

231
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:05,619
nitro-based instance that's running on AWS.

232
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,139
So now if you step back and think about one of the

233
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,379
big things that probably drove

234
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,830
you to think about decentralization,

235
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,019
it's about that access to data. It's about the ownership.

236
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,038
And with AWS, if you're spinning up an

237
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,729
EC2 instance and running it

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,190
by default,

239
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,000
there is no mechanism for any AWS

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
operator to access your content.

241
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,090
So your content remains protected.

242
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,460
It is perhaps one of the best reasons

243
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,840
as to why you should run

244
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,500
your blockchain nodes on AWS.

245
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,239
There are other components as well from storage

246
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,379
and security. I'll touch a little bit on security now.

247
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,129
If you're building custody solutions, I highly

248
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,440
encourage you to think about specialized

249
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,298
capabilities that we have built

250
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,779
specifically to address these web 3 custody

251
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:52,590
solutions.

252
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,580
AWS Nitro Enclaves.

253
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,500
It's the foundational

254
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,178
foundational component

255
00:09:58,469 --> 00:09:59,820
for confidential compute.

256
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:02,200
On these wallet solutions.

257
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,500
And if you're using enclaves, you're

258
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,918
perhaps using a key store

259
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,298
to bring your keys to decrypt them within

260
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:12,019
the enclave to manage the keys, assign your transactions.

261
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,779
We have products like AWS KMS

262
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:15,668
and cloud HSM

263
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,168
that allow you to do that.

264
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,830
And I'm more than happy to take questions about it after

265
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,558
the session

266
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,950
we can deep dive into what that looks like on

267
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,808
AWS.

268
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:26,349
I'm just leaving you

269
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,649
with some components and products to think about

270
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,330
as you as you start thinking about these specific

271
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:31,869
solutions.

272
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:35,750
In addition to managed services, we also provide

273
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,298
certain do it-yourself solutions.

274
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,178
These are not production grade, but these help you hit

275
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:40,859
the ground running.

276
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:43,629
We have built what's called AWS Blockchain

277
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,250
Node Runners. It's an open source project.

278
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,229
We have blueprints for several popular

279
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:49,859
protocols on node runners,

280
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,250
and this helps you

281
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,989
spin up your own blockchain nodes on AWS.

282
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,190
So if you're looking to self-manage your

283
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,229
nodes, if you're not using a provider to

284
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,019
do it for you,

285
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:01,469
you could directly use EC2 to

286
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:03,210
spin up your blockchain nodes on AWS,

287
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:05,219
and Node runners helps you do that.

288
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,629
It provides you with the blueprints, and

289
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,710
we continue to add popular protocols

290
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,489
to node runners.

291
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,029
So if there are protocols that you care about, you don't

292
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:13,950
see it in our report.

293
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,710
Talk to me. Send me a note.

294
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,950
We'll at it.

295
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:21,158
Right? Another solution is

296
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:22,399
around blockchain wallets.

297
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,759
We, we've been working with blockchain wallets

298
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,859
for 4 to 5 years now, so we,

299
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:29,149
we have a lot of knowledge on this. We have a lot of

300
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,200
expertise we have built.

301
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,418
And we have shared all of that.

302
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
We have workshops on blockchain wallets,

303
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,479
we have blogs, we have prescriptive

304
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,519
guidance, architecture guidance on how to build

305
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,658
wallets on AWS.

306
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:44,279
Another big program that we run

307
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,788
for Web 3 is the AWS public blockchain

308
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:49,000
data. We provide

309
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,000
blockchain data sets for free.

310
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,798
We choose the top blockchain protocols that

311
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,080
customers must ask for or care about. We

312
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,279
monitor the activity to see which protocols

313
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,349
we need to keep adding,

314
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,058
and we add datasets for free.

315
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,719
We've been able to do this through partners

316
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:06,739
over the years.

317
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:09,479
And as we move into 2026,

318
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
we're taking a minor shift in the approach and

319
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,918
we're gonna work directly with the foundations

320
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,229
to bring you data sets from the foundations

321
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,859
so you don't have to rely on any partner partner

322
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,940
products we'll provide it for free for

323
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,700
you and it'll be available through the AWS

324
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,099
public blockchain data set program.

325
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,619
Let's take a quick, quick look at these,

326
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,908
at these node runners. I have the QR code here for

327
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,090
those of you who care to

328
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,548
care to look at these blueprints. We have added support for

329
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,908
about 14 to 15 protocols. We'll

330
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:41,210
continue to add more.

331
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,558
As we go through next year, we're also going to be monitoring

332
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,178
how many more L2s are coming up.

333
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,158
And depending on where we see activity

334
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,399
and demand, we'll continue to add it here. It is an open

335
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,219
source project, so you're also welcome to contribute.

336
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:58,048
We now have support for all of these chains

337
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,129
that you're seeing on screen with our public blockchain

338
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,590
data. Uh, some of it

339
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,200
is available more natively and some through partners.

340
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,889
I do encourage you to look at the partner solutions too,

341
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,168
because if you're not building your own data analytics

342
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,298
solutions, the partners are providing the data

343
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:12,879
sets for free,

344
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,000
but they have fantastic products

345
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,200
that help you

346
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:18,658
take advantage of this data and

347
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,700
immediately start mining the data with their products.

348
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,859
So if you're not familiar with, which I think some of

349
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:23,798
you are not in the audience,

350
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,279
with how to handle on chain data, how to,

351
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,678
how to work with it.

352
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,288
They've already solved the problem for you, so I

353
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,330
highly encourage you to take a look at some of the partner

354
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,950
solutions.

355
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,288
The most recent data set we added is from Chronos,

356
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,820
um. We do see more

357
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,940
demand for more chains coming up,

358
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,639
so you should expect us to add more datasets

359
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,500
within the next year.

360
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,700
And that's the QR code for that as well.

361
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:51,058
Which brings me to partner solutions.

362
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,710
So regardless of what you're looking for,

363
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,058
whether it's blockchain infrastructure solutions,

364
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,788
wallet or custody solutions, data and analytic

365
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,908
solutions, these are all foundational pieces. There's a lot

366
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,029
more. I could open a blueprint and we could walk through

367
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,029
that. There's a lot more, but these are very

368
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,250
foundational and for each of these

369
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,489
we have vetted

370
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,090
and qualified several partners

371
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,369
who have solutions on AWS

372
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,048
which can help you stand up your,

373
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:18,070
your decentralized application very

374
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,798
quickly. Because

375
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,428
it takes care of all of the foundational base layers

376
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,469
for you, all you have to do is just focus

377
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:26,330
on that application you're looking to build for decentralized,

378
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:28,590
um, for decentralized technologies.

379
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:33,500
So let's take a quick look at top use

380
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,558
cases on web 3.

381
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,719
You know, I have a few here. They're not limited to

382
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,879
this. I just put it here because these are

383
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,009
where we see the most activity right now

384
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,019
tokenization,

385
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,619
trading, payments and wallets.

386
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,440
You're going to actually hear about tokenization payments

387
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,408
today in conjunction,

388
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,759
so I'm not, I'm not going to spend a lot of time

389
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,879
here, but what I want to leave you with

390
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,570
as a thought about Web 3

391
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,859
is one of the biggest trends that we're starting

392
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,048
to see emerge

393
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,869
is around digital assets,

394
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,769
tokenizing securities,

395
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:04,440
tokenizing currencies even.

396
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,119
Stable coins.

397
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,548
But all of this does not matter

398
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:11,869
if you don't have a use case downstream to actually

399
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,308
take take advantage of what is being provided

400
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,288
and that's where payment really comes in,

401
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,729
right? So think about one

402
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:21,070
as the enabler, the other as the actual

403
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,070
utility that's gonna that's

404
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,149
going to take this more mainstream as we move forward.

405
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,899
Here's an up close look at what a

406
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:29,639
tokenization

407
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,359
solution looks like.

408
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,070
And, and don't panic. I'm not gonna walk through the

409
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,269
solution. What I want to draw your attention

410
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,349
here is if you look at an end to end

411
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,529
tokenization solution

412
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,950
and you break down the building blocks of it,

413
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:43,609
you can quickly see

414
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,190
we have all the products and capabilities

415
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,629
to address each of those building blocks and AWS.

416
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,769
And I could just as easily map this

417
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,288
building block and show you how our partners

418
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,288
play over here who provides

419
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,369
the tokenization engine, who can provide a wallet,

420
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,269
who can provide the custody solutions

421
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,190
so the high level

422
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,928
idea I want you to take away from this

423
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,428
is not only

424
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,769
can we help you stand this up on your

425
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,849
own if you want to,

426
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,330
we could just as easily help you get moving

427
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,460
with partners as well.

428
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,119
So think about it as a blueprint that can map to AWS

429
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,369
or map to partners depending on your appetite

430
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:19,168
to build or buy.

431
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:23,359
Now let's take a look at the web 3 trends

432
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,149
that are shaping.

433
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,210
The ecosystem for us.

434
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,908
I have a few different bullets here, but I really

435
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,908
want to draw your attention to 2. That's what

436
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,250
we're going to focus on today.

437
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,729
There's been a lot of institutional government adoption

438
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,960
that we've started to see which has led to regulatory

439
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,590
clarity.

440
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,928
So if you're familiar with Genius Act, if you're familiar

441
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,229
with clarity itself,

442
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,129
you will know that stablecoins are starting

443
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,369
to get accepted more as

444
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,489
a digital asset that could be leveraged for

445
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,808
multiple different use cases, and we're seeing

446
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,928
more informed language from the governments on

447
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,330
this one. So we are hearing a

448
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,538
lot from our customers.

449
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:00,399
But like I said,

450
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,840
issuing a stable coin is one thing, but actually using

451
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,920
it is is what matters. That's what really

452
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,959
brings it to everybody and that's where payments

453
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,578
come in so stable coins and payments.

454
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,750
We're seeing it as one trend

455
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,750
together and you're gonna hear from

456
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,930
Eric and Josh today about

457
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,309
what we do with digital assets, how can you

458
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,848
actually build a payment solution,

459
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,809
which brings the next question

460
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,269
why does it matter? I already have currency.

461
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,318
I already have a payment solution. Why does this

462
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:29,529
all matter? It matters because

463
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,828
there are challenges with the existing traditional

464
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:32,868
payment solutions,

465
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,848
current payment solutions.

466
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,890
There's very high processing fees. There

467
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,469
are long settlement delays.

468
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,979
There's currency fluctuations to contend with.

469
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,029
Complex cross-border transactions

470
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,650
that need to happen if you're trying to move money from

471
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,608
one country to another.

472
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:52,769
And lastly, there's a lot of multiple intermediaries.

473
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Take a step back and let's look at it from the other side,

474
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,000
right? If the processing fees are

475
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,939
really high,

476
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,818
it's really hard to do smaller transactions.

477
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,439
Digital assets payments actually reduces

478
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,759
the cost because there's less infrastructure

479
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,539
needed, less

480
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,578
fraud management costs,

481
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,420
automated compliance,

482
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,670
all of this actually reduces the cost,

483
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,338
which brings a big benefit

484
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,479
which is micro payments.

485
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,880
You could now be paying smaller payments.

486
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,108
You could be doing a lot more transactions,

487
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,279
right? Again, settlement delays

488
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:27,630
if you're trying to trade, say on Monday, you've

489
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,689
got to make sure you're transferring on Thursday,

490
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:30,838
the previous week,

491
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,209
to make sure the money is ready for you to use.

492
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
Now if you're a small business

493
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,900
and you're contending with 3 or 4 delays in transactions,

494
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,439
it really affects your cash flow.

495
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,598
Digital assets settle in minutes.

496
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:45,709
Improving cash flow, improving response time.

497
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,549
Same goes for currency fluctuations. I don't think I

498
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,838
need to elaborate on that. If you're dealing with currency

499
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,959
fluctuations and waiting for money to settle,

500
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,680
you could be losing 1 or 2% points if currency

501
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,199
is shifting.

502
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,630
And intermediaries, right,

503
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,568
if we remove the intermediaries, if we reduce the intermediaries,

504
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,729
not only does it get faster, it gets cheaper,

505
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,529
but more importantly, it reduces the counterparty

506
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:12,000
risk. So

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,039
there are a lot of advantages that are starting

508
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,279
to drive why digital assets

509
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,670
payments are going to become more mainstream.

510
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,400
The one thought I'll leave you with is this allows

511
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,578
us to bank the unbanked.

512
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,489
There are over 1.2 billion

513
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,750
people without access to actual banking systems

514
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,509
today in the world.

515
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,209
This brings banking to them.

516
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,529
This brings peer to peer transactions.

517
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,088
This brings a lot more that they can do.

518
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,279
I'm going to now invite Eric to come and talk to you

519
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,598
about X402 payment protocol and

520
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,539
how it enables digital assets payments.

521
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thank you for listening to me.

522
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,838
Thanks, Ivan. Um

523
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,809
Super excited to be here. This is the this is the first

524
00:19:57,809 --> 00:19:59,380
time I've been at a silent disco

525
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,088
talk so if you're if you're in the audience and you can't

526
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,549
quite hear me, try the headphones,

527
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,818
um. So

528
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,910
I'm Eric. I lead engineering for Coinbase

529
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,650
developer platform.

530
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,088
CDP is kind of like

531
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,009
what AWS is to Amazon.

532
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,689
CDP is to Coinbase, so.

533
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,489
Amazon took all their expertise in

534
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,150
building

535
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,750
uh cloud infrastructure and

536
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,250
made that available to millions of businesses

537
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,489
to to leverage and use. Uh, CDP

538
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,000
has done the same with Coinbase's

539
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,328
infrastructure around custody of assets,

540
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,689
payments infrastructure, blockchain infrastructure,

541
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,049
wallets, orchestration, trading,

542
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:37,750
etc. There's a bunch of things

543
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,608
on the slide that we do that.

544
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:42,420
Are not even here. Like if you wanna talk

545
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,500
payments or stable coins or trading as a

546
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,660
service, uh, come and talk to me after

547
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,739
this. But we also have great wallets. We also have

548
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,598
great access to data products. We,

549
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:53,098
uh, also have nodes and staking and

550
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,098
on ramping and off-ramping and ramping into

551
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:56,219
the crypto ecosystem.

552
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,170
Um, but I'm not here to talk about CDP

553
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,328
today. I'm here to talk about agentic

554
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,650
payments and.

555
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,108
A project that we've been working on called X402.

556
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:10,088
Um, so broadly at Coinbase

557
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:12,209
we think that stablecoins are an

558
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,348
extremely compelling.

559
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:16,618
Technological solution for

560
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:17,279
AI

561
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,209
and so by a show of hands who in in the

562
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,479
audiences knows what a stablecoin is.

563
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,039
I guess, probably about 70% of people.

564
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,309
Um, maybe to level set, a stablecoin

565
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,039
is

566
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,140
a token

567
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,759
that exists on a blockchain

568
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,920
that's pegged 1 to 1 to some fiat asset.

569
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:38,259
So the one folks, uh,

570
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,799
most likely would have heard of in this room is USDC.

571
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,769
USDC was a,

572
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,539
uh, stablecoin launched by Circle and Coinbase

573
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,358
in partnership.

574
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,779
Uh, it's backed 1 to 1 by a mix

575
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,779
of US Treasuries and dollars

576
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,930
and bank accounts, and it's fully audited.

577
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,880
Both Circle and Coinbase are now public companies.

578
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,309
You can literally go see every Treasury

579
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:00,420
serial number that backs USDC and

580
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,568
know for a fact that it's backed 1 to 1.

581
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,299
So if you're holding one USDC,

582
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,759
you can get out $1 into

583
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,439
your bank account.

584
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:10,439
Um, Why

585
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,519
are stablecoins really good for agents? Well, there's,

586
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
there's a bunch of factors that I'll get into cost to transact,

587
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:16,459
speed of settlements,

588
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,318
um, but

589
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,160
there's kind of a more fundamental problem that you face

590
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,239
when you get into payments and that there are no

591
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,779
open standards for payments.

592
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,750
So let me hit you with a definition,

593
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:32,130
so. The Internet has existed

594
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,299
for coming up on 35

595
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,430
years roughly,

596
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,969
uh, and we don't have a standard for

597
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:38,630
payments.

598
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,180
If you want me to go really, really deep into

599
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,868
this point,

600
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,670
I did a talk on Wednesday on the FSI track

601
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,009
just basically breaking down standards

602
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:48,390
and the

603
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:51,088
reasoning why they're important, so I encourage

604
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,529
folks to go check out that recording.

605
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,009
Um,

606
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:56,529
but let me define what I, how

607
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,789
I think about Internet native payments, and so

608
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:01,410
I would define Internet native payments as a method for

609
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,809
computers to programmatically exchange

610
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:04,328
payment

611
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,368
in a standard and neutral way.

612
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,729
Within the existing client-server paradigm

613
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:10,868
that the internet is built on.

614
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:13,670
And without requiring a

615
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,608
human to be in the loop.

616
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,098
So what do I mean by standard and neutral?

617
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,640
It means that every interaction

618
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,719
between a client and a server should be the

619
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,838
same. We don't download a different

620
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:25,729
browser for every website that we visit.

621
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,500
The Internet works because

622
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,140
the browser that you use that's published by Google

623
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,279
can visit a website published by Amazon, and

624
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,390
there's an agreed upon standard way to

625
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,459
transmit that data,

626
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,578
those standards being

627
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,039
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

628
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,959
for interaction,

629
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:40,959
etc.

630
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,259
Neutral in that

631
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:45,618
it doesn't bias towards any particular

632
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,739
payment processor or blockchain

633
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,459
or mechanism of payment.

634
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:53,199
Any mechanism that wants to be represented within

635
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,519
an Internet native standard needs to be

636
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,838
able to represent their payment flows within that

637
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:58,400
standard

638
00:23:58,838 --> 00:23:59,759
without gatekeeping.

639
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:02,858
And then within the existing client server

640
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,439
paradigm

641
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,140
for those of you who have integrated a payment API before, you'll

642
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,358
probably have noticed that at some point the client

643
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:10,660
usually will make a call out to someone else or

644
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,199
there's a web hook or there's

645
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:13,680
some component that

646
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:14,920
exists

647
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,358
outside of the

648
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:18,979
request the client is making to a server directly.

649
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,759
And then without requiring a human in the loop.

650
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,779
Almost all payments that have occurred on the internet up until

651
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:25,640
this point have been

652
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,098
downstream of a human entering a credit card on

653
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:28,660
a website.

654
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,338
And so if we believe that we're going

655
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,640
into an age of agents,

656
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:34,430
we need to break out of that paradigm.

657
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,170
And you see remnants of this idea that we

658
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,630
need an Internet native

659
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:41,390
mechanism for payments

660
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,088
all the way back into the 80s and 90s and

661
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:46,390
so. The HDP

662
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,890
1.1 standard,

663
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,868
uh, which I believe was published in 1997, reserved

664
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:53,588
an HDP status code, status code 402.

665
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,500
Uh, for

666
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,799
future use to represent payment

667
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,420
is required to access this resource.

668
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:02,729
In fact,

669
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:05,430
the Mark Andreessen, you know, co-creator of

670
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,199
Netscape,

671
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:08,868
spent a lot of time trying to make payments on the Internet

672
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,469
work, uh,

673
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:13,029
and, but the technology wasn't quite there,

674
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:15,469
and part of the reason we think the technology is there

675
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:17,269
now is the rise of stablecoins.

676
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:20,439
And so 5 years ago, back in 2020,

677
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,979
it cost about $10 to send a stablecoin.

678
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:26,108
But While

679
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,250
kind of the world was focused on AI and

680
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:29,009
many other things,

681
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,779
blockchains got extremely good.

682
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,650
And now it typically costs under

683
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,019
0.1 of a cent to send a stablecoin,

684
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:37,670
and that could be a single

685
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,209
dollar or that could be a million

686
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:42,410
dollars. But the actual cost

687
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,209
on chain

688
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:44,549
to send that money

689
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,608
is 0.10 cent.

690
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,759
And there's no percent base fee. You're purely

691
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,759
using, paying for the resources on

692
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,160
the blockchain that your transaction is utilizing.

693
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:55,650
It kind of breaks.

694
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,779
It's, it's unintuitive. Most people are used to, oh,

695
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,209
there'll be like a 30 cents fee and a

696
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:01,390
3% fee,

697
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,430
um, but with blockchains you're paying for

698
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,068
the processing power of the blockchain that you're actually utilizing.

699
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,689
And so as blockchains scale and

700
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:11,680
can do more throughput, can settle faster,

701
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,130
you can pass on those direct benefits

702
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,410
to payments.

703
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,209
So AI really forces us to reevaluate

704
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:21,430
Internet native payments.

705
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,309
AI is being used by hundreds of millions of people

706
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,368
every day now,

707
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,828
but the number of economic transactions

708
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,868
that they are performing are incredibly low.

709
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:33,009
And part of the reason for that is AI agents

710
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:33,880
are fundamentally

711
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,479
a program running on a computer. I'm not sure

712
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,519
how many of you have

713
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:40,009
written an AI agent, maybe a show of hands if you've

714
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:41,098
written an AI agent.

715
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,009
About maybe about a third of people,

716
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,489
uh, you will quickly realize when you

717
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:48,568
want to start building in an AI that AI is

718
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:50,689
not so different from a wild loop that just

719
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,809
runs for a long time that makes calls

720
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:53,420
to an LLM.

721
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:58,549
These agents have no fundamental,

722
00:26:59,009 --> 00:26:59,549
no

723
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:00,828
way

724
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,680
to consistently transact.

725
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,949
You end up with these kind of walled gardens

726
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,108
if these gardens exist at all.

727
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,250
Uh, how many of you by show of hands has had an AI agent

728
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,130
pay for something for you on the Internet?

729
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,709
Probably with ACP or some other standard,

730
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:18,019
yeah, yeah,

731
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:20,400
so you're starting to see these standards emerge

732
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:23,098
to address this problem, and ACP is a great standard

733
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:25,400
for checkout and kind of human in the loop

734
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,459
conversational commerce, but I think if we want true

735
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,400
autonomy we need

736
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:30,858
the standards of payments to be built directly into the

737
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,640
internet. Because

738
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,838
AI agents really break the fundamental

739
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,598
economic model of the internet.

740
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:41,868
And so if you think about how a lot of

741
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,750
the internet works.

742
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,318
And has worked up until this point.

743
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:48,529
Some merchant is paying some

744
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,818
website. That website shows you

745
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:52,459
content and ads for the merchant.

746
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,430
You as a user consume that content and

747
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,150
that ad,

748
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,150
uh, and then at some point you convert

749
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,689
and you purchase a good from the merchant.

750
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,868
This is, you know, I'd say a lot of how the consumer

751
00:28:03,868 --> 00:28:05,160
Internet works, and

752
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,559
the website is incentivized to publish

753
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,039
content because they can serve ads. Those ads convert.

754
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,439
The merchant pays. It's a nice closed loop between

755
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,180
three actors.

756
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:16,809
What we've seen is that AI removes

757
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,769
the ads and hence removes the payments

758
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:22,709
as more people start to use their chat interfaces

759
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:23,689
to consume the internet.

760
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,489
You probably haven't seen an ad from a

761
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:28,489
website that has informed a response from an

762
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,189
LLM

763
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,189
and scraping to train these LLMs also

764
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:35,108
results in value being missed by the content publishers

765
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,430
and so you break the circle

766
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,049
so we need a new circle we need a new economic model for

767
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:40,170
these kinds of interactions.

768
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,680
And one of the ways to do this is just

769
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,299
directly pay for the content.

770
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,799
Skip this loop,

771
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:48,358
directly pay the website.

772
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,640
And this is where we enter X402, which is

773
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,680
the open standard for internet native payments

774
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,239
that Coinbase has been working on.

775
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,630
And really what X402 is is a bridge

776
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,469
between the Internet

777
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:02,979
and the blockchain-based

778
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:03,568
payments.

779
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,318
It's very distracting to speak when people are clapping, um.

780
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,598
Bridge between the internet and blockchain based payments

781
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:13,500
and so you get the benefits of

782
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:15,739
blockchains and the benefits of.

783
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,828
These subcent transactions.

784
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:20,719
In the Internet,

785
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,380
part of the reason why it's not viable to pay

786
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,719
directly for content is because it's really hard to move

787
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,959
30 cents or 50 cents or $1.

788
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:30,199
With existing rails that

789
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:33,430
When fees are 30% to 3%.

790
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,269
As a business, if you're charging 50 cents, you're

791
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,529
now getting 14 cents in value,

792
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,868
which is a lot of margin to eat,

793
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,380
whereas if you're being charged 0.1 cents.

794
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,140
Well, now you're making 4050 cents or 49.9

795
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
cents, right?

796
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,078
And so what is X402?

797
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:54,068
X402 is an open standard for internet native

798
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:56,229
payments. It hits the points of the philosophy

799
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,269
I hit, I mentioned earlier in the

800
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,309
talk. It started at Coinbase. It was,

801
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,430
it was actually created by me.

802
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:04,318
Uh, and it's now being moved into an

803
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:06,328
independent foundation

804
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,328
structured as a Linux Foundation JDF.

805
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,719
So how does, how's it going?

806
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,699
So in November X402 performed 70

807
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:15,838
million transactions.

808
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,680
Uh The growth is pretty

809
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:22,039
startling, to be honest with you. We had this nice 30%

810
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,618
week over week growth chart and then

811
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,019
hit a huge inflection point in November where

812
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:27,559
it, it really took off.

813
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,979
And of those 70 million transactions,

814
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,939
the volume, the number of dollars

815
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,199
moved was actually

816
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,059
about $40 million.

817
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,539
And so you'll notice that that $40 million is less

818
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,799
than $70 million. The average transaction size

819
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,420
on X402 represented a

820
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,140
transaction of roughly 80 cents.

821
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,269
Uh, and those are transactions you couldn't really

822
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:49,630
do in card rails, and

823
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:52,289
you know X402 would let you scale up payments

824
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,769
anywhere from 1 cent to

825
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:55,608
a million dollars if you really cared to.

826
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:56,910
Um,

827
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,750
But that niche of kind of micropayments

828
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,368
has really been

829
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,250
the product market fit for X402

830
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,430
thus far and unlocked new things that

831
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,568
previously weren't possible.

832
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,689
So how does X402 actually work?

833
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,269
So

834
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:12,769
standard to the

835
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,309
existing flow of a client and a server, so a

836
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,489
client, a browser, your mobile phone,

837
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:19,469
an LLM, a bot

838
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:22,049
makes a HTP request

839
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,568
to a a server.

840
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:26,838
That server will then respond with a 402 status

841
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:29,199
code along with a header called payment

842
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:29,818
required

843
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:32,039
which contains a uh.

844
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,140
Contains data that conveys how to make the payment.

845
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,338
I'll get into what that data looks like in a second.

846
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,799
The client then says looks at that

847
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,959
header and then constructs a

848
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,078
a payload that represents that payment.

849
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:46,759
How that payment

850
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:49,108
payload gets constructed I'll touch on in a

851
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,479
minute. Don't worry, I'll get to it

852
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:52,598
and then remakes that same request

853
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:55,338
just with the header included in that request of

854
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,368
payment signature and then the payload

855
00:31:57,368 --> 00:31:58,259
that they constructed.

856
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,029
The server

857
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:03,170
Now has an option.

858
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:04,910
It can do all the work that it's

859
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,189
doing on this slide

860
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,650
itself or for teams

861
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,848
that are less familiar with working in web 3,

862
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,108
you can delegate

863
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,689
the blockchain interactions in X402 to

864
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,068
what we call a facilitator.

865
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,009
And so facilitator has a fairly standardized

866
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:19,588
flow of.

867
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:22,670
The server will call to the facilitator

868
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,709
via HTP.

869
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,640
To an endpoint we call verify

870
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,259
and it'll propagate to it

871
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,618
both the payment requirements that sent the client

872
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,838
and the payment signature the client sent it, and

873
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:34,380
it'll ask the facilitator the question,

874
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,479
is this payment going to be valid? Should I actually

875
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,160
process this payment?

876
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:42,150
In the happy path, the facilitator will say 200

877
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,618
responses, yes, this is a good

878
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,358
payload. This will result in you

879
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:48,219
being paid. You should go and do the work

880
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,239
that's needed to respond to the client.

881
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:52,059
So this is where the server would do

882
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,318
its database queries, it's cache lookups,

883
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:56,059
generate a PDF, whatever it's doing

884
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,199
as a web server.

885
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:00,328
Uh, and then after it's done the work, it will

886
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,848
post to settle on a facilitator,

887
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,789
uh, again with that payment signature and that payment

888
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:06,348
required

889
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,009
data that it gave the client

890
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:09,930
and the facilitator will

891
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:12,650
handle submitting the transaction to a blockchain.

892
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:15,848
Once the blockchain blockchain transaction is

893
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:16,559
submitted,

894
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:18,989
the facilitator will respond back

895
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:21,309
to the server and say

896
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,890
this payment succeeded.

897
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,279
And this is actually a blocking operation.

898
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,568
With modern L2s and modern blockchains,

899
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:31,219
the processing time to confirm a transaction

900
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,920
is roughly 2 seconds,

901
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:35,449
and so you can actually know before you

902
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,199
return to the client,

903
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:39,140
I've received the money and it's not a reversible

904
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,779
transaction.

905
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:41,660
Stablecoin support

906
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,759
Refunds but not chargebacks

907
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:47,019
and so you as the as the server can always

908
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:49,140
say oh yeah I made a mistake I'm going

909
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,539
to refund to the client

910
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,019
but the client doesn't have the ability to take funds they've

911
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,479
already given to you away.

912
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,930
And so now that you have your funds, you can

913
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,118
return to the client and say, hey, here's here's that news

914
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:02,160
article, here's that API access that

915
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,250
you want. Uh, and you

916
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,289
do that through a standard HTP

917
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,889
through standard HTP verbs, and you can, it

918
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,208
works through the entire entirety of the HDP

919
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,349
spec just leveraging headers. You can return

920
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:14,280
to a post to

921
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,769
get it, put, whatever you want.

922
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,860
So let's get into that payment requirements, uh,

923
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,590
data structure. So this is the top

924
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,619
level of what payment requirements looks like.

925
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,478
You have a top level version for the X402

926
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:28,059
protocol.

927
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:31,039
Uh, we're about to release the V2 of the spec.

928
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,148
And then a list of.

929
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:36,568
Payment requirements that we call accepts,

930
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,898
so this accepts keyword allows the server

931
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:40,938
to specify multiple ways

932
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:42,958
of payment. So you as a server can

933
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,199
say I wanna, I support being

934
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,239
paid with USCC on base. I also support

935
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,320
being paid with USCT on

936
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,840
Solana.

937
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,619
And in the future we export 2 is

938
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,820
going to support fiat methods. You may even say

939
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,889
I support USD on Mastercard

940
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,500
or Visa.

941
00:34:58,418 --> 00:34:59,329
Uh, and then an error

942
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,389
to convey error information to the client.

943
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:05,469
And so each one of those payment requirements

944
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,329
that in that accepts key is is

945
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,389
kind of exploded out here

946
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,929
and they consist of a scheme, a network,

947
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,668
an asset,

948
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,708
a pay to field,

949
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:16,648
and then max amount required,

950
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,409
which is the amount to be to be transferred. There's

951
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,449
other fields of metadata there, but those are

952
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:22,590
kind of the most important ones.

953
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,208
And so what this can look like is

954
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:27,469
you may return to the client something that looks like

955
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:28,469
what I have on the right

956
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,030
where we're operating on X402 version

957
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,610
one. We accept,

958
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:35,530
uh, the scheme exact

959
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,530
on base

960
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,418
of the asset that is the identifier

961
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:41,010
for USDC

962
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,909
and then I wanna be paid to

963
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,300
a crypto address and that crypto

964
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,510
address can be any wallet.

965
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:47,648
It could be

966
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,128
an exchange like Coinbase. It can be any.

967
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,079
Any address that is capable

968
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:53,969
of receiving.

969
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,039
Uh, crypto assets.

970
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,958
And then the, you didn't pay me, payment not

971
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,519
included. And

972
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,079
these

973
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,800
And so let's talk about the payment payload.

974
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,699
You'll notice scheme and network,

975
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,639
and the way to think about it is scheme is the logical

976
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,139
way that money moves.

977
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,059
And so in exact

978
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:15,239
it's the equivalent of me handing you a dollar.

979
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:18,110
That's as complex as the interaction is.

980
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,429
You've, I've taken $1 out of my wallet

981
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,469
and I've handed it to you.

982
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,369
You could have other logical ways of moving money, for

983
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:26,329
example, with LLM token generation,

984
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,909
you don't necessarily know how much to charge.

985
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,750
Until the generation of the the tokens

986
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,530
is complete

987
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:35,228
because LLMs don't deterministically

988
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:37,398
finish. And so you may, uh,

989
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,688
you can imagine a scheme that we'd call up to

990
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,688
which says, hey, I may charge you up to

991
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:42,510
$1

992
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:45,039
but I don't yet know exactly what you're going to be

993
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,510
billed and so

994
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:48,550
pre-authorize me $1 and then

995
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:51,128
after tokens are finished generating I'll

996
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,239
charge you based on the work that I actually

997
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,000
performed. And so

998
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,199
how you construct this payload

999
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,219
is what we call a mechanism,

1000
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,619
and the mechanism is based on the top

1001
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,378
of scheme and network. And what this that

1002
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:05,119
means is that

1003
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,179
the way you perform the payment

1004
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,860
is decoupled from the network and the logical

1005
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,199
way that payment is performed.

1006
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,159
And so

1007
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:14,739
exact on base Seulia

1008
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,929
works differently than Exact does on Solana, for,

1009
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:18,739
for example.

1010
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:22,030
And you can optimize the payment flow

1011
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,289
for the blockchain network or fiat network

1012
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,349
where the funds are actually going to settle.

1013
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:30,228
And so some of our goals for X402 were

1014
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:32,570
safety, nativeness, ease of adoption,

1015
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:34,949
and neutrality and extensibility.

1016
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,389
And so on safety,

1017
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:39,228
the client holds

1018
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:41,570
the logic to construct the payment.

1019
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:44,478
The server or the facilitator have no ability

1020
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:46,559
to move funds without the client

1021
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,500
authorizing the funds to move.

1022
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:51,349
The server elects which payment mechanisms

1023
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,530
it chooses to accept

1024
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,949
and so someone can't say, hey, I

1025
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:56,289
paid you on this obscure chain

1026
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,090
now you owe me now you owe me your services.

1027
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:02,228
The server dictates where which

1028
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:04,309
mechanisms they choose to to accept, and

1029
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:06,429
then the client chooses which one it wants

1030
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,668
to use. Similarly to if you're at a point of sale,

1031
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,469
it might accept Visa, Visa, Mastercard, Amex,

1032
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:12,309
and cash.

1033
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:14,829
You pull out your wallet, you say, Oh, I've got a Visa card. I'm

1034
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:15,550
gonna pay with Visa.

1035
00:38:16,648 --> 00:38:18,398
And then the facilitator is not

1036
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,978
in custody of funds at any point

1037
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,378
and cannot direct funds and route

1038
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:24,519
them in any way.

1039
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,519
It is simply an abstraction over

1040
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,260
the blockchain to make it so that servers don't

1041
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,539
need to run hot wallets and run RPC nodes.

1042
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:34,559
They can delegate that responsibility to a facilitator

1043
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,219
that just manages gas and transacting with blockchains

1044
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:37,739
at scale.

1045
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,659
And so

1046
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,489
safety for EVM Exact

1047
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,228
specifically we use EIP 309

1048
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:47,239
messages, which is a standard

1049
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:49,550
in the EVM ecosystem for signature-based

1050
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,168
transfer,

1051
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,789
and the result is that the only way funds

1052
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,800
can move is if the client has signed

1053
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,699
an intent that the funds can move.

1054
00:38:58,398 --> 00:38:59,610
Nativeness. So

1055
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,030
we want to include payments in

1056
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:04,329
the existing communication that

1057
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:06,449
occurs between a client and server. And so that

1058
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:08,519
means that these types need to be represented in a way

1059
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,349
that are native to the transport.

1060
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,148
We also decouple transport from

1061
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:16,010
how funds move in X402. And

1062
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,010
so in HTP we include payment

1063
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,590
requirements and payloads and headers.

1064
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:21,989
In the existing requests that occur

1065
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:24,530
in MCP, we include them in the

1066
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,429
meta field

1067
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:28,320
that exists in every MCP

1068
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,590
interaction and tool call.

1069
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:31,889
Then in A to A we include it in

1070
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,938
the metadata X402

1071
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,309
payment field,

1072
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,809
uh, and we try to follow the conventions of each

1073
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,090
transport that occur and you, this

1074
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,349
is all standardized and documented in the repo.

1075
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,329
Any person can write a client or

1076
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,469
server independently of our reference

1077
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,728
SDK that will be able to interact with any other

1078
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,389
client and server because

1079
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,369
how transport works is as

1080
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:56,228
part of the standard so you can go

1081
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:58,628
read the documentation on how

1082
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,139
X402 works within the MCP context

1083
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:03,269
and then write your own client or use

1084
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:05,909
many clients that have been written over the last couple of months.

1085
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,918
Ease of adoption, so.

1086
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,320
Whenever possible, prevent the need for RPC

1087
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,878
or gas on the client.

1088
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,340
You shouldn't need to introduce

1089
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,719
new technologies to a client's stack. We want as

1090
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,898
much backwards compatibility with browsers

1091
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,269
and the existing web ecosystem as

1092
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:22,820
possible.

1093
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,019
And then ensure all signatures and

1094
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,208
standards and signers in our SDKs

1095
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,260
adhere to industry standard interfaces.

1096
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,559
This is a very like

1097
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,918
in the weeds thing,

1098
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:35,360
but if there's an existing pattern for

1099
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,820
representing an action,

1100
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:39,179
just use that. Don't invent new things.

1101
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:42,219
Then we try to provide middleware for

1102
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,260
all the common HTTP frameworks. So

1103
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,228
if you use Express, Hono, Flask,

1104
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:48,909
Jin, there's more here that I'm missing,

1105
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:51,309
but you can integrate X402

1106
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,389
into your existing service as a middleware

1107
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:54,309
in one line of code.

1108
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,429
And then I have

1109
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,510
facilitators, as I've mentioned that abstract away crypto

1110
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,829
and make it so that the barrier to adoption is incredibly

1111
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,949
low. You don't need to learn how to operate a hot wallet.

1112
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,309
You don't need a a node.

1113
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,309
Facilitator, you just need a URL to

1114
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,530
to make RPC requests to and

1115
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,449
everything happens and

1116
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:13,878
our middleware is extracted uh abstract that

1117
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:14,750
away. You just

1118
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:15,909
add the

1119
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,449
facilitator URL you wanna use into your

1120
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:19,610
middleware config.

1121
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,550
Then extensibility neutrality. This is why

1122
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,590
we decouple data structure from

1123
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,610
implementation

1124
00:41:26,878 --> 00:41:29,030
so that EVM Exact can be different

1125
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,250
than SVM Exact

1126
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:31,570
and client and

1127
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:33,989
clients and facilitators have a shared

1128
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,719
understanding of what to do in that scenario.

1129
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,489
Similarly to if an image tag is using.

1130
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:41,010
PNG. Your server knows

1131
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,010
how to encode that PNG and your browser knows how

1132
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,050
to render that PNG.

1133
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,628
And then we would prefer to be philosophically

1134
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:48,889
we prefer to be

1135
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:51,590
unopinionated and modular versus

1136
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,688
trying to be full stack and solve every problem,

1137
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:55,590
trying to solve one problem very well

1138
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,489
and things like identity

1139
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,050
and other aspects in the agentic system,

1140
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,628
we wanna be compatible with those things, not try

1141
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:04,789
to force everyone into our full stack

1142
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,829
solution. And so what

1143
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:07,550
does this give us?

1144
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:11,849
Well, so this demo video I have here is

1145
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:13,590
uh. Uh

1146
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,728
me using my chat, uh,

1147
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:18,780
my chat interface LLM

1148
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,849
to research X402 and the trends about X402

1149
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:23,139
that have been happening recently.

1150
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,039
Uh, and what, what's unique about this chat interface

1151
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,179
is it has

1152
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,800
an MCP tool that gives it access to

1153
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,300
a wallet with stablecoins.

1154
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:34,070
Uh, the ability to pay for X402

1155
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,800
resources

1156
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,219
and the ability to discover

1157
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:38,559
X402 resources

1158
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:40,239
and so what you'll see is that

1159
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:41,918
it first searches the web

1160
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,039
to try to research X402

1161
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
and then it checks what we call the bazaarre, which is the

1162
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,519
marketplace for X402 services,

1163
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:49,878
uh, and

1164
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,340
pays for data from one

1165
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,340
of those services to enrich the report that it

1166
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,719
writes about X402 and these funds.

1167
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:59,438
And this is the wallet that it has. These funds

1168
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:01,079
are isolated to the agent.

1169
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:03,599
It has 56 cents in its wallet. It only

1170
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,050
can spend that 56 cents.

1171
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,739
Then I have the ability to set permissions

1172
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,039
on how much you can spend per request or in a

1173
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:12,179
session. And anyone can build this

1174
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,208
experience. This is entirely built off of

1175
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,340
open standards like X402

1176
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,500
and the wallet ecosystem and

1177
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,918
infrastructure that exists

1178
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,378
around stablecoins.

1179
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,019
Uh, this, this

1180
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,378
experience works on anything that accepts X402.

1181
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,809
And so if your API accepts X402

1182
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,929
payment. This MCP can

1183
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:32,648
now pay you for your content.

1184
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:34,019
Um

1185
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:37,340
And that's pretty powerful I think it unlocks a

1186
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,228
level of agentic

1187
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:39,179
use

1188
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:41,659
that hasn't previously been possible. Right now

1189
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:43,820
you need to integrate each MCP tool manually.

1190
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:46,699
Now you integrate one MCP tool and it

1191
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:48,898
can pay for anything in an ecosystem

1192
00:43:48,898 --> 00:43:50,878
and what you get is dynamic agents

1193
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,219
where the set of capabilities that they have

1194
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,599
aren't limited

1195
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:57,039
to a set of vertical integrations

1196
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,199
and walled gardens that you as a human have

1197
00:43:59,378 --> 00:44:00,789
taken and integrated one by one

1198
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,699
just like your browser can visit any.

1199
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:05,699
Website on the internet, your agent can now pay

1200
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:07,860
for any tool or service to make it better doing

1201
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,418
work for you.

1202
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:12,639
So now I'm gonna pass it off to Josh.

1203
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:15,329
Uh, Josh is gonna show you some solutions

1204
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:17,340
on how to use X402 and stablecoins

1205
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,840
to build, uh, payment

1206
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,619
infrastructure on AWS.

1207
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,309
Right down. All

1208
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:30,429
right, thank, thank you, Eric.

1209
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,168
So let's start at a high level

1210
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:37,208
conceptually, right? Um, we like

1211
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,409
to think of a stack for building scalable

1212
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,429
AI payment systems here at AWS.

1213
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:43,809
A stack starts with a platform

1214
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:44,610
or a foundation.

1215
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:47,079
And AWS, as Arvin was talking about earlier,

1216
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,090
provides primitives like EC2 for compute

1217
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,820
or Amazon Bedrock for AI

1218
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,179
or security primitives like Nitro Enclaves

1219
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,340
or Edge services like Cloudfront. And today we're going to talk

1220
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,619
through some of these foundations powering

1221
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:00,438
the stack

1222
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:02,699
and how to actually build solutions.

1223
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:05,449
So on top of this, we leverage open protocols,

1224
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,510
like Eric talked about, right? So some of these have been

1225
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,989
around for ages, HTTP, DNS, HTML,

1226
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:11,780
languages, frameworks, protocols,

1227
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,269
and now X402 is an open standard

1228
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:16,389
for payment that we can integrate into this and start

1229
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,389
to use it. From here

1230
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:21,239
we can start to combine platforms, protocols,

1231
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,409
and build and enhance more advanced

1232
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:24,010
services,

1233
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,429
right? So this is middleware, some of these are

1234
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:28,909
services as products, B2B products,

1235
00:45:29,128 --> 00:45:31,329
and so Amazon provides services

1236
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,148
like Bedrock.

1237
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:34,530
Um, we provide Agent Core for Bedrock, which I'm gonna talk

1238
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,530
about in a moment, and we have this whole suite

1239
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,530
for gentic AI.

1240
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,228
Coinbase provides

1241
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:41,769
what they call Agent kit, and Agent kit is

1242
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:43,769
a tool to connect a wallet to

1243
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:46,030
an AI agent, and we're going to leverage that today as well.

1244
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,938
And lastly, all of this enables

1245
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,829
us to build complex solutions

1246
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,829
to connect to web 2 applications,

1247
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:56,398
web 3 applications, hybrid

1248
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:58,719
applications, and agent to agent communication

1249
00:45:58,719 --> 00:45:59,918
that involve payment.

1250
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:03,289
So if we start zoomed out, um, I'm not going to

1251
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:05,570
spend a ton of time on this slide, but AWS

1252
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,688
provides agentic AI solutions

1253
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:08,809
across the entire stack,

1254
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,250
right? So we have infrastructure at

1255
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,610
the bottom layer, we have development and services

1256
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,628
for builders, and we have applications.

1257
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:17,800
We provide this suite of models,

1258
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:20,148
tools, applications, and expertise

1259
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:22,168
that can help you get started on your journey in the way that

1260
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:23,090
you want to do that.

1261
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,610
We also provide robust infrastructure that

1262
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,648
includes custom silicon,

1263
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:29,570
data access, and other foundational services.

1264
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,989
And today I'm going to zoom in just

1265
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,188
this middle layer and bedrock because we're talking about

1266
00:46:34,188 --> 00:46:36,228
builders and we're talking about adopting these new

1267
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:36,789
protocols.

1268
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
So Amazon Bedrock, just to, as

1269
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,039
a prerequisite before we go into this, is a serverless

1270
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,500
and fully managed service

1271
00:46:43,878 --> 00:46:46,079
that helps you build, deploy and operate

1272
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,320
Gen AI applications,

1273
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,699
including agents.

1274
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:49,699
Bedrock

1275
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:52,579
provides access to leading foundation models from

1276
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,438
Mistral, Anthropic, Cohere,

1277
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:56,619
Amazon, and more,

1278
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,398
and you can apply guardrails, optimize for cost, optimize

1279
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:00,179
for latency,

1280
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:02,280
leverage your data very easily.

1281
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,110
We can use these features for any type of use case,

1282
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:07,918
right, including building and operating crypto native

1283
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:09,800
agentic AI payment systems.

1284
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,300
Betteric also includes Agent Corp.

1285
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:14,780
And so we have these services along the

1286
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,300
top.

1287
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:16,639
These are

1288
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,260
services to deploy and operate agents securely

1289
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,628
at scale, right? You can think of this top layer as

1290
00:47:21,628 --> 00:47:23,800
sort of operationalized and running those agents.

1291
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:26,378
So we have run time, which is a serverless

1292
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:28,039
runtime for long running

1293
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,409
agents where you don't have to manage the infrastructure for

1294
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,418
them. Then we have Agent Corp Gateway.

1295
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:35,668
Which allows you to easily integrate MCP

1296
00:47:35,668 --> 00:47:37,829
servers, APIs with your agents and provide an

1297
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,878
easy way to empower them with a

1298
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:41,260
large array of tools.

1299
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,250
And we're gonna use

1300
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,789
both of these services today.

1301
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,360
And then lastly,

1302
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:48,320
Agent Core browser and code interpreter

1303
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,860
um allow your agent to act autonomously in the browser

1304
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,719
and to execute a code on your own terms.

1305
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,579
On the bottom layer, I think of this as

1306
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,739
sort of supporting tools, right, that enable these

1307
00:47:58,739 --> 00:47:59,429
agents.

1308
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:02,039
Um, you need identity to build enterprise ready

1309
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,148
agents with standard-based authentication. You

1310
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,378
use things like OAth with your agents.

1311
00:48:07,168 --> 00:48:08,300
Agent core memory

1312
00:48:08,878 --> 00:48:10,878
allows your agent to store and retrieve short-term and

1313
00:48:10,878 --> 00:48:12,958
long-term memory for your agents because these agents

1314
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:14,530
are stateless, running in runtime.

1315
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,409
And we're also going to use this today, right?

1316
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,139
And then lastly, observability helps centralize

1317
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,639
your observability stack for Gen AI.

1318
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:23,320
Agents, um,

1319
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,918
especially payment systems,

1320
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:27,958
accuracy and the lack of determinism

1321
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:30,000
in LLMs makes observability

1322
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,599
has to have an extra layer in there.

1323
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,000
So when we use these tools,

1324
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,860
um, if we zoom out here, what can we accomplish

1325
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,898
here? Well, one of the key areas we see

1326
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:41,099
in the maturity of AI

1327
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:43,519
is the ability to discover and use

1328
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,619
tools, right? So an agent isn't,

1329
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:48,369
this could be tens of thousands of tools at the end of the

1330
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:50,478
day. So Agent Core Gateway plugs into

1331
00:48:50,478 --> 00:48:51,360
this ecosystem,

1332
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:53,809
allows for tool discovery, paired with

1333
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:56,148
Auth to say which tools can which agents use,

1334
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,679
and then we can start to leverage tools which

1335
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:00,800
can be paid API keys. Maybe you have an

1336
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,840
existing relationship, a monthly subscription where you

1337
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,590
have an API key.

1338
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:06,469
You maybe you have internal services running on a

1339
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:08,550
lambda function or AC2 server that you wanna

1340
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,590
call, but what we're gonna talk about

1341
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,590
today is this middle channel.

1342
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:15,050
Maybe you want the ability for your

1343
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,269
agents to discover and use tools

1344
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:18,769
in the way that Eric showed in his video

1345
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,139
to say,

1346
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:22,429
you know, go see what's available on

1347
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,878
the Internet, go see what I can use X42

1348
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,269
to accomplish my goals, right?

1349
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,780
So we can take an architecture where we have cloud

1350
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,958
front, we use lambda edge to allow that to run

1351
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:32,599
functions,

1352
00:49:32,938 --> 00:49:34,938
and we have content backed by S3 or

1353
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:35,639
EC2,

1354
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,300
and we can create this um framework.

1355
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:39,199
So today

1356
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,760
I'm gonna talk about.

1357
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:43,619
An example of a travel agent AI

1358
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:45,688
and the data providers that work with it.

1359
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:48,458
So, um, this could be built by a company,

1360
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,579
you know, we have a hypothetical company looking to serve

1361
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:51,360
customers

1362
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,978
that are building automated vacation packages,

1363
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:56,289
let's say, right? So the agent

1364
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:57,519
presents a front end

1365
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,519
to the user,

1366
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:01,300
uh, which is the travel agent AI interface, the

1367
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,369
chat, and the AI can then use Agent

1368
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,429
Core Gateway to go and discover available

1369
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:07,938
tools from an X402 MCP

1370
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,739
server. So

1371
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:12,228
as examples here,

1372
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:14,679
right, this agent is going to need a lot of different types of data.

1373
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:17,039
It might, it might need to leverage

1374
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:19,438
a global distribution system that has hotel inventory,

1375
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:22,039
flights, flight prices, availability, seat availability,

1376
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,119
and more. This may result, this may

1377
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,239
charge in a variety of ways. They could be per query,

1378
00:50:26,438 --> 00:50:28,599
booking fees or challenges.

1379
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,679
It also might need points of interest, databases,

1380
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,849
local attractions, um, these could be per

1381
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:35,938
query, right? Send me the review for this restaurant

1382
00:50:36,128 --> 00:50:36,750
for a penny,

1383
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,530
um, this could be weather data to identify

1384
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,590
delay risks or forecast

1385
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,750
or just check if you wanna go somewhere sunny,

1386
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,250
right? So

1387
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,269
We'll start zoomed out. This is the end

1388
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:50,280
to end architecture.

1389
00:50:50,628 --> 00:50:52,668
So in the left side we have the

1390
00:50:52,668 --> 00:50:53,909
travel agent AI

1391
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,469
and this is going to be powered by a server wallet

1392
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:58,590
using nitro enclaves from

1393
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,269
Coinbase,

1394
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,938
and agent kit from Coinbase that's interacting

1395
00:51:01,938 --> 00:51:03,309
with our Bedrock AI agent.

1396
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:06,349
In the middle, we have our data provider or merchant.

1397
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,648
They're going to be providing the API or the

1398
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,208
weather data map services,

1399
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,969
and then we have the rails, which is that facilitation

1400
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,429
layer that Eric was talking about.

1401
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:18,039
Since we're going to do crypto data payments, we just look

1402
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:20,478
at the foundation first, right, secure wallets

1403
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:21,820
using the giant enclaves.

1404
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,789
Um, I'm not going to

1405
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:26,929
spend a long time here, but we do have a blog written

1406
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:28,949
with Coinbase on our AWS site,

1407
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,889
um, which I can, I can send or share.

1408
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:33,369
We might have, we have a QR at the end with that.

1409
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,889
Um, but this is the architecture Coinbase uses

1410
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:37,949
on AWS to power their server wallet.

1411
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,449
Um, when a developer wants to create a wallet or sign

1412
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:41,188
a transaction,

1413
00:51:41,728 --> 00:51:43,760
it's going to follow this workflow through the API

1414
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,168
gateway. The request is passed to a secure signer

1415
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,829
inside of this enclave,

1416
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,449
and neither Coinbase or AWS operators

1417
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:51,639
can access those keys.

1418
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:54,418
This wallet provides a secure foundation

1419
00:51:54,668 --> 00:51:56,978
for us to build and enable crypto payments.

1420
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:58,570
Now we just have to connect to it.

1421
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:00,128
So Agent Kit

1422
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:02,188
works with the Bedrock AI agent.

1423
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:05,239
And this is the architecture we're gonna talk about today.

1424
00:52:05,648 --> 00:52:07,478
This is the architecture powering

1425
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,918
that AI agent,

1426
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,579
and it uses Agent Kit to access that secure

1427
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,800
wallet. So you see Agent Kit here on the right side,

1428
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,559
uh, in that gateway,

1429
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,639
but, but starting up here,

1430
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:19,938
um, there's a supervisor agent,

1431
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:22,369
and this could be any multi-agent workflow, this is just

1432
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:24,458
an example. We have a supervisor agent

1433
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,179
running in Agent Corp run time.

1434
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:28,938
And it's going to interact with an itinerary

1435
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,949
agent that manages the memory and planning for the

1436
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,978
travel, and it's going to make assumptions. It's

1437
00:52:32,978 --> 00:52:33,639
going to say

1438
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:36,219
we need to find a hotel in this place because we've

1439
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,260
confirmed that place is good, right? We want to go there, so

1440
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,059
we want to confirm that we have availability.

1441
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,570
So it's going to run those assumptions by the tool agent.

1442
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:45,340
The tool agent is going to use AG Core Gateway.

1443
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:46,648
To

1444
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,289
look through its available tools. Some of these tools

1445
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:51,320
might be directly registered with Agent Core Gateway,

1446
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:54,010
but there might be external MCP

1447
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,349
servers outside of the account,

1448
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,090
right? This could be X42 MCP servers

1449
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,309
or maybe even some kind of universal

1450
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,688
travel MCP server run by an existing

1451
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:04,168
travel company or travel agency.

1452
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,059
So if we look at the end to end path, the tool

1453
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,559
agent is going to

1454
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,898
call Agent Core Gateway. It's going to

1455
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:12,398
call the X42MCP server

1456
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:14,739
through Agent Core Gateway, and then it's going to

1457
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:16,860
access the data it needs, and it's going to pay for it via

1458
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,239
X42, and it's going to be able to leverage

1459
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,199
the wallet that it has

1460
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:23,898
through Agent Kit, which is also registered to the gateway.

1461
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:28,458
So that's the AI agent

1462
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,840
side, but we can actually go look at

1463
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:32,978
the other side on AWS, right? If

1464
00:53:32,978 --> 00:53:35,139
you are a data provider, let's say you're the service that's

1465
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:37,300
providing that weather data, that's providing that map

1466
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,409
data. Remember, these

1467
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:41,510
are the entities that are providing the flight scheduling,

1468
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:42,458
the distribution.

1469
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,099
There is an opportunity for these,

1470
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:47,300
these customers on AWS to also

1471
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,378
start to monetize their data in new ways for

1472
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:50,878
new workflows and

1473
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:52,438
not rely on

1474
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:55,139
existing bundled and subscription ways to pay

1475
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:55,938
for those services.

1476
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,378
Using the bridge bridge of X402.

1477
00:53:59,628 --> 00:54:01,628
So just to put our position on the

1478
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:03,628
map here, this is the architecture from the other

1479
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:05,668
perspective. We have some overlap with Agent Corp

1480
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:07,909
gateway. We see the same X402

1481
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:09,849
MCP server that we saw previously.

1482
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,500
Um, this is just to place us. So it

1483
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,179
has the

1484
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:15,590
agent kit and the X402 MCP server

1485
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,530
registered as a tool.

1486
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,559
Once this passes through that layer,

1487
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:22,550
Um, it's going to go through the CDN,

1488
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:23,500
which is cloud front,

1489
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:25,949
and it's going to go to a lambda function

1490
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:27,570
that we have here, lambda edge,

1491
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,530
as a viewer request, right?

1492
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:32,929
And this viewer request is going to,

1493
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:35,829
it, it may initially not have payment

1494
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:38,309
information. So this lambda function

1495
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,648
is going to send back requests

1496
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:42,679
saying, hey, this content actually has to

1497
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:43,360
be paid for,

1498
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:46,090
right? So where you need the header that

1499
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,489
shows that it needs to paid for, it's going to specify

1500
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:49,128
the asset,

1501
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:49,949
the network,

1502
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,409
up to parameters like Eric was talking about, and the

1503
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:53,949
client can retry the request.

1504
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:55,469
If the payment header

1505
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:57,889
is present, it's going to ask the

1506
00:54:57,889 --> 00:54:58,829
facilitator

1507
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:00,059
to verify.

1508
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:02,489
It's going to say, hey, is this payment going to work?

1509
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:03,989
Is this payment going to go through?

1510
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,280
Is this address valid?

1511
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:07,030
If that's valid,

1512
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:09,418
the X42 function can respond back to

1513
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:11,360
the server and make the request.

1514
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,320
And then ultimately it can,

1515
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:15,938
the, the, the agent can

1516
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:16,978
issue the correct payment.

1517
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:22,429
At the end of the workflow, it can forward the request back to the

1518
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:24,780
origin, in this case our EC2 web server

1519
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:27,329
that hosts the satellite weather images or JSON

1520
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:29,688
weather data or whatever data the travel agent needs.

1521
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,269
And at this point, the agent has requested weather

1522
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,369
data. It has been paid for

1523
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:36,320
by their connected wallet via agent Kit,

1524
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,750
and the merchant has been prompted for the

1525
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,550
accepted payment

1526
00:55:39,938 --> 00:55:40,750
via the X

1527
00:55:41,188 --> 00:55:43,260
has prompted for it and then received the accepted payment over

1528
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,949
X402 into their own wallet.

1529
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:47,070
Facilitator handles the settlement

1530
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,389
and on the blockchain, and the funds arrive in the crypto

1531
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,030
wallet of the merchant.

1532
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:55,760
So We also have some

1533
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,869
additional resources, blogs, things like that,

1534
00:55:57,909 --> 00:55:59,938
um, the agent core docs

1535
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:02,429
will show you what I was talking about earlier about observability,

1536
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:03,099
identity,

1537
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,030
um, runtime gateway, and you can get familiar

1538
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,500
with those primitives. We also have a blog

1539
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,809
that we've jointly written with Coinbase going in deep

1540
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:12,188
into the, um,

1541
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,860
the nitro enclaves-based wallet that we used,

1542
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,989
and we have a link here to CDP's documentation.

1543
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,429
This covers X402, Agent

1544
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:22,179
among other other services that they offer.

1545
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:25,519
And with that, thank you so much for your time I hope

1546
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,590
you enjoyed the talk and uh have a good rest of your weekend.
