1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,083
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,350
Excited to be here.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you all for coming for our session

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,300
about vulnerability
management in the cloud.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,230
My name is Amos, I'm a
product manager for Tenable.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,920
And before I start so
I know my crowd a bit,

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,840
which one of you, by a show of hands,

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,140
is familiar with Tenable

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,010
and Tenable VM

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,213
and Tenable Cloud Security?

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,180
Cool.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,463
So let's start.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,070
So what are we going to talk about today?

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,740
We'll start about speaking
about the challenges

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,930
and the different complexities

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,270
of vulnerability management in the cloud

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,773
and why is it different from
doing the same on premises?

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,250
We'll talk about Tenable

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,110
and specifically Tenable Cloud Security

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,250
and why I believe we are a
great partner for you to have

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,673
for the vulnerability
management program in the cloud.

22
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:08,910
And also about our brand
new, I think two weeks old,

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,280
Cloud VM offering that is really unique

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,323
and can solve a lot of your problems.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,063
And obviously, we'll see it
in action with a live demo.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,060
So there are many challenges
for vulnerability management,

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,760
but right now we'll focus on the cloud

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,573
and why is it different than
the standard challenges of VM?

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,860
So the cloud has unique workloads

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,283
with unique workload lifecycle,
especially containers.

31
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,170
Their images are stored
in container repositories.

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,290
They are spun up, taken
down. They're very ephemeral.

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,150
They change all the time,

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,840
which creates challenges of visibility.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,940
It's hard to know what's going on.

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,360
And these visibility challenges
make it really, really hard

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,290
to operationalize agent-based solutions.

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,550
It's hard to deploy everything.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,270
It's hard to manage everything
to create decent coverage.

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,783
So this solution basically
don't really work in the cloud.

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,100
On top of that, cloud
environments are very complex.

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,960
They have tons of different resources,

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,510
tons of different services.

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,910
Each one has its own configuration,

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,510
which creates a very non-trivial context

46
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,040
for the vulnerabilities.

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,980
And you must know the context

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,740
to prioritize the vulnerabilities as well.

49
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,020
So you have the challenges for the cloud,

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,380
but it becomes even more
complex when you combine it

51
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,380
with also managing
vulnerabilities on-prem.

52
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,530
It's hard to have one
solution to answer all

53
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,930
of these challenges and
the on-prem challenges.

54
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,680
So most solutions only do one of them,

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,783
so it's hard to solve both.

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,530
So we have challenges.

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,960
Why I believe we're a great vendor

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,850
to solve these challenges.

59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,200
So Tenable is a leader

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,790
for over two decades in the
vulnerability management domain.

61
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,173
And why is that?

62
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,493
We have a really, really good
vulnerability intelligence,

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,840
which helps you prioritize
what vulnerabilities you need

64
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,500
to solve first.

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,840
CVSS isn't really good at doing that.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,040
60% of CVEs have CVSS
that is high or critical.

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,310
So basically you can't
prioritize based on CVSS.

68
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,460
And with Tenable's
vulnerability priority rating

69
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,940
or proprietary scoring for
CVEs, it's more than an order

70
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,920
of magnitude lower than that.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,660
So it's really easy to know

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,480
what you should do first, where to focus.

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,560
And you might ask yourself,

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,790
all right, what you doing there?

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,200
How do you prioritize?

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,180
So we take many different risk factors,

77
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,180
including knowing what real
threat actors do and where.

78
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,350
And you push all of these factors

79
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,620
into our proprietary
machine learning engine

80
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,880
and it creates a new scoring,

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,893
which is much, much more accurate.

82
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,370
On top of help you prioritize,

83
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,503
we also help you remediate,

84
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,430
we also help you remediate
efficiently with our plugin IDs.

85
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,583
What's a plugin?

86
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,600
A plugin is a grouping of CVEs

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,790
where we tell you that
with a single action.

88
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,080
What's an action?

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,360
Like a software update or a patch,

90
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,760
you can solve multiple CVEs.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,810
So if we tell you if you
operate this version,

92
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,610
you only solve one CVE,

93
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,610
but if you do this, you solve
20 with a single action.

94
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,610
You obviously want to start
with solving 20 CVEs at a time.

95
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,110
And it helps you create

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,833
a more efficient remediation program.

97
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,910
So for over two decades,

98
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,890
we did great vulnerability management,

99
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,450
but in the recent years,

100
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,907
Tenable also became a
very important player

101
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,050
in the cloud security market

102
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,803
and the exposure management market.

103
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,510
So let's talk a bit about
our cloud security solution.

104
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,353
Just one sec.

105
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,090
Yeah, so Tenable Cloud Security

106
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,820
connects your cloud environment
or cloud environments,

107
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,730
even multi-cloud environments,

108
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,720
and basically reads everything

109
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:36,180
and help you create an
inventory of what you have there

110
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,680
and where your risk lies over there.

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,680
We look at everything
from IAM configuration,

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,680
data assets, obviously vulnerabilities

113
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,890
and create a unified view of the risk

114
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,420
and the different context for everything.

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,710
And why should you care

116
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,920
even if you care mostly
about vulnerabilities?

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,997
We can take a look at this.

118
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:02,250
You can see the toxic
combination over there

119
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,850
with the red rectangle where you can see

120
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,920
that we don't only show
you vulnerabilities,

121
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,210
we show you the context.

122
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,950
We take everything we learn from the cloud

123
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,750
as a context for vulnerabilities.

124
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,270
If you read the first one, we tell you

125
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,460
that you have critical vulnerabilities,

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,360
but these vulnerabilities
are also on workloads

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,610
that face the public internet

128
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,940
and they also have high privileges.

129
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,363
So these are the vulnerabilities
you want to solve first.

130
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,450
Obviously they're much more
important than vulnerabilities

131
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,823
and assets that don't
see the internet at all.

132
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,560
And once you know all of your cloud risk,

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,980
you want to push it into our
exposure management platform,

134
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,620
Tenable One, recently selected by Gartner

135
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,050
and Forrester as the number one leader

136
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,520
in exposure management.

137
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,650
And what's exposure management?

138
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,000
You have many, many different
tools I assume that collect

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,480
and analyze risks in different
places of your environment,

140
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,720
cloud, on-prem, OT, whatever.

141
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,720
And you want to have a
centralized single pane of glass

142
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,530
to see all the risk.

143
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,730
And this is Tenable One.

144
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,857
We normalize the information

145
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:17,640
and create a unified risk view.

146
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,123
So we'll see it in action a bit later.

147
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,230
And now I'm really, really happy

148
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,450
to talk about our new offering.

149
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,920
As I said, it's only two
weeks old, for Cloud VM.

150
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,720
Why did we build this offering?

151
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,010
So we talked to many VM professionals

152
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,100
and they told us, "All
right, we understand

153
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,120
what you're doing in the cloud.

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,030
Your CNAPP cloud security
platform is great.

155
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,510
We see it provides a lot
of interesting insights,

156
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,530
but we want to start more focused

157
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,330
on vulnerability management.

158
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,160
So we may get there a bit later,

159
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,470
but we want more lightweight solution

160
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,630
that only solve these specific problems

161
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,360
and we listened and we did it.

162
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,910
So Cloud VM is lightweight solution

163
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,200
focusing on vulnerability
management in the cloud.

164
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,270
What use cases are we trying to solve?

165
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,180
So first of all, you
have assets in the cloud.

166
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,120
You want to know what
vulnerabilities they have.

167
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,817
We do it relying on the
same vulnerability database

168
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:24,843
that we talked about before.

169
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,790
We can support migration
from on-prem to cloud

170
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,490
because you want to have,
during this process,

171
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,970
it can be challenging to
have a view, continuous view

172
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,180
of what's the current state of your risk.

173
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,673
And with this offering, you can do it.

174
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,940
And once you have a hybrid environment,

175
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,010
you want to have a single pane
of glass to see all your risk

176
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,990
of everything from your
on-prem environment

177
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,870
and in the cloud with a unified view.

178
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,723
So all these use cases are supported here.

179
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,870
And now let's dive into the offering

180
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,220
and what we're doing there.

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,807
So in the cloud, two
major types of workloads,

182
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,170
VMs and containers.

183
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,470
Containers are more standard,
more similar to on-prem.

184
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,980
So we'll focus on containers
that are more unique

185
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,813
to the cloud.

186
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,730
Containers have a unique lifecycle.

187
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,850
They start as a Dockerfile
in your code repo

188
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,210
then you build the image

189
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,300
and push it into a test
container repository,

190
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,760
container registry, you test it,

191
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,520
and then when everything
is good, you push it

192
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,630
to your production registry
and into production.

193
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,610
And we believe that you
need to analyze the risk

194
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,340
and to surface it as early as possible.

195
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,500
You don't need to wait to
runtime, you need to do it

196
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,200
as shiftless as possible
because it's easier to fix.

197
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,027
So our solution analyzes the
risk from the test registries

198
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,600
all the way to runtime

199
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,420
because you always want
to check also all the way

200
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,640
to the right because this
is what's actually running

201
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,930
and maybe you missed something

202
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,280
when you scanned the registries

203
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,833
and you want to see
what's going on in there.

204
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,343
So let's dive another step inside.

205
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,380
We do all of it agentlessly.

206
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,350
As I said, agent in the
cloud is problematic.

207
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,090
It's how to deploy.

208
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,820
So we scan without an
agent, you just connect us

209
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,310
to your cloud environment
and it's very short.

210
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,540
It takes minutes.

211
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,990
And we scan the workloads,

212
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,970
both VMs and containers.

213
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,973
We create a comprehensive
software inventory.

214
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,690
And from the inventory with
the vulnerability database,

215
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,045
we create a list of all
the CVEs that you have

216
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,793
in your environment.

217
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,600
On top of doing the runtime analysis,

218
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,150
we connect to your image registries,

219
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,130
the container image registries,

220
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,660
and we analyze them.

221
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,673
So with the Cloud Connector,

222
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,920
we can scan ECR repositories,
but we don't stop there.

223
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,170
We can also connect to third-party repos.

224
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,790
You can connect that there,
provide the relevant permissions

225
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,040
and we can read the images from there,

226
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,220
but also correlate them to
what we found on runtime.

227
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,203
So it's not separate.

228
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,030
And once we have all

229
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,030
of the information from
all the vulnerability

230
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,800
that we found in the repositories

231
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,680
and in runtime, we combine it also

232
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,140
with our exposure management
platform to combine it

233
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,050
with the vulnerability
findings from other places

234
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,680
in your organization, not just the cloud.

235
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,463
We'll see it again in
a demo right about now.

236
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,650
Yeah, so now let's see it in action

237
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,440
and I'll apologize in advance.

238
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,630
The video controls are a bit challenging,

239
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,730
so I hope it goes smoothly.

240
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,293
But if not, bear with me.

241
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,233
Oh yeah, you see, I told you.

242
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,363
Yeah.

243
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,963
Yeah.

244
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,553
Yeah, so here you can see the dashboard.

245
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,240
Oh yeah, you can see the dashboard,

246
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
you can see the different trends,

247
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,380
you have here how many
vulnerabilities do you have

248
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,000
in your environment?

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,630
You can see the MTTR analysis
based on the severity.

250
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,280
And on the bottom,

251
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,190
you can see different
aggregations by different factors

252
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,790
of the vulnerabilities we
found in your environment.

253
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,660
So you can see the inventory.

254
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Here we first focus on the
container repositories.

255
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,640
You can see here the list

256
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,440
of many, many different
repositories we're connected to.

257
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,280
Let's click one of the images

258
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,150
and see the findings
we found on the image.

259
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,583
We'll start with vulnerability findings.

260
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,090
You click here and you see a full list

261
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,170
of what we found on this image,

262
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,930
all the vulnerabilities, a
lot of information about it.

263
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,250
We don't stop with vulnerabilities.

264
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,240
We also scan for malicious
files we found there

265
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,073
on the image.

266
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,480
Here you can see, for
example, Metasploit files

267
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,630
that have no business on
being on production images.

268
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,123
And we found them on this container.

269
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,200
Now, after we saw findings
on container images,

270
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,700
we can see findings on actual
workloads found on runtime.

271
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,910
Here we look at VMs with
vulnerabilities in them.

272
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,830
You can see we found many resources.

273
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,710
We'll choose one of them
that has vulnerabilities

274
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,880
and you can see an overview

275
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,460
of what we found there on this workload.

276
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,350
Here, again, a full
list of vulnerabilities

277
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,190
on this runtime workload

278
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,990
and the full software inventory,

279
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,030
whether vulnerable or not vulnerable.

280
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,290
And if you find malicious files,

281
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,060
you can also see them there.

282
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,750
And the next very important
view is a full view

283
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,360
of all the vulnerabilities
we found in your environment.

284
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,960
You can filter them, for
example, by a specific account

285
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,280
and by severity.

286
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,830
So you can focus on the
things that you really want

287
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,433
to solve first, high and
critical vulnerabilities.

288
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,630
And not only that, for
example, let's take the case

289
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,727
where your sister called you, told you,

290
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,877
"My friend told me
there's this new attack,

291
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,630
new vulnerability, it's called Zerologon.

292
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,740
Are we impacted?"

293
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,883
So you can go here,

294
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,510
look for the new threat by name, Zerologon

295
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,673
and you see where we found
it in your environment.

296
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,510
Yeah, here you can see
the different scores,

297
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,243
both VPR and and CVSS.

298
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,210
Here you can see the
different risk factors we take

299
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,403
into account when calculating the VPR.

300
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,270
And yeah.

301
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,140
And at the bottom, you
see the real-world events,

302
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,760
the different things attacker did

303
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,340
that impact also the severity
and the trend over time.

304
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,440
The VPR can be reduced

305
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,960
and then increased according

306
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,123
to the real-world events that we found.

307
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,500
You can also view it as a timeline

308
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,840
and if you click it,
you get more information

309
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,363
about the event that we're talking about.

310
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,540
On top of that, you can
also search by CVE ID

311
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,977
and see the information
about the specific CVE.

312
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,980
And you can see the impact
it has on your environment,

313
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,630
where you found this CVE.

314
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,970
You can see the full
list of all VMs impacted

315
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,173
by this vulnerability.

316
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,620
And also all container images

317
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,210
and also software packages

318
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,063
that have this vulnerability in runtime.

319
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,140
Now we're moving to Tenable One,

320
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,300
our exposure management platform.

321
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,660
Here you see a unified
view of the exposure

322
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,460
of the risk you have across all

323
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,110
of your environment, not just cloud.

324
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,530
You can see also OT, web
application scanning,

325
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,830
whatever sources you have
for risk and vulnerabilities.

326
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,040
But you can also look
at per exposure type,

327
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,743
per category, per source.

328
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,810
You have also unified inventory
of all of your assets.

329
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,700
And what's really, really cool here

330
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,320
is that you have the AES,
the asset exposure score

331
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,780
that normalizes the risk

332
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,260
for all your assets into
one prioritized list,

333
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,940
which is really nontrivial

334
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,550
because usually you must
go to different tools.

335
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,310
They say this is important.
They say that is important.

336
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,050
How do I know what's most important?

337
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,050
Here you look at this with this score.

338
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,060
And once you have this
unified score for everything,

339
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,710
you can create programs

340
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,190
that take into account
risks from different places.

341
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,090
So let's look at cloud migration
that we mentioned before.

342
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,900
We can tag some resources
as related to migration,

343
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,810
some from the still on-prem,
some already in the cloud,

344
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,040
and they are tagged.

345
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,210
And once they are tagged,

346
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,560
you can create a card,

347
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,443
it lets you monitor this
program, this project.

348
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,480
Here you have an overview.

349
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,140
You can see the custom view
we created for this project,

350
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,460
for these tags.

351
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,600
And you get many metrics

352
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,700
that give you very, very deep visibility

353
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,240
on the current risk and
the trends over time.

354
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,430
And where the risk lies,
whether it's still on prem

355
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,120
or is it mostly on the ones

356
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,890
that already moved to the cloud.

357
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,350
And you can see a dashboard
that you can really customize

358
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,240
to show whatever you want,

359
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,140
to follow different metrics
you really, really care about.

360
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,030
Cool. So this is the demo.

361
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,180
And before leaving,
let's focus on the things

362
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,380
that I really want you to remember

363
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,370
once you leave this meeting.

364
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,183
So I talked a lot. So these
are the most important things.

365
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,093
So yeah.

366
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,670
If you haven't already,

367
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,620
you really should do vulnerability
management in the cloud

368
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,410
because it has vulnerabilities.

369
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,240
You should get ahold of them
and see what's important,

370
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,070
what's less important.

371
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,153
When you do it,

372
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:49,110
it's really, really better if you do it

373
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,110
with a unified program for VM in on-prem

374
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,610
and in the cloud.

375
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,650
And to do it, it's better
to do it with a vendor

376
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,540
that has really deep expertise,

377
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,020
both in vulnerability
management and in the cloud.

378
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,903
And I think we're such a vendor.

379
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,200
Remember that we have a brand new offering

380
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,680
for vulnerability management in the cloud

381
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,000
that is lightweight, that is
first step into the cloud.

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,640
And if you want to hear more about this

383
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,290
or anything Tenable, feel
free to come to our booth, 251

384
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,700
It's just click over there.

385
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,190
So I'll be there and
other people will be there

386
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,410
and will be happy to answer
any of your questions.

387
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,540
And I'll also be around here

388
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,760
if you want to ask anything now.

389
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,673
So thank you very much.
