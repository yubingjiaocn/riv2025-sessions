1
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:02,887
- [Abbas] Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:05,370
- [MICHAEL] Good afternoon.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,098
- How's everyone doing?

4
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:09,630
- Great.
- Great, awesome.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,840
Well, thank you for joining us here today.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,300
This is, I appreciate the time.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,469
This is live streamed and recorded,

8
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:20,910
and just looking forward
to a real discussion

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,550
on healthcare and all the new innovations

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,440
going on in AI and agents.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,360
And we're, this is not
one of those sessions

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,250
where we will not bring up AI, right?

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,010
I mean, this is front and
center in our lives right now.

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,687
So first of all, it's a
privilege to be back here.

15
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:39,150
This is our fourth year in
a row we've been doing this

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,100
and I'm humbled to be here

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,580
with four esteemed leaders
at four organizations,

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,120
representing 16 of our states in the US.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,310
And without further ado,

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,860
let me start with introductions.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,458
Mike, do you wanna just
introduce yourself,

22
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,784
your organization, and span of control?

23
00:00:57,784 --> 00:00:59,613
- Sure, thanks, Abbas.

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,850
Mike Regan, I'm the
chief technology officer

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,440
for Banner Healthcare.

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,108
I'm kind of responsible for
traditional IT digital data

27
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:11,447
and all tech ventures.

28
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,660
I just finished my year and a half,

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,910
so I guess now it's all my responsibility.

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,667
I can't, you know, claim I inherited it.

31
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,810
But I've been in healthcare
for over 20 years,

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,000
and been with four great organizations

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680
before joining Banner,

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,130
started my career at
Providence Health and Services.

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,140
Went to Cleveland Clinic and was CIO

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,810
of their international site
at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.

37
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,340
And then went and learned
the payer side of healthcare

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,488
with Sentara in Virginia.

39
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:42,180
And most recently, before joining

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,120
Banner Sharp Healthcare in San Diego,

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,953
really honored to be here

42
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,603
with a great bunch of colleagues here.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,753
- Geoff.

44
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:51,840
- Good afternoon, Geoff Hook,

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,130
I'm the chief information officer

46
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,860
for Nuvance Health in
New York and Connecticut.

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,507
We are now part of Northwell,

48
00:01:57,507 --> 00:02:00,213
and so my span of responsibilities are

49
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:02,820
data, AI, analytic security

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,590
and the overall technology stack

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,050
for the legacy organizations.

52
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,066
We look to see how we
bring the organizations,

53
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,636
between Northwell Nuvance together,

54
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:15,690
my history is IT and process
improvement and statistics.

55
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,046
So I love what AI and
data is doing for us.

56
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:20,880
I just wish we could figure out

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,373
how to make it more practical.

58
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,860
- Good afternoon, everyone, Raj Nair,

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,620
CIF for WellSense Health Plan.

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,070
We are based out of
Massachusetts and New Hampshire,

61
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,650
part of Boston Medical Center.

62
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,680
In addition to CIO responsibilities
for the health plan,

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm also part of

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,600
the Boston Medical Center
technology leadership.

65
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,760
You know, overall team.

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,080
Super excited to be here.

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,290
My second time doing the panel,

68
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,790
after last year, I wasn't sure

69
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,920
Abbas will invite me back, so.

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
- His nickname from last
year is, Ruthless Raj.

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,393
So I'm just gonna call
you out there again.

72
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:01,738
- And I'll echo what Mike said.

73
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:03,727
It's a privilege to be here

74
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,720
with some awesome leaders, here.

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,106
- Now I know I'm setting at the end

76
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,930
of the line next to him.

77
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,130
Hey, good afternoon everybody.

78
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,380
Andy Crowder, chief AI and digital officer

79
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,080
for Advocate Health, Advocate
Health is a new name.

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,990
It's a merger of Atrium
Health and Advocate Aurora.

81
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,480
We're now the third largest
health system in the US,

82
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,480
with 165,000 teammates,
we operate in nine states,

83
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,520
over 10,000 providers and about
75 healthcare, 75 hospitals.

84
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,790
I oversee all digital
solutions, software development,

85
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,270
APP dev, strategic partnerships,

86
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,980
direct-to-consumer digital initiatives,

87
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,800
and the overarching AI
strategy for the health system.

88
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,633
Nice to be here.

89
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:48,360
- Wonderful, and just a
quick intro on myself,

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,624
Abbas Mooraj, I'm based out of Boston.

91
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:52,436
I'm a proud alum of

92
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:55,650
Mass Gen Brigham and
Optum, part of United.

93
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,010
And I've been, I serve as
the cloud data and AI leader

94
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,590
for health services for PwC.

95
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,338
All right so, let's get into it.

96
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:07,530
This is gonna be, we're
gonna go on a journey from,

97
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,870
how do we even get to AI, right?

98
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,940
There's no good AI without good data.

99
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,410
You heard Matt Garman,

100
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,960
you've heard many leaders
talk about that today,

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,793
we're gonna talk a little bit

102
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,788
about the new announcements
that Matt and team made.

103
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:23,730
Can't wait for Swami's keynote
tomorrow morning, as well.

104
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,030
And then we're also gonna
talk about the value creation,

105
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,690
value realization of
AI at a health system,

106
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,520
which is in dire, dire needs

107
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,820
of not just modernization,
but there's so many margin,

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,320
there's so much margin pressure.

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,960
There's now tons of regulatory pressure,

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,900
even more regulatory pressure
over the next three years.

111
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,610
Health systems are gonna have to adapt,

112
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,210
they're gonna have to
leapfrog in a number of ways,

113
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,940
and to get there, and
to thrive in the next,

114
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,130
or in the next three to five years.

115
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,920
Right, so let's start
with the data journey.

116
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,020
So Geoff, I'm gonna pick on you,

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,500
since we have your chief data officer

118
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,833
in the audience, as well.

119
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,980
Talk to us about your data journey.

120
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,933
You started early, and which
was so refreshing to hear.

121
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,180
Tell us about your data journey

122
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,410
from 2020, 2021, what you've done on AWS

123
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,970
and where you are today.

124
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,770
- Sure, thanks Abbas.

125
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,420
And this is my fourth time doing this.

126
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,410
So if it gets stale, Abbas will
have me booed off the stage.

127
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,440
We started our digital
journey based off data,

128
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,530
when we realized healthcare
data is in silos,

129
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,170
there's proprietary system,
whether it's your images,

130
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,360
whether it's your call centers,

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,540
go across the board, all
your data is in silos,

132
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,510
and each application
wants to keep that data,

133
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,490
and keep that data that way.

134
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,220
And so we realize that if
we're going to be successful,

135
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,470
we had to put our data into a single place

136
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,417
that was safe, was secure,

137
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,321
as well as it needed to be in the cloud.

138
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,150
For those of us who have
grown up in healthcare,

139
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,770
a lot of what we do is moving data

140
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,920
from point A to point B, and
then from point B to point C,

141
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,987
and then do it all again
when we change the system.

142
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:05,190
And so now it's about

143
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,900
bringing the logic to the data,

144
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,940
rather than the data to
the different systems.

145
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,729
And so, we put together

146
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,249
a high trust certified
cloud, AWS platform,

147
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,190
had it audited by third parties,

148
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,287
had it audited by second parties

149
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,540
and had it audited by
our own security teams.

150
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,950
And then we started looking at that of,

151
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,170
if we get the data there,
then that is the point

152
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,220
that we can start to work on

153
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,470
how we integrate with other platforms,

154
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,740
how we start to build our
own applications as well as,

155
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,360
as innovation comes along,

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,150
we have immediate access
to those innovations.

157
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,780
And so, although some of our AI adoption,

158
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,570
a lot of it is us trying
it on our own building

159
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,746
and fail quick, succeed quick,

160
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,947
the data is there for us to do that.

161
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:50,070
And so that was how we began our journey.

162
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,960
We were a very young system,

163
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,330
so granted me the
opportunity to start over,

164
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,460
because we didn't have any infrastructure,

165
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,227
except for some legacy systems.

166
00:06:58,227 --> 00:06:59,520
Had you have some more legacy,

167
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,260
I think the story might
be slightly different,

168
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,810
because you have significant
investments elsewhere.

169
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,290
- So what, Geoff, maybe
a quick follow up there.

170
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,670
Why, so you went with, just to get

171
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,340
the technology folks engaged
in the audience here.

172
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,862
You went with all native AWS you know,

173
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:25,410
what sort of was the
genesis of that decision

174
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,153
and any regrets?

175
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,731
- I think the genesis was, we want to,

176
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:35,190
the goal was to avoid technical debt.

177
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,860
Again, your teams are overhead expense

178
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,120
and I love my team members,

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,270
but I want them helping us
succeed, not having to babysit.

180
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,040
And so we did go as much
native AWS as we could,

181
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,840
in some instances that
was wildly successful.

182
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,270
In other instances, it's
been a partnership to say,

183
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,620
this isn't as good as we thought,

184
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,330
we're gonna have to go elsewhere.

185
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,420
And so, it really was about

186
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,690
trying to keep our limited resource

187
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,630
of a small organization
or smallish organization,

188
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,820
very efficient, very focused,

189
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,120
and then going outside of
that ecosystem when we had to,

190
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,580
rather than shopping for
the latest, greatest,

191
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,310
because that could then keep
us shopping all the time,

192
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,630
with lots of change in turnover.

193
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,730
And similarly, you already have your data,

194
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,750
you already have the systems,

195
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,080
it's just an activation
and code is infrastructure,

196
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,560
rather than, I need to buy
it, I need a new MSA, BAA

197
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,320
and every other legal document
that goes along with it.

198
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,830
- Yeah, right on, Raj,

199
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,590
let me go to you next, here.

200
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,820
So you are, you know, you walked into

201
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,931
a health system that had some, you know,

202
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,390
needed modernization on
the health plan side.

203
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,010
What was your thought journey?

204
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,650
And I, you know, we will
get into AI in a minute,

205
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,440
but like, you had the thought about

206
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,030
having a dual strategy on,

207
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,940
we need a modern data platform,

208
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,410
but we also need an AI factory.

209
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,300
So walk us through your logic,

210
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,580
and why, you know, why AWS?

211
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,140
What was your thought process there?

212
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,530
- Sure, so you know,
I've been in this role

213
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,213
for about two and a half years,

214
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,514
when I first came in and
I started looking, I mean,

215
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:14,514
if you don't do AI and automation anymore,

216
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,000
it's not just that, you know,
you're gonna fall behind,

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,090
but you simply will not be able to keep up

218
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,630
with the pace of change, the
regulatory changes, right?

219
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,080
And, you know, to do cost
optimization, all of that,

220
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,790
you need to be in the AI world anymore.

221
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,830
Now to do AI, like you
said, you need data.

222
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,034
So when I started looking at it,

223
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,020
I quickly realized that

224
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,540
this is gonna be a fun journey, right?

225
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,700
So, and what I mean by that is, like,

226
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,090
so we had numerous data warehouses,

227
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,260
one that we were lovingly
called, new data warehouse,

228
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,867
which was four or five
years in the making.

229
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,060
And it's a never ending project, right?

230
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,290
And the overall data quality
was like really, really bad.

231
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,350
Now, back in the day, I ran
the data warehouse practice

232
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,290
for KPMG and I've seen some horror shows.

233
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,610
This was like way, way
worse than any of that.

234
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,240
So, but in some ways that
made my decision easy to say,

235
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm not gonna worry about
trying to salvage this.

236
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,560
Let me just quickly start
a cloud modernization

237
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,940
and start, you know,

238
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,238
slowly decommissioning
these legacy assets, right?

239
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:31,530
But at the same time, I didn't wanna wait

240
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,180
'till a year, two years,

241
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,290
to have my data platform
where I want it to be,

242
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,210
to start the AI journey.

243
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,750
So then we started
looking at AI use cases,

244
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,419
where we had a high level of confidence

245
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:51,419
in the quality of data, or
the data were unstructured,

246
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,690
like, you know, documents
and things of that nature,

247
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,430
where we could go at it, right?

248
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,523
So that was sort of how we approached it.

249
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,300
- Mike, let me go to you.

250
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,070
You were, I'm gonna quote
your Banner data platform.

251
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,590
Maybe, can you talk to us
about your decision making?

252
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,930
Why did you make the decisions you made

253
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,793
and where you are now?

254
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,030
- You mean, just around the data platform?

255
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,963
- Yeah, the data platform.

256
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,583
- Okay yeah, you know, I think,

257
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,990
much like all of you in the
audience and my colleagues here,

258
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,300
you know, we've come from an environment

259
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,220
where we had kind of, one of everything

260
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,600
and we've had, you know,

261
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,170
multiple, you know, data
warehouses of the future, you know,

262
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,400
things you can buy off the shelf,

263
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
things we construct ourselves.

264
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,413
And I think we quickly
realized that we're moving

265
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:43,800
from kind of, this in a
highly regulated industry

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,340
that was very dependent upon,
you know, systems of record,

267
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,890
meaning that this EMR was like
the center of the universe,

268
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,090
and the ERP is the center of the universe,

269
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,410
and we're moving to a different time,

270
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,180
where infrastructure becomes

271
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,530
more of the center of the universe.

272
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,973
And so with that,

273
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,490
we really wanted our
data all in one place,

274
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,170
and we wanted it to be able to be prepped,

275
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,330
and be able to be acted upon by AI.

276
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,842
Whether we buy that
directly from partners,

277
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:08,130
or whether we wanted to have that,

278
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,600
something we construct ourselves

279
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,430
and we can drive competitive advantage.

280
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,920
And so, Banner data
platform is really kind of,

281
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,620
our vision for kind of,
putting all of our data

282
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,260
under one roof, one giant
lake house or, you know,

283
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,910
however you want to say that,

284
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,370
primarily on Databricks on AWS.

285
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,400
And so, there's a lot of layers
there, a lot of technology.

286
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,320
But, you know, we wanted
to drive observability.

287
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,940
We wanted to drive, you know,

288
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,800
a new generation of code development,

289
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,540
and kind of, a new generation of kind of,

290
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,160
software development practices.

291
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,190
And so, this is kind of foundational tech

292
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,830
that we have another three years to say

293
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,600
that we're gonna have it all done.

294
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,640
So, this year was really
about clinical data.

295
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,760
So we have, you know, I'd
say a majority, if not all,

296
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,260
it's not quite end of December yet.

297
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,290
So all of our clinical data in the,

298
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,980
in Databricks in real time,
being real time updated.

299
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,050
And so now we can act upon that.

300
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,000
A lot of that's curated,
you know, into a way

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
that we can actually use it for AI.

302
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,300
We've got a lot of do work to do

303
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,822
on our health plan side of
the business, to do that.

304
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,950
Same with kind of administrative data,

305
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,360
but those are the kind of, coming years.

306
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,920
And so we're tackling that as we have,

307
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,030
you know, as we go forward.

308
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,463
But I think the decision is that,

309
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,540
data is your, probably
your most important asset

310
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,430
of the future, you know,

311
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,870
I would say domain knowledge,

312
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,570
how your work happens at your organization

313
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,420
and data, all three of those
being really important assets

314
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,120
to the future, and so we
really want to prepare

315
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,413
and be able to capitalize on that,

316
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,900
along the way, you know,
we're doing everything we can

317
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,770
to keep pace with the transforming,
you know, landscape AI,

318
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,890
but it's hard, you
know, but things change,

319
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,870
or accelerating very quickly.

320
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,340
And so, you know,

321
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,842
thoughts that we had
about the data platform

322
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,760
at the beginning of this
year, they've already changed.

323
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
And so I think the right thing to do is

324
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,840
to make sure you have great partners.

325
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,670
- Yeah.
- You know, AWS and Databricks

326
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,930
have been particularly good,

327
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,000
because they've really evolved
with us on this journey,

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,053
and they really enable us
to kind of think, you know,

329
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:01,914
to that next level,

330
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:04,170
when we're really deploying, you know,

331
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,153
generative AI across the organization.

332
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,580
- Yeah, we're gonna get into AI,

333
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,460
but we have to, obviously we
cannot have a session here

334
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,660
without either talking about

335
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
OpenAI, Anthropic or, or Gemini for sure.

336
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,210
But Andy, let me ask you like, we were,

337
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,980
we've talked, I think Mike brought up

338
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,810
a word, infrastructure, right?

339
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,020
And we've talked about
governance, you know,

340
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,070
from an AI perspective,

341
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,470
you're the chief AI and digital officer,

342
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,160
governance, culture and
infrastructure, right?

343
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,040
And I think that is becoming,

344
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,683
just from even today's
session with Matt Garman,

345
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,800
vitally important, the
infrastructure piece.

346
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,020
I think people have realized,

347
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,630
I think executives and
boards are now realizing

348
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,760
that infrastructure,
without infrastructure,

349
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,960
we can't really do anything.

350
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
We can't really get into the workflow.

351
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,390
But what's your thought?

352
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,700
I mean, we, a year ago today, you know,

353
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,415
from here today, we were talking about

354
00:14:55,415 --> 00:15:00,270
ambient listening and imaging AI.

355
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,140
What have you done

356
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,710
at Advocate Health in
your AI journey so far?

357
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,750
- Yeah, so I think we realized,

358
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,190
and Mike brought it up, you know,

359
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,300
you've gotta be great

360
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,820
at the informatics and
the change management.

361
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,437
You've gotta have deep
knowledge of your data

362
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,030
and your clinical workflows.

363
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,070
You've gotta have a data
platform and the right security,

364
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,633
all of those things in place.

365
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:20,910
What I would say is,

366
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,510
the thing that has given us the most value

367
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,730
and speed to value quickest,

368
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,190
is our best place to care strategy,

369
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,190
which galvanizes, you know,
750 of our change champions

370
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,200
in clinical care with informaticist

371
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,580
and our AI development teams.

372
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,559
And so we go from pilot to full scale,

373
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,310
we think faster than most
because of that relationship,

374
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,040
and because of our governance structure,

375
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,030
although we're a new health
system, the third largest,

376
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,580
we have a centralized IRB,

377
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,410
a centralized governance structure,

378
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,420
and enterprise platforms and standards.

379
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,210
So we don't have, we spend a lot of time

380
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,770
on platform rationalization,

381
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,270
for the past three to five years.

382
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,150
And so we have less sources of that data

383
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,961
to get into the right place, curated.

384
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:14,580
And then, you know, when generative AI

385
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,410
exploded onto the landscape, you know,

386
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,630
two and a half, three years ago,

387
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,760
we focused a lot on the framework

388
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,790
for how we review it
and monitor it at scale,

389
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,410
closed-loop process, we actually
trademark that as fair AI,

390
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,372
we share it openly for
others to access and curate,

391
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:35,550
a closed-loop process,
multidisciplinary teams

392
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,080
that review those,

393
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,030
model cards for every single piece of AI

394
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,130
that we have in production,

395
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,830
models, watching models in
production, those type of things.

396
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,740
And we think that those competencies

397
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,930
in governance and change management

398
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,010
from informatics point of view,

399
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,790
allow us to go, and from
small pilot to full scale

400
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,290
very, very quick.

401
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,480
And our clinicians, you
know, it's interesting,

402
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,220
you would think that some
of the back office people

403
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,020
would be leading the charge.

404
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,970
Our clinicians are actually
leading this charge,

405
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,350
and now some of the back office areas

406
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,250
are trying to catch up.

407
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,750
So we're really excited about that.

408
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,720
And in the places where we've deployed it,

409
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,330
we've seen patient experience go up,

410
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,330
clinician experience go
up, turnover go down,

411
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,010
and we're starting to see the value

412
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,780
for these investments that we've made.

413
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,630
And we believe that the health systems,

414
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,510
and I think these health
systems are examples of that,

415
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,700
that make these investments now,

416
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,970
in all of those three
pillars of expertise,

417
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,627
we will differentiate ourselves

418
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,413
in markets and with our competitors,

419
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,390
pretty damn significantly
over the next 18 to 24 months.

420
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,320
We consider ourselves to be a
digital and AI first company,

421
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,090
and that'll be part of
our transformation agenda,

422
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,320
moving forward.

423
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,510
- Yeah, just Andy echoing that, I think,

424
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,158
I think the moves you made, for example,

425
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:53,430
for those who are not familiar
with the fair AI framework,

426
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,930
it is truly, we consider
it as well, best in class

427
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,530
and we should all, I think
it's, it is public, right?

428
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,040
- It is published, it is trademarked,

429
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,000
and it's out there for all to

430
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,920
contribute to and collaborate.
- Yeah, yeah but Andy,

431
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,450
just, I'm gonna dive deeper a little bit.

432
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,570
So, walk us through your
partnerships that you've had,

433
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,340
that you've built over
the last couple of years,

434
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,080
at least with, I'm just gonna throw,

435
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,330
Aidoc and a and a couple
of others as well.

436
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,520
Talk to us about the
partnerships you've made as well.

437
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,020
- Yeah, so it's interesting
because, you know,

438
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,430
before AI hit, you could
be in series A or B

439
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,080
and still have pretty significant

440
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,670
commercialization opportunities

441
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,050
or co-development opportunities.

442
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,760
Now, because of the volatility,

443
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,280
you've gotta get up to
early stage, early C,

444
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,570
to actually have the ability

445
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,950
to influence and do those things.

446
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,143
But I think Aidoc is a great example.

447
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:43,770
Huge AWS platform play for them.

448
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,510
We now have more medical
imaging AI at scale.

449
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,370
Aidoc says it's the largest in the world.

450
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,660
I don't know how they
quite come up with that,

451
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,910
but I'll take the accolades
on the stage with them.

452
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,092
We have 15 algorithms

453
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,153
in production today, foundation models,

454
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:02,190
and if you look at the
shortage for radiologists

455
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,500
and the burden and turnover
that's in that space,

456
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,610
I think, every radiologist

457
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,080
has three and a half to four jobs

458
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,550
when they come outta school.

459
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,250
And so we've seen the speed to treat,

460
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,230
and turnaround time
increase significantly,

461
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,000
where we have scarce resources.

462
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,130
And we're not just doing
that in radiology with Aidoc,

463
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,440
we're doing it in
pathology and cardiology,

464
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,460
and some of the other areas.

465
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,620
And it has profound impact.

466
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,750
You know, we've got cases
that we could highlight

467
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,250
of where it caught, on the
last three panes of a scan,

468
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,930
a PE or something like that,

469
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,430
would've gone totally undetected

470
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,710
and would've been life ending for someone.

471
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,110
And so we're really excited
about the benefits there.

472
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,150
Aidoc is a great example of that.

473
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,120
Aidoc actually serves as an advisor

474
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,800
to our board, and we do the same for them.

475
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,920
And we've got multiple other
vendors that we've bet on.

476
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,150
I do think it is about

477
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,400
picking the right partners in this space,

478
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,530
that you can co-develop and co-create,

479
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,480
and take it to scale.

480
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,535
- Wonderful, so maybe Raj,

481
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,120
I want to ask you your thoughts on this,

482
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,080
because you started, again, you
know, early in this journey,

483
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,860
you, you know, we talked
about an AI factory

484
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,330
and what does that mean to you?

485
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,240
And what is the construct for that

486
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,130
and what's the value realized?

487
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,200
How do you measure that, most importantly,

488
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,270
and how do you, you know, how do you,

489
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,440
and of course you've paired up,

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,910
I think the smartest thing was pairing up

491
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,470
with your chief operating officer,

492
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,680
but like, how, tell us about that journey.

493
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,390
- Sure, so you know, part
of, prior to this role,

494
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,367
I was at Optum for 12 years,

495
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,740
and one of the realization was that

496
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,190
you can't have, like to drive, you know,

497
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,910
enabling and transformative
capabilities like AI,

498
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,570
it cannot be just driven
by the technology leader.

499
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,630
You need a two-in-a-box type concept

500
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,380
with a business partner
who has skin in the game

501
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,750
and who is just as
committed as that, right?

502
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,970
So in this role, in the very beginning,

503
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,655
I roped in my chief operating officer

504
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:00,787
and I said that,

505
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:02,880
"Look, we have to do AI,

506
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,010
but we have to do it together," right?

507
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,410
And so that's been a great partnership.

508
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,570
The other aspect of our AI program

509
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,255
has been very, very focused
on value realization.

510
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:19,255
So we have a, we have about
40 use cases in production,

511
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,403
about 60, 70 in backlog, right?

512
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:28,440
The complete AI program
is fully self-funded,

513
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,473
and at this point as is returning 2X,

514
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,770
and in probably a couple months,

515
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,470
gonna be closer to 3X in,

516
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,320
you know, revenue generation, right?

517
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,310
So, and I'm sharing that
because with that mindset,

518
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,133
part of what I wanted to do was,

519
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,990
I'm very big, like, you know,

520
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,820
both Mike and Andy and everybody said,

521
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,060
on having strategic partners, right?

522
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,450
Like, I know that I
cannot do this on my own.

523
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,290
We are also a safety net health system,

524
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,800
so we don't have access to innovation labs

525
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,730
and deep pockets to
like go innovate, right?

526
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,030
So we've been very focused
on bringing in partners

527
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,213
who have that co-innovate,
co-develop mindset,

528
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:15,750
and it's been hugely successful for us.

529
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,010
So if you look at my teams,

530
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,250
you wouldn't know who my team members are,

531
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,260
versus who my partners are, right?

532
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,440
It's a really nicely formed team.

533
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,340
Now, the concept of, you know, AI factory

534
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,570
was very important for me,

535
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,590
because part of our
approach in AI also was,

536
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,980
once you prove out a
capability for a given use case

537
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,710
and it generates the value,

538
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,440
we started looking at the backlog to say,

539
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,210
what are the other use cases

540
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,440
where the same capability
could be applicable, right?

541
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,340
So then it's a rapid
deployment and you can scale,

542
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,430
but to do that you need
this AI factory model,

543
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,680
where you had dedicated paths

544
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,950
that can now take this
capability, tune it,

545
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,070
and rapidly deploy across these,

546
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,360
you know, use cases, right?

547
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,480
So while our AI program is only two years,

548
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,270
that is the reason why
we've been able to generate

549
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,240
almost, close to 3X in return.

550
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,793
We wouldn't have been
able to scale otherwise.

551
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,060
- Do you feel that your,

552
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,800
that your platform that you've built,

553
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,010
both on the data side and of
course the AI factory side,

554
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,190
you use a combination of, and you know,

555
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,560
I wanted to get this a real
conversation going about,

556
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,830
you use traditional AI,
you use generative AI,

557
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,610
you are multi-model, right?

558
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,040
- Yeah.
- You primarily use

559
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,960
Anthropic, right?
- Mhm.

560
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,500
- Claude, I think it's both 4.5 Opus

561
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,210
as well as Sonnet.

562
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,240
But do you feel that
you could do more there?

563
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,800
Like, what's your philosophy there on the,

564
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,720
on your LLM strategy?

565
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,905
- Yeah, so you know,

566
00:23:56,905 --> 00:24:00,303
I've approached this
with the mindset that,

567
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,033
I'm gonna be more focused
on like, solving problems.

568
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,033
- Yeah.

569
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:12,770
- And solving it with
the cheapest capability.

570
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,790
To be very candid with you,

571
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,190
that also has the ability

572
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,170
to scale to the extent that

573
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,330
we need to scale, right?
- Right.

574
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,330
- So as an example, there are, you know,

575
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,160
there are models that,

576
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,890
at Optum I would have to have used that,

577
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,113
because of the scale that I'm used to.

578
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,230
I don't need that here, right?

579
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,790
So we were able to find models

580
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,520
that is like, 100X
cheaper than that, right?

581
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,170
So if I'm being fully transparent,

582
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,210
like, cost is a big factor.

583
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,540
And you know, I also want
the ability like, you know,

584
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,530
Mike eluded to things,
things are changing so fast.

585
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,487
I don't wanna lock myself into.

586
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:52,740
- Mhm.
- Hey, this is

587
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,044
where I want to be.

588
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:56,700
I'm looking at like,
what's good enough today,

589
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,340
what gets me time to market, right?

590
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,100
Speed to value, that sort of thing.

591
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,530
And then I also wanna build it in a way,

592
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,040
where if tomorrow there's a better option,

593
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,300
I wanna be able to swap it
out with very limited impact,

594
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,250
and adopt the new capability, right?

595
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,460
So our whole philosophy has
been based on, you know,

596
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,898
everything that we built is
with that foundational mindset.

597
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:24,030
- Love it, love it, Geoff what,

598
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,440
so there's much going on

599
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,390
in the state of New York
and Connecticut, right?

600
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,178
Just, lots of legislation, regulatory,

601
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:33,270
both at the federal
and state level, right?

602
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,000
So what, and you're obviously part

603
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,580
of a much larger health system as well.

604
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,239
Where are you on your AI journey

605
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,110
and you know, talk about some use cases

606
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,380
that have really provided
some value to you,

607
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,250
and what's your plan for 26 at this point?

608
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,650
- Thanks, and so I think for,

609
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,810
I don't know how many of you in here

610
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,570
are familiar with the
healthcare industry as a whole,

611
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,630
but if you look at the
healthcare industry,

612
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,340
productivity in the healthcare industry

613
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,270
has stayed flat for decades
and decades and decades.

614
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,160
And if you look at other industries,

615
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,999
finance, manufacturing,
productivity increases

616
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,510
year over year.

617
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,340
And so as we look at,

618
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,350
and sorry for the economics lecture here,

619
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,400
but as you look at,
20% of the nation's GDP

620
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,170
is invested in healthcare,

621
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,010
yet productivity has not
changed over all these years.

622
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,151
AI has been the lever.

623
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:34,151
What is it, I just, archimedes,

624
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:35,910
"Give me a place to stand and a lever

625
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,900
and I can move the world."

626
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,060
Or at least I can move a few people.

627
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,290
And I probably butchered that,

628
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,850
and may have borrowed that from a movie

629
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,650
I just saw on the flight.

630
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,650
Anyways, so from from that standpoint,

631
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,350
I think AI is a great enabler,

632
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,150
and we are seeing productivity,

633
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,560
I think whether it's
back office, clinicians,

634
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,710
they also understand they
can't meet the demand.

635
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,353
I think Andy mentioned radiologists.

636
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,230
There's a shortage of radiologists,

637
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,490
there's a shortage of nurses,

638
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,420
there is a shortage of everything
in the healthcare world,

639
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,950
which means then expenses go up,

640
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,800
because you have to pay premium
dollars to recruit and keep.

641
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,110
And so if we're going to be
successful in this realm,

642
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,430
we have to make sure again,

643
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,970
we can exponentially improve

644
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,730
the productivity of a
radiologist with an Aidoc,

645
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,090
or look at the data and how do
we use ambient, again, older.

646
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,160
But we see that that has returned

647
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,380
and has increased patient experience.

648
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,890
And so where we're looking
at Nuvance in Northwell is,

649
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,100
how do we take the data
out of our numerous EHR's,

650
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,660
create that single lake,

651
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,340
and then start creating those rags

652
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,660
to bring that data forward?

653
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,390
And so we have several programs.

654
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,310
It's the monitoring
that I'm seeing a boss,

655
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,960
that we really need to do a better job.

656
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,197
Data must have a meaning.

657
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:53,400
I think all of us love collecting data.

658
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,950
Data's wonderful, but if
you don't know what it means

659
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,258
while it's sitting there for you,

660
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:02,160
the models are gonna
return erroneous content.

661
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,900
And so from that standpoint,

662
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,810
I mean your own,

663
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,880
I used Claude the other
day to ask a question,

664
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,850
and it told me the wrong
year and the wrong score

665
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,110
and the wrong everything.

666
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,700
And so if you have it wrong,

667
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,020
you won't get the right results,

668
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,640
which in healthcare will kill a patient.

669
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,410
So we're looking at very much,

670
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,170
how do we make sure that
our data is well governed,

671
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,100
our lake is very well manicured?

672
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,540
And then applying it to rags

673
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,090
so that we start to
reduce the amount of work

674
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,440
for tumor boards,

675
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,390
reduce the amount of work for registries.

676
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,710
And that's really where we're focusing,

677
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,730
is helping the clinicians

678
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,117
get some of their day and
some of their life back,

679
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,260
while also looking at
some of the back office,

680
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,300
'cause clearly that is a huge opportunity,

681
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,850
but as I think everyone's said it already,

682
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,687
you have to have the partners,

683
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:47,760
and the partners have to be ready

684
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,870
to partner with you.

685
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,140
And without that, you're going nowhere.

686
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,430
- Alright, I'm gonna put you on the spot.

687
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,263
- Please.

688
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,458
- What is, and this, I would've
waited for the future one,

689
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,370
but you brought up something
and I can't resist,

690
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,248
what is, I know you are working on,

691
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:04,170
you may be working on rev
cycle, if I'm not mistaken.

692
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,160
- Yes, sir.

693
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,990
- What is rev cycle looking?

694
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,963
Forget three years,
well, by the end of 2026.

695
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,050
- Oh, I love thinking about the future.

696
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,220
You're not, this is not the answer

697
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,750
you're looking for, boss.

698
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,150
Rev cycle is hand-to-hand combat.

699
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,703
Again, if you're familiar with healthcare,

700
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,280
it's hand-to-hand combat,

701
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,300
because the insurers take
money outta their pocket

702
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,648
and give it to you for services rendered.

703
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,517
- You mean Raj, you mean Raj.

704
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:34,848
- Insurers.

705
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,681
- Insurers.

706
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:36,514
- Insurers.
- And Raj.

707
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:38,397
- And Raj.
- Ruthless.

708
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:41,310
- Luckily, there's no state
overlap between you two, so.

709
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,760
- No, no, we're friendly most days.

710
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,030
So from, rev cycle going to
be about creating the agents

711
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,200
and creating the tools

712
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,890
to counter the very deep
pockets of the payers,

713
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,890
who also are incentivized
to deny your claims.

714
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,290
And Raj, I don't mean
that like, as a attack,

715
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,060
but it is very realistic,

716
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,650
because the more money
that sits in the bank,

717
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,330
you know this, the more it grows.

718
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,100
So by paying the surgery
cost for my new knee,

719
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,980
if I hold onto it a little bit
longer, that's more interest.

720
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,390
And so AI is going to be,

721
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,630
how do we get faster pre-authorizations?

722
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,030
How do we debate the denials,

723
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,280
and how do we take all our contracts

724
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,810
and maximize those contracts,

725
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,340
so we're getting paid what we should

726
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,440
for the services we render?

727
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,720
- Good answer, yeah.
- Thank you.

728
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,700
- Mike, so I'm gonna put you on the spot.

729
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,140
So you are doing, I happen
to know some inside baseball,

730
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,660
but you're doing some
extremely innovative stuff

731
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,590
in the AI space.

732
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,260
So, maybe talk about your AI journey

733
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,050
and what you're doing,
especially, you know,

734
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,400
especially with today's announcements

735
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,943
with Nova Sonic 2 and
what's happening there.

736
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,160
You know, AWS is itself
becoming an AI platform vendor,

737
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,918
versus an infrastructure provider, right?

738
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,870
So talk to us about what
Banner Health is doing there.

739
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,520
- Yeah, I think this, you know,

740
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,330
I love what Raj and
Andy were saying before

741
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,400
about a lot of the things
here about partnerships

742
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,100
and about, you know, lock-in
and so forth like this.

743
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,997
I think one of the key concepts, you know,

744
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:11,790
we recognized really early on,

745
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,219
was that data and process

746
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,972
and domain knowledge being what it is,

747
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:19,050
that when we think about AI,

748
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,850
we have to think about
it kind of end-to-end.

749
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,260
It's the answer to everything.

750
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,313
And that light took a long
time to go off in my head.

751
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:28,260
You know, you hear, oh, cloud code

752
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,953
can increase the productivity
it developed by 30%.

753
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:33,570
That's not really the
interesting part about it.

754
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,850
It's not really that there's
a productivity increase

755
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,790
or you're gonna, you know,
displace a certain function

756
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,780
or it's gonna, you know,

757
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,135
make something easier in rev cycle,

758
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:43,680
it's about thinking about that end-to-end.

759
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,420
And so it's like, you know,

760
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,260
I think when we were talking

761
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,900
with some of your colleagues
at PWC about, you know,

762
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,550
the early days in Amazon

763
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,710
when they kind of, automated
Java, you know, development,

764
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,690
and then they automated
the deployment of that,

765
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,070
and they automated the testing of it,

766
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,410
then they automated the
fixing of the testing.

767
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,080
And before long, there was
just a specification left,

768
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
and there was really no human in there,

769
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,900
but it was a kind of a complete,

770
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,760
end-to-end closed loop system.

771
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,040
And I think that's the kind
of journey that we're on

772
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,170
in healthcare, is to figure out,

773
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,200
how do we enable those
kinds of things to happen,

774
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,070
so that we can kind of,
automate that complete process?

775
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,000
And you know, we chose call center

776
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,590
as kind of, one of our
first areas to kind of,

777
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,810
really look at in that area.

778
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,340
And that's been at Nova Sonic,

779
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,460
we've been building on that
for a couple months now,

780
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,150
really kind of building
conversational AI at the front end.

781
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,920
And we've, you know, picked a couple of

782
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,060
really key use cases,

783
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,890
like how to, you know,
schedule appointment,

784
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,870
reschedule appointment,
cancel appointment,

785
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,703
all those kind of, calls

786
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:42,480
that kind of, come into a call center.

787
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,940
And we're really in the
process now of automating that

788
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,687
with conversational AI.

789
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:48,930
You know, my belief is,

790
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,640
call center isn't really just call center.

791
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,230
Call center is kind of everything.

792
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,220
When you think about, you know,

793
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,410
you're calling HR at your job,

794
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,730
or you're talking to supply chain,

795
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,100
you're doing anything inside your company,

796
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,720
it's really kind of,
acts like a call center.

797
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,520
You're going and talking
to another human being.

798
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,950
You're trading information,
you're getting answer.

799
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,386
A lot of that's gonna be automated

800
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,880
through the use of conversational AI.

801
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,320
And so we're really excited

802
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,450
about the work we're doing
right now with Amazon,

803
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,040
with Nova Sonic 2, you
know, Amazon connect

804
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,690
and really kind of, taking
a look at call center

805
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,807
a different way.

806
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:23,010
You know, I want to kind
of talk a little bit

807
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,350
about the people side of that too, is,

808
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,960
you know, I think there
was a lot of, you know,

809
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,910
recent research saying that the pace

810
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,050
at which AI is gonna roll out

811
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,870
is really, only constrained by the people.

812
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,750
If people all know they're
gonna lose their job to AI,

813
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,057
it's gonna be really hard
to kind of, really do that.

814
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:42,666
And so, how do you kind of,
create an environment where,

815
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,060
you know, people can help
automate themselves, have a job,

816
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,040
and move on to the next part of automation

817
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,750
in a health system, and have,

818
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,910
play a substantial role into
that, get the retraining.

819
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,010
And so we're right now in the process

820
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,620
of really focused on the
culture aspect to this,

821
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,910
and the retraining aspect to this,

822
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,190
because there's a lot of,
as that turnover happens,

823
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,630
it's gonna happen rapidly.

824
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,040
We're gonna figure out, you know,

825
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,690
areas that we wanna focus on.

826
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,738
We wanna automate things,

827
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:08,040
but how do we kind of create
that workforce of the future

828
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,430
that has those skills
of, you know, curiosity,

829
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,530
that has the skills of
continuous learning,

830
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,460
that has the skills

831
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,350
of really being able to
help us automate that.

832
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,580
So I think that's kind of,

833
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,770
part and parcel to this journey of AI,

834
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,500
is really your organizational culture.

835
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,837
And I think the last thing, you
know, I just say on that is,

836
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:27,600
we're a big believer in
building it ourselves.

837
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,280
And so, I believe

838
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,050
that your competitive
advantage in healthcare

839
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,320
in any business, is gonna be
about your domain knowledge

840
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,500
that you have of your own
institution, how it functions,

841
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,087
how it works, and the data
and how clean that is,

842
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:43,860
and how that's gonna be acting on AI,

843
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,390
and how you can build and automate that,

844
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,340
internal to your own organization.

845
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,210
Now, I'm not saying you have to

846
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,470
out-innovate the marketplace.

847
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,180
There's no reason to not use partners,

848
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,370
but I'm a big believer in,

849
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,080
it's kind of like the old BPO model.

850
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,560
Like, when you think about
business process outsourcing,

851
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,730
you kind of lose a little touch

852
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,506
that you're really kind
of claiming to the world,

853
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:03,360
maybe that's not my core business,

854
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,410
maybe I don't really need to

855
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,720
do that piece and function my company.

856
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,130
So I think with AI, you gotta be

857
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,930
really thoughtful in your approach

858
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,760
about when you bring in a partner,

859
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,760
and that's gonna do all
the AI on your behalf,

860
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,900
is that something that you really,

861
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,690
you need a core competency
in your organization to do?

862
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,680
Is it a bridge strategy

863
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,000
that you're gonna build it in the future?

864
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,290
Is it something you're gonna evaluate

865
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,063
and kind of pilot and learn from?

866
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,490
Those are all the kind of conversations

867
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,350
we're having right now,
about how we can take it,

868
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,965
leverage partners to the
fullest extent for speed.

869
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,960
And I have several colleagues
in the audience today

870
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,000
that would tell us, you
know, we gotta go faster.

871
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,100
We gotta be able to enable the business

872
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,470
to kind of, think through
things and innovate

873
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,300
at a business level.

874
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,910
And that is sometimes
done through partners,

875
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,140
but we also gotta be able to,

876
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,250
where there's competitive advantage,

877
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,960
where we wanna drive distinction,

878
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,360
be able to build that
internally ourselves.

879
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,820
- Love it, Andy, I'm gonna turn to you

880
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,917
because I think you're innovating

881
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,740
at a breakneck speed here,

882
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,573
and I think one of the,

883
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:02,433
I think Mike mentioned
workforce of the future.

884
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,190
Tell us what your secret sauce is there,

885
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,190
and your partnership model just
internally, within Advocate.

886
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,400
- So you do need partners.

887
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,810
You know, if you're the person

888
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,333
that's leading digital
or AI transformation,

889
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,490
especially with the AI component,

890
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,710
you're either viewed as Santa
Claus or the Grim Reaper.

891
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,390
You're either bringing them great tools,

892
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,010
or you're there to take their jobs

893
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,480
and help get reduction.

894
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,150
And that's not a place
you wanna stand at alone.

895
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,080
And so I think,

896
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,870
relationships and partnerships
are really important.

897
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,456
Fortunately for us, and I know
many of the other panelists,

898
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,960
it takes the CEO taking a position to say,

899
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,570
AI will be the operating
model for the future,

900
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,490
or how we're gonna get to
transformation in healthcare.

901
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,250
So we do have to, we want
to be able to grow volume,

902
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,580
outcomes and profitability at a scale

903
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,220
where operating expense does
not go at the same level.

904
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,480
And if you look at healthcare today,

905
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,170
you normally grow major
acquisitions and activities,

906
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,280
margin stays the same,

907
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,800
and that's how you get to a
bottom, a different bottom line.

908
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,360
That's not gonna work in the future.

909
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,100
And if you look at,

910
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,370
I talked about the best
place to care strategy

911
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,546
with the clinicians,

912
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:12,720
I do have another partner that's
the chief clinical officer

913
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,520
who has nursing and physicians.

914
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,470
But I have another one,
which is Nakesha Lopez,

915
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,840
which is our chief people
and culture officer.

916
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,260
And she has a, it'll
be trademarked as well,

917
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,310
workforce of the future.

918
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,020
She's calling it, work forward.

919
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,696
And our AI factory will
laser focus on the areas

920
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:32,190
that have the biggest
opportunity for transformation.

921
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,780
Mike just spoke about the contact center,

922
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,850
that is clearly one of our
pods in this environment.

923
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,440
Revenue cycle is another,

924
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,220
and we will systematically
go through it role by role,

925
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,370
about what can an agent
first approach do to this,

926
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,080
and what is the new work
that they have to do,

927
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,583
and how do I get them there?

928
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,430
We're excited about that
in some of these areas.

929
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,560
Contact center and
revenue cycle, you know,

930
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,980
turnover rates are between 18 and 35%.

931
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,860
So it's not necessarily
about eliminating jobs,

932
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,930
if you just don't rehire through attrition

933
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,250
over the next three years,

934
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,960
the productivity benefit and
outcomes will be significant.

935
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,250
And so we're excited about that.

936
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,420
I would say we're,

937
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,080
as it relates to the
internal messaging on this,

938
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,157
and getting it right with our teammates,

939
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:18,210
it's gonna launch in Q1 of next year.

940
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,830
We have a lot of work to do that,

941
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,480
the places that clinicians
are leading the charge,

942
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,090
they know the shortages are so high,

943
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,390
that AI's just gonna help
eliminate the shortage.

944
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,128
The back office members
are a little bit, you know,

945
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,250
they're like, okay, what's
gonna happen to my role?

946
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,740
So I think you do have to enlist

947
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,170
the hearts and the minds
of the right leaders

948
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,170
on this journey, and the
right frontline teammates

949
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,430
to be a part of that charge.

950
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,100
So it's top down on the big uses cases,

951
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,770
but also citizen-led
development in certain areas,

952
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,670
as a bottom up, to galvanize
the interest for them.

953
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,750
And there's some overlap,

954
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,034
but really excited about
what that's gonna look like.

955
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:00,240
But you don't wanna be
leading this change alone,

956
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,170
that's for damn sure.

957
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,469
It's a lonely place to be.

958
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,848
- Right, right, so I'm gonna,

959
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:07,230
for those that don't read

960
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,690
Werner Vogel's, CTO of Amazon's yearly,

961
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,130
sort of, 2026 predictions,

962
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,829
highly, highly recommend that,

963
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:17,673
he, I'm gonna quote what
he posted last week,

964
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:21,060
"Instead of human in the loop,

965
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,297
it now should be, AI in the human loop."

966
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,510
And that's a fundamental
shift to what we've done

967
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,280
for the last 20, 30 years,

968
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,400
is build workflows and processes

969
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,117
around people and technology.

970
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:42,480
Well, let's, we should
take another look at that

971
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,250
and we will, and Andy,

972
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,090
I know you're chomping at the bit.

973
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,080
- Yeah, I was just gonna say,

974
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,008
we just launched seven use cases

975
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:51,690
in our contact center space,

976
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,523
which are really about

977
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,720
care management and care coordination,

978
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,903
and it's AI first,

979
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,430
with escalation and on
and off ramps to humans

980
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,390
that can handle it.

981
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,690
So you know, I don't ever
want another situation

982
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,560
where the first call or
the first text message

983
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,973
is on behalf of a skilled
nurse or a provider.

984
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,670
It ought to be these technologies,

985
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,680
and then the right
escalations and oversight

986
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,960
to make sure that, when
it hits a critical point,

987
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,130
you've got a human in the loop.

988
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,410
But, and I can remember
saying that, you know,

989
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,270
with the clinicians, oh,
it's human in the loop,

990
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,257
human in the loop, human in the loop.

991
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,670
And now I'm sitting here going,

992
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,280
I gotta come up with a different
bimodal strategy on this,

993
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,170
because that can't be
the way we move forward,

994
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,590
because we'll only get the
three to 5% productivity gains.

995
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,018
We won't get the transformation
that we're supposed to get.

996
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:43,020
- That's right, that's right,
Raj I'm gonna turn to you,

997
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,100
because you know, you have, you know,

998
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,870
we talk, you know, in the

999
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,218
consulting and the professional services

1000
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:52,470
and the, in whatever you want to call

1001
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,440
consulting and the forward
deployment engineer now, right?

1002
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,490
But it is, you talk
about, you embody a quote

1003
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,637
that our senior partner
said in an article.

1004
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:07,350
"You want progress, but not perfection."

1005
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,530
And I feel you've embodied
that over the last two years.

1006
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,680
Talk to us about what that
means to wealth sense,

1007
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,320
and part of, what was your
vision to actually do this?

1008
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,040
Like, incremental benefit
versus a large benefit,

1009
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,873
all at once.

1010
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:22,860
So, talk to us about your journey.

1011
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,568
- Yeah I mean, part of it is
just how I'm wired, right?

1012
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,336
I have a bias for action.

1013
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:35,336
I have very little patience
for analysis paralysis,

1014
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,680
'cause most of the time,

1015
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,940
in a majority of the input that
you need to make a decision

1016
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,070
is already in front of you.

1017
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,500
Are you gonna make that
decision or not, right?

1018
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,332
And then you have to be comfortable

1019
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:52,620
adapting as, you know,
things change, right?

1020
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,762
So that's always been my approach.

1021
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,090
And the other thing is, again,

1022
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,470
I didn't have the luxury,

1023
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,280
because of the financial
stress of the health system,

1024
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,860
and safety net and all that,

1025
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,860
to innovate and test and do
a lot of POC's and stuff.

1026
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,270
I wanted the ability to like,

1027
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,900
pick one or two as we
were just kicking off,

1028
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,580
and just absolutely hit home
runs and drive the value.

1029
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,080
Because in the very beginning,

1030
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,990
you need to build credibility
with everybody, right?

1031
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,540
So there's a lot of apprehension,

1032
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,060
like, everybody talked about it, about AI.

1033
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,340
I wanted to get past some of that,

1034
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,790
and demonstrate the value
realization there, right?

1035
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,735
So, that was fundamentally
how I approached it.

1036
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:43,266
And part of it was like, you know,

1037
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:47,817
to ultimately get the true unlocking of AI

1038
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,890
and the value realization,

1039
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,390
you need to do a complete
business process reimagination.

1040
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,840
If you are taking the same
crappy business processes

1041
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,140
that you have, and you're
looking to automate,

1042
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,820
yeah, you can find efficiencies,

1043
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,660
15% at this point here, 20 percent there.

1044
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,070
But you have to be able to step back

1045
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,903
and say like,

1046
00:43:08,903 --> 00:43:12,060
"How should this be
completely redesigned?"

1047
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,963
Like Andy and Mike are now
saying, AI first, right?

1048
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,980
But to do that you have to like,

1049
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,150
earn trust and credibility,
and build relationship

1050
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,570
where people are willing
to come to the table.

1051
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,470
But at the end of the day,

1052
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,290
that to me, is my biggest challenge now,

1053
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,370
because we've established
a really strong program,

1054
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,150
but there's still a
healthy fear in terms of,

1055
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,350
'cause you don't, you know,

1056
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,660
when you look at this
business process very clear,

1057
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,360
like, these steps should just go away,

1058
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,430
but there's a direct people impact

1059
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:50,100
that is tied to those steps, as well.

1060
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,500
And it's easy to say

1061
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,610
that we will train
everybody in AI and stuff.

1062
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:00,210
Some people are just not able to

1063
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,160
or willing to, right?

1064
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,740
So those are some of the
things that I would say,

1065
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,710
you know, to always keep
in the back of mind,

1066
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,900
that the change management aspect of it,

1067
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,350
this is why AI cannot
be a technology push.

1068
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,980
You need to have the chief
people officer, right,

1069
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,630
your chief operating officer,

1070
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,690
like, you need that team

1071
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,060
to help the organization like, you know,

1072
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,110
get where it needs to.

1073
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,403
- Right, right, Geoff, this is,

1074
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,040
so I know you and I have talked about

1075
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,600
what Raj exactly said, right?

1076
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,010
Don't agentify legacy dysfunction, right?

1077
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,210
How do you go into a complex organization,

1078
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,770
you know, whether it's, you know,

1079
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,690
regardless of size of health
system, it's still complex.

1080
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,119
How would you approach
this from a partnership?

1081
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,160
And how is AI impacting your people?

1082
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,710
I mean, I know it's from a
software engineering perspective,

1083
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,203
it's reshaping the entire industry, right?

1084
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,840
And it's reshaping consulting,

1085
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,470
it's reshaping all
software product as well.

1086
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,517
How do you approach it and, or,

1087
00:45:09,517 --> 00:45:11,003
how, how will you approach it?

1088
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:16,170
- So, a couple different levels.

1089
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,950
I have a personal model
that's not based off a movie,

1090
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,020
that, I just look for soft targets,

1091
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,370
where are the soft targets?

1092
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,830
You see them all around your organization,

1093
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,940
whether you're in healthcare,

1094
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,800
whatever your specific business is,

1095
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,770
you see the soft targets,
what is not working well?

1096
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,140
And most of the time you then find,

1097
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,901
who is the partner that
wants to solve this with me?

1098
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,820
Usually they're reaching out to you,

1099
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,030
but there is, I think Andy said
Grim Reaper or Santa Claus.

1100
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,160
There's a lot of magical
thinking about AI.

1101
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,170
I mean, there's a lot of hype,

1102
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,240
but the reality of, how
do we make this practical,

1103
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,490
as Raj said, is process engineering,

1104
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,783
process identification, change management.

1105
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:56,430
I think you've, I've heard
the word change management

1106
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,990
uttered a couple times.

1107
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,270
People have to be prepared for that.

1108
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,830
And so when you find those soft targets,

1109
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,247
then it's finding your partner and saying,

1110
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,970
"Can we create a solution together?"

1111
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,270
And we deployed a
solution with our HR team.

1112
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,550
It wasn't fancy, it wasn't sexy,

1113
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,050
but it was putting together

1114
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,450
and reducing some of the headcount,

1115
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,320
or not the headcount,

1116
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,640
but the amount of calls coming in,

1117
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,350
so we could create answers.

1118
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,030
The product needs to be trained better.

1119
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,070
And so how do we work
with that partner to say,

1120
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,930
how do we become better at this?

1121
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,030
What is their responsibility?

1122
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,680
And then, are they going to own it

1123
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,260
within the company, as well?

1124
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,600
I don't know how the other
gentlemen are seeing it,

1125
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,230
but sometimes AI or
technology is mine to own,

1126
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,930
and when it works, it's
theirs to take credit,

1127
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,390
and when it fails, it's ours to fix.

1128
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,950
And so I think that partnership again,

1129
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,740
is said over and over again,
is going to be very important,

1130
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,730
but it's making sure

1131
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,181
that you have the tools and the agents

1132
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:52,260
to rework that process.

1133
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,220
And if you have partners

1134
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,523
that don't have the vision
for process re-engineering,

1135
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,700
scrap it, scrap it, start over,

1136
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,470
find those soft targets
who wanna work with you

1137
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,470
to make that change.

1138
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,070
- No, no, you know,

1139
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,980
fail fast, learn from
it and rinse and repeat.

1140
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,090
- A hundred percent.

1141
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:12,150
And again, the willing
partners, the process,

1142
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,040
the technology go after, go quick.

1143
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,720
And I think that's probably the one thing

1144
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,890
that all of us on the stage,

1145
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,570
and probably you all in here as well,

1146
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,070
we opt towards action,

1147
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,440
and if others don't want to act,

1148
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,120
then they will be a barrier to that.

1149
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,430
And so you must find a way
to get through that barrier,

1150
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,730
so that you can have the adoption
of whatever technology is,

1151
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:33,799
whether it's boring, old, I don't know.

1152
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:34,800
- Yeah.

1153
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,250
- ERP or it is AI to transform the world.

1154
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,120
Am I gonna get canceled?

1155
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,984
I've just locked on

1156
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:40,817
ERP and payers, so.
- No, you're not.

1157
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,119
- You're not.
- So if I get canceled

1158
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,679
after this.
- You're not, Mike,

1159
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:44,512
I know you're chomping at the bit,

1160
00:47:44,512 --> 00:47:45,477
but you have lots of
thoughts here, so what's?

1161
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:48,690
- No, I agree, but I also
think there's, you know,

1162
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,420
I think the whole, you
know, tech governance is,

1163
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,580
moves too slow to manage
this tech right now.

1164
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,740
I just really do, I can agree with Raj.

1165
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,360
I think there's more citizen-led

1166
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,490
AI development in the future, I really do.

1167
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,403
- I hope so.
- I think.

1168
00:48:00,403 --> 00:48:01,236
- I hope so.

1169
00:48:01,236 --> 00:48:03,210
- I think it, I think, you know,

1170
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,740
it's kinda like, trying
to govern the internet.

1171
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,247
When we put it out there
we didn't say like,

1172
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:08,430
"Hey, you know, you can
only go to these websites

1173
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,263
to look at information."

1174
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:11,640
We let people, you know,
experiment, we let people go.

1175
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,280
And I think this is gonna be so ubiquitous

1176
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,210
in everything we do.

1177
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,680
We're gonna have to have, you know,

1178
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,275
enterprise class AI that's got guardrails

1179
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:21,480
and got, you know, everything
there to kind of be,

1180
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,420
you know, take those, the 80% use cases,

1181
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,760
but there's a lot of
around the edge, you know,

1182
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,470
type of stuff that we
just need to automate,

1183
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,180
and we need to give the
tools to the business

1184
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,293
and let them, you know,
go forward with it.

1185
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,630
You know, in a safe fashion.

1186
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,962
But I'm a big believer that, you know,

1187
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:39,000
sometimes this is, you've gotta prioritize

1188
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,680
where you put your resources in tech,

1189
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,900
but you've also gotta move fast.

1190
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,550
And I think that that speed piece

1191
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,050
is something we're grappling with.

1192
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,570
Like, how do you change
the IT tech operating model

1193
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,420
to really enable, you know,

1194
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,681
a faster pace of deployment?

1195
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,110
- Yeah.

1196
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,280
- I couldn't agree more.

1197
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,790
- Yeah, Andy, so I know we're
all running out of time,

1198
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,680
but final thoughts from your side.

1199
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,870
How do we, how are you looking at 2026,

1200
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:07,493
given that every month,
stuff changes every month,

1201
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:09,874
we're on, hopefully on the path to AGI,

1202
00:49:09,874 --> 00:49:14,874
and what is the first
quarter, what is 2026

1203
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,920
look for you in this area?

1204
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,510
- Yeah, so I think that if you,

1205
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,610
I'm gonna break it into
two or three categories.

1206
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,680
The first one is that, you know,

1207
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,980
we believe that every clinical caregiver

1208
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,130
that's touching a patient or a customer,

1209
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,890
should have augmented, assistive AI

1210
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,900
at their fingertips,

1211
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,993
over the entire ecosystem
of the work that they do.

1212
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,100
And we also believe in
citizen-led development

1213
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,570
on these type of activities.

1214
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,790
If I go back to the pandemic,

1215
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,790
when we had a common enemy and an urgency,

1216
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,060
we've moved more tech in 12 to 18 months

1217
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,950
than we did in our past 10 to 15 years.

1218
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,660
If it wasn't for the pandemic,

1219
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,730
virtual would not be commonplace.

1220
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,170
There used to be disbelief

1221
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:01,320
that virtual care was not a
replacement for in-person care.

1222
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,780
Bullshit, it is a replacement
for in-person care,

1223
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,360
or at least a first and
second and third choice.

1224
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,310
And so our data shows that today.

1225
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,280
So I think you'll see us
continue mass deployments

1226
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,960
in the clinical ecosystem.

1227
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,840
I think that the AI literacy, you know,

1228
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,670
the best way to raise AI literacy

1229
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,920
is have them using it and
playing with it every day.

1230
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,870
And so, but if you don't
make the investment

1231
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,760
in the platform and the data systems,

1232
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,280
you can't give them a safe way to do it.

1233
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,120
The other thing is that,

1234
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,740
if you don't give them a safe way to do it

1235
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,760
with those platforms,

1236
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,460
they will find a way around you to use it

1237
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,110
in all kinds of unsecure places.

1238
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:35,610
So your safest thing is

1239
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,970
to give them a citizen-led
development safe place to do it,

1240
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,380
to protect yourself.

1241
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,750
I think the third thing
is doing the hard work

1242
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,797
that we've never done well.

1243
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:45,510
And I thought Geoff was gonna talk about

1244
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,480
his first leader in the
performance improvement space

1245
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,220
that he worked with, some guy,

1246
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,350
and we worked together,

1247
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,350
and Geoff came from the
performance improvement side,

1248
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,320
that work of re-engineering
and not spreading,

1249
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,130
not spending your talent on three to 5%,

1250
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,910
and really focusing on
the hard re-engineering,

1251
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,620
is where we have to go.

1252
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,730
We believe that,

1253
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:12,300
we've got 29 million
inbound phone calls a year,

1254
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,120
15 to 20 million outbound a year.

1255
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,120
We believe that 65 to 70% of
that should go away on people,

1256
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,890
average panel size for
a primary care provider,

1257
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,360
where there are mass shortages

1258
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,860
in care and health inequities,

1259
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,430
2,500 panel size, what
if I can get it to five

1260
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,263
in the next two years?

1261
00:51:30,263 --> 00:51:31,710
What if I get it to 7,500?

1262
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,820
What if your health system

1263
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,480
could make primary care profitable
or a new version of that?

1264
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,021
Those are some of the things
that we're looking at.

1265
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:40,860
It's just not about efficiency innovation,

1266
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,290
it's about business model transformation.

1267
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,750
- I love that, so pretend like, it's COVID

1268
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,970
and move fast like it's COVID.

1269
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,730
I love that, Raj, final thoughts?

1270
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,983
- No I mean, I'll just echo this.

1271
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:58,140
Speed to market and speed to
value is everything, right?

1272
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,870
And you know, just,

1273
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,313
I also wanna hit what Mike said.

1274
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,173
You have to enable people to like,

1275
00:52:07,173 --> 00:52:09,540
come into this AI world

1276
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,000
and start participating, right?

1277
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,680
On one hand we say that,

1278
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,060
we want business to be
willing and adopt AI,

1279
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,440
but then we like tell them,

1280
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,870
don't do this, don't do that, right?

1281
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:22,920
These two messages

1282
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,200
don't, sort of jive.
- We're the, no, police.

1283
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,103
- Right?

1284
00:52:26,103 --> 00:52:26,936
- Yeah.
- So it doesn't jive.

1285
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,373
So, now, I would just echo what Mike said.

1286
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,480
- Geoff, final thoughts,
some predictions for 2026?

1287
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,360
Apart from the Lions winning it all.

1288
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,250
- Yeah, ah no, thank you.

1289
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,733
I think for 26, again, just
you've already heard it,

1290
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:44,190
it's going to be about
change, more change.

1291
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,020
We can't keep up, you can't keep up.

1292
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,330
Whatever you're working
on is gonna change.

1293
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:51,202
And so I think it's being flexible

1294
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:54,420
and clinging onto a quick life cycle,

1295
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,610
purchase what you know
you can use immediately

1296
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,960
for the next three years.

1297
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,270
Don't get sucked into tech debt.

1298
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,410
I think that's would be my advice.

1299
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,660
And then for us as a health system,

1300
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,960
we're now merging in our
two technology stacks.

1301
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,280
And so it's about how to

1302
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,640
take core competencies of
our deep data knowledge

1303
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,130
with some of that
citizen-led of Northwell.

1304
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,230
Bring those togetherm
and can we really start

1305
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,063
to bring that forward?

1306
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,310
And so I'm excited for what we're seeing.

1307
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:27,270
But again, it's, if you don't know it,

1308
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,490
you probably are getting
phone calls from a nurse,

1309
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,200
and that same nurse has to see you.

1310
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,700
That's not how we should
be using our staff.

1311
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,130
And so, as these gentlemen
here spoke about,

1312
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,380
it is about reducing that load

1313
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,620
and making care to our communities a joy

1314
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,550
for these caregivers.

1315
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,933
Not a pain in the backside.

1316
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,780
- Mike, final thoughts?

1317
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,700
Any predictions for next year?

1318
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,610
- You know, I know we're in
a tough time in healthcare,

1319
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,780
and I think this is the kind of,

1320
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,623
the year to make or break it.
- Yeah.

1321
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:54,960
- You know, you gotta
be deploying the tech

1322
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,690
and there's a lot to do in 26,

1323
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,620
because, you know,

1324
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,710
the regular changes
coming a couple years out,

1325
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,060
you know, this is the year.

1326
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,893
So I think there's gonna be

1327
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:05,683
a lot of progress made in
our industry, you know,

1328
00:54:05,683 --> 00:54:07,140
I look forward to, you know,

1329
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,200
hearing what all my colleagues do here,

1330
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
you know, the time is now.

1331
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,150
So I think I'd say, you know,

1332
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,719
this is a pivotal moment in healthcare

1333
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,861
and I, you know, I hope that

1334
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:22,410
the tools we have with
generative AI, you know, cloud,

1335
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,240
all the partnership, all the advanced tech

1336
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,070
we talked about here, are able to

1337
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,220
really put us back on top
of where we need to be.

1338
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,053
We have a goal

1339
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:34,050
to reduce administrative
burden by 50% by 2028,

1340
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,480
and that goes across the board
for all of our clinicians,

1341
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,249
about all of our, you
know, all of our staff.

1342
00:54:39,249 --> 00:54:42,030
And you know, that's a real goal.

1343
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,870
And we really want to

1344
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,370
bring the joy back to practicing medicine

1345
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,260
for our clinical staff.

1346
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,720
We want the patients to
be more highly engaged.

1347
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,950
We want to give 'em better, you know,

1348
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,560
information and better
content, more, you know,

1349
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,780
eyes on the patient, not on the screen.

1350
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,221
And so we, we really feel like,

1351
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:01,290
this is the moment of transformation.

1352
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,140
And so I am, you know,

1353
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,860
I feel like my whole career

1354
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,090
has kind of come down to,

1355
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,977
finally we're in a position
where we have the tools,

1356
00:55:07,977 --> 00:55:10,491
the technology to actually

1357
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:12,810
take the vast amount of
knowledge in healthcare

1358
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,830
and really put it to great use.

1359
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,663
- Yeah.

1360
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,440
- And you know, be in
service to the patients

1361
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,460
to make healthcare easier,

1362
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,900
which is really all of our missions.

1363
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,750
- Yeah, there was, just to echo that Mike,

1364
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,190
there was a recent VC case
study on, I think it is,

1365
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,597
it was Menlo Ventures when they said,

1366
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:31,890
"Healthcare is the number
one, maybe number two,

1367
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,170
but number one, sector industry

1368
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:38,040
where generative AI is being
used for transformation."

1369
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,350
Because we all feel that this is,

1370
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,120
traditional AI was good,

1371
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,420
but this is so tangible,
so action oriented,

1372
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,910
that this is our, I think 2026

1373
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:52,140
is gonna be a very
transformative, actionable year.

1374
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,352
We can make a real impact to
the health system, alright.

1375
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:55,185
But thank you again.

1376
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,210
Thank you to the panelists.

1377
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,043
- [RAJESH] Thank you.

1378
00:55:58,043 --> 00:55:58,876
- [ABBAS] Let's, join me
in a round of applause.

1379
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:01,854
(audience applauding)
