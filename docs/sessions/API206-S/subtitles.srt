1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,070
- Hello and welcome everybody,
thank you for coming.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,450
So yeah, I'm Chris Bingham.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,190
I'm the AWS Ambassador

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,640
and Country CTO for
Switzerland at Fujitsu.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,360
And at Fujitsu we're applying
AI to real business issues

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,280
that are beyond just code generation,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,080
which we've heard a lot about today

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,470
and this week at re:Invent,
with the aim of aiding skill

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,810
and accelerating skilled people such

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,030
as supply chain managers.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,750
So what challenges do
supply chain managers face?

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,140
Well, not being one myself,
I did the 2025 thing

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,220
and I asked an AI and
it told me all of this.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,130
The answer, lots and varying challenges,

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,820
but I feel they can be
summarized with three key words,

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,273
volatility, disruption and transformation.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,170
Anybody else experiencing those things in

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,850
their work these days?

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,693
It's a bit of a common theme, isn't it?

20
00:00:55,693 --> 00:01:00,360
So overall supply chain
management involves working

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,650
with a lot of rapidly
shifting data across many,

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,140
many dimensions and sources

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,130
from suppliers, from
customers, from customs

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,030
and regulators, from
manufacturing through to sales,

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,430
and every business unit in between.

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,220
And of course, this
kind of high complexity,

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,990
high dimensionality scenario
is exactly where AI excels.

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,650
Particularly, where AI works
with experienced professionals,

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,170
domain experts who can wield AI

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,535
to achieve positive business impacts.

31
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:37,770
And creating positive
impacts through data and AI

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,740
is at the core of Fujitsu's uvance

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,950
decision intelligence offerings.

34
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,370
A key tenant of uvance
decision intelligence is

35
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,190
to enable your teams through data

36
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:55,190
and AI by providing solutions
which act as companions

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,950
supporting you in your work
through the combination

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,483
of Fujitsu's technical expertise
and your domain expertise.

39
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,250
This approach delivers high
quality decisions at pace

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,860
with the aim of creating positive business

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,110
and social impact.

42
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,890
And in this spirit, our teams
applied their domain knowledge

43
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,773
to create a solution to help
supply chain management.

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,100
Our first generation solution was built

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,810
to aid supply chain managers
through automation and AI.

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,960
It leveraged AI agents
to intelligently help

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,790
with balancing inventory

48
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,530
and crucially with managing
adverse effects and disruptions.

49
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,340
For example, this screenshot
shows the supply chain effects

50
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,960
of an earthquake which
occurred in January, 2024.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,950
In this case, this real world
case, our customer was able

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,920
to quantify the impact

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,900
of this earthquake on the supply chains

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,173
and begin mitigation within two hours.

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,450
Their competitors by comparison
had to work around the clock

56
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,483
for three days to get to the same point,

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,393
which sounds wonderful.

58
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,150
However, this version

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,170
of our solution faced
some technical challenges.

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,183
In a nutshell, speed.

61
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,410
Agentice AI, like all other uses of AI,

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,593
is only effective when
it's attuned to reality.

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,250
And here our first generation
approach was limited.

64
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,940
Lacking a single cohesive platform

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,950
for managing agent life cycles,

66
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,910
the very pieced together
architecture which we had

67
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,130
hindered our ability to adapt agents

68
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,023
to changing circumstances.

69
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,876
Unchecked this would lead to agent drift,

70
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:52,800
agents moving away from the
business context over time,

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,540
resulting in the relevance

72
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,470
and quality of their responses degrading.

73
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,320
Leading to negative impact
on the business outcomes our

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,643
customers could achieve.

75
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,420
So how did we build a
solution which could rise

76
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,970
to this challenge of agent drift?

77
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,943
Well, we're at re:Invent, so
naturally enough with AWS,

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,660
specifically Bedrock AgentCore provides

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,640
that single coherent platform

80
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,553
for managing our agent's life cycles.

81
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,570
AgentCore replaced the mishmash
of components at the heart

82
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,783
of our AI agents with a
single joined up platform.

83
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,340
This simplified architecture
diagram illustrates

84
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,723
how AgentCore integrates
into our uvance SCM solution.

85
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,210
Agent Core runtime provides,
naturally enough, the runtime

86
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,703
environment for all of our AI agents.

87
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:52,320
AgentCore Gateway handles
the integration of all

88
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,270
of the supply chain data sources

89
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,330
and tools which those agents need.

90
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,315
Whilst AgentCore identity

91
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:03,960
manages centralized access control for all

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,103
of those agents against all of
those tools and data sources.

93
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,440
And last but by no means
least, AgentCore Observability

94
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,350
provides deep insights into the how

95
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,250
and the why of AI agent performance.

96
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,510
And that final piece,

97
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,930
AgentCore Observability is the linchpin to

98
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,090
how we addressed the
challenge of agent drift

99
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,743
by creating yet another AI.

100
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,140
Yes, more AI on top of AI.

101
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,290
The Guardian Agents, as we
call it, the Guardian Agent,

102
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,770
is tasked with guarding against drift.

103
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,580
It works to identify cases

104
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,040
where our SCM agents' responses
have started to degrade

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,510
and then acts to correct

106
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,510
that drift based on both
agent core observability data

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,583
and supply chain manager's feedback.

108
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:02,726
The uvance SCM UX includes opportunities

109
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,260
for supply chain managers

110
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,320
to provide qualitative
feedback on the business

111
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,660
performance of the agents.

112
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,170
This enables uvance SCM
to capture any shifts in

113
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,290
that business performance independently

114
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,363
of any technology metrics.

115
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,890
The guardian agent can then combine

116
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,080
that business performance feedback

117
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,164
with observability data from AgentCore,

118
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:30,870
most especially the chain

119
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,369
of thought data like the
example which we see here,

120
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:37,050
to work out where in that chain

121
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,843
of thought the agent has started to drift.

122
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:47,970
And in doing so, formulate
modifications to the prompts used

123
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,625
for that agent.

124
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:54,625
These prompt updates are then
stored in a central DynamoDB

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,230
prompts table and utilized for next time

126
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,973
that drifting agent is called.

127
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,530
This means for automated analysis of

128
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,610
and reaction to agent drift is triggered

129
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,113
by human feedback.

130
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,730
By supply chain managers
identifying insufficient

131
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,730
business context fit implicitly
through their feedback,

132
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,220
creating a human-centric approach

133
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,860
to evolving the AI
agents, which is supposed

134
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,843
to help the humans.

135
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,470
So with that, I'm now gonna
show you a quick video

136
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,627
demonstration of uvance SCM.

137
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,645
And hopefully we'll get the audio.

138
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,711
- [Narrator] I'd like to show
you a real time demonstration

139
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,813
(indistinct).

140
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,896
When the project started,
(indistinct) had 1,000 people

141
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:50,479
working in the global (indistinct).

142
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,325
Their resources were aged
and many veteran workers

143
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:56,276
were starting to retire in three years.

144
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,007
Reducing the required resources

145
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:00,794
was one of their most pressing challenges.

146
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:05,063
Their most labor intensive
task was (indistinct).

147
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:09,174
They had about 50 to 100 workers
at each plant (indistinct).

148
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:11,080
Because their systems were silent,

149
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,814
they had to manually
calculate the inventory

150
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:17,678
to identify excess and
(indistinct) using exceptions.

151
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,936
One person could cover
up to just 10 minutes,

152
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:24,782
so they needed 1,000
people to (indistinct).

153
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,474
So we've made this dashboard.

154
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:29,909
Now all they have to do is
(indistinct) notifications

155
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,742
when the system (indistinct).

156
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:41,027
This dashboard is now used
by company top management

157
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:44,277
and also (indistinct).

158
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:50,919
Here in this view you can
see the (indistinct) trend

159
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,757
(indistinct), factoring in
it's peculiar production

160
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:55,840
sales client.

161
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:04,605
I haven't seen many other
company that can do the same.

162
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,471
The yellow dot indicates the
time (indistinct) origin.

163
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,058
The red dot indicates (indistinct).

164
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,378
And the purple path shows the opportunity

165
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:15,211
to be lost in a (indistinct).

166
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:21,196
The blue line shows the optimal inventory

167
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:24,779
according to (indistinct).

168
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:32,524
In just two months the
AI generated (indistinct)

169
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,286
of less than 10%.

170
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:38,369
(narrator drowned out by static)

171
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,697
So by just following this blue line,

172
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,274
the customer can not only
reduce the cost associated with

173
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:03,691
(indistinct), but also
increase the revenue

174
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:07,524
while holding the loss
of sales opportunities.

175
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:12,780
The value generated so far is
significant, as you can see,

176
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,086
but if we utilize AI agents on top of it,

177
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,325
we can aim to have the necessary resources

178
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,325
again (indistinct).

179
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:28,870
(narrator drowned out by static)

180
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:49,673
As this view is just for
demonstration, (indistinct).

181
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:02,252
(narrator drowned out by static)

182
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:18,654
So now both agents are
processing the costs.

183
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:22,737
(narrator drowned out by static)

184
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:30,473
This job description (indistinct).

185
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:42,660
(narrator drowned out by static)

186
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,803
(narrator drowned out by static)

187
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,622
The AI agents, the (indistinct).

188
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:37,583
This (indistinct) the
concept of Fujitsu uvance,

189
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:42,583
which is to (indistinct)
business model (indistinct).

190
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:47,245
(narrator drowned out by static)

191
00:12:56,592 --> 00:13:00,675
(narrator drowned out by static)

192
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:25,074
Most companies can never
recalculate the (indistinct),

193
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:30,074
such as which suppliers are
important to (indistinct).

194
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:34,774
(narrator drowned out by static)

195
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:42,186
Is extremely difficult
without (indistinct).

196
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:53,740
(narrator drowned out by static)

197
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:03,401
This particular estimate is
able to identify (indistinct).

198
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:20,153
(narrator drowned out by indistinct)

199
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,307
- Okay, so to summarize,

200
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,490
our customers have seen meaningful boosts

201
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,930
to their SCM team's efficiency
from deploying uvance SCM,

202
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,020
leading to significantly
more rapid responses

203
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,033
to incidents within their supply chain.

204
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,620
And thanks to Bedrock
AgentCore's capabilities,

205
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,870
we've been able to
accelerate the integration

206
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,060
of new data sources such

207
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,640
as may come when you have a new supplier

208
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,983
by roughly an order of magnitude.

209
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,130
And these benefits together
improve your resilience,

210
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,303
both against everyday issues
