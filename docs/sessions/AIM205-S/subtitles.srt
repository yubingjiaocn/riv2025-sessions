1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,150
- [Host] Let's get started
with our first topic.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,290
Very interested if folks
aren't familiar with Ninja One,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,850
very cool software, can
help with IT operations

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,260
for your organization.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm excited for our next
speaker, Jeff Hunter,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,680
talking a little bit
about how to get it right

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
as it pertains to leveraging AI

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,220
and AI in the context of
operations in a scalable format.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,233
So without further ado, Jeff.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,250
- Thank you very much.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,420
Hello everyone. My name is Jeff Hunter.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,450
I'm the field CTO at a
company called Ninja One.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,630
I'm always curious who has heard of us.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,210
So just a quick show of hands,
who has heard of Ninja One,

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,070
maybe knows what we do?

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,653
Bonus points if you're
an actual user. Okay.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,730
Ninja One makes all
the tools that you need

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,123
to manage devices, IT teams
need to manage devices.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,410
And so this could be to patch
your devices, this could be

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,900
to alert whenever there's
some sort of issue.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,880
This could be to patch software,

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,990
and it can be to remotely
access devices via screen share

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,290
so you can help solve
problems in real time.

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,620
And we do that across Windows,
across Mac OS, across Linux,

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,253
across iOS, iPad OS, and Android devices.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,870
And having a platform to
manage all of these devices

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,680
is really important because
businesses run on endpoints

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,253
more now than they ever have
at any point in modern history.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,930
Now, we're all used to an
endpoint that could be a typical

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,170
laptop or a server, but they could also be

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,060
manufacturing equipment in factories.

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,680
They could be ticket kiosks,

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,180
they could be the digital billboards

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,800
that you see on the side of the road,

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,360
and in my own personal experience,

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
they are the movie theater projectors

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,473
that we see movies on
when we go to the cinema.

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,890
And on average we're touching about four

39
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,320
or more of these devices
every day just as a part

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,123
of our regular work lives.

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,570
And these devices all need to be secured

42
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,820
and they all need to be
supported over the course

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,560
of that device's lifecycle.

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,570
Now, to compound this issue,

45
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,460
the last five years have been the biggest,

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,090
most seismic sea change
in the IT industry ever.

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,310
Overnight organizations had to accommodate

48
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,880
to people working remotely,
not working in an office,

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,840
being all over different
geographic locations.

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,610
And it has been a slow journey

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,620
to put the toothpaste back in the tube

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,880
on that particular front.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,710
We still see a ton of hybrid

54
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,470
and remote work persisting
even more than five years

55
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,133
after it first really
begins in earnest in 2020.

56
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,970
And as always seems to
happen, this means IT teams

57
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,313
have to do more with less.

58
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,790
So more users to support, and
those users are also spread

59
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,680
apart geographically in a way that they

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
have not traditionally been.

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,360
And there are more
devices to cover as well

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,590
as those devices being of
more varying types of devices,

63
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,060
not kind of the traditional laptop

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,110
and server that we're very familiar with.

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,220
And this is all happening in
an era with a ton of merger

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,100
and acquisition activity,
shifting compliances,

67
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,540
different auditing standards,

68
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,333
and those all need to be
adhered to and accounted for.

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,940
In my experience, it seems like IT teams

70
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,270
almost have to massively
overproduce in order

71
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,520
to meet whatever their goals happen to be.

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,100
I would compare it to trying
to roast a marshmallow

73
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,310
over the campfire except you're
50 feet above the campfire.

74
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,920
You have to produce an
enormous amount of energy

75
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,283
just to get a little bit of a
heat to go to the right spot.

76
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,830
Now the solution for inefficiency
is being more efficient.

77
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,570
Groundbreaking, I know.

78
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,790
But really what we want to do is bring

79
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,950
that marshmallow a little
closer to the fire.

80
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,710
I promise I'll abandon that metaphor now.

81
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,220
But really we want to
take our more easy issues

82
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,080
and we want to automate them entirely.

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,930
We want to take our more
difficult, time consuming

84
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,540
and multi-step trouble shooting processes

85
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,640
and we want to streamline them.

86
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,670
We want to minimize the
need for human involvement

87
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,113
as much as possible.

88
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,520
And so now we introduce
AI into the equation.

89
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,890
I have had conversations with thousands

90
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,860
of IT teams over the past five years

91
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,490
and there are certain themes,
you know, common needs,

92
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,640
common questions that
start to emerge as a part

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,680
of those many conversations.

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,110
And one of the questions I
think I've heard more than any

95
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,410
other is, "What are you doing with AI?"

96
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,600
Now, fundamentally what
that question is asking

97
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,050
is, "How are you taking this
new and exciting technology,

98
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,960
what I view as fundamentally a new tool,

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
and how are you applying that

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,457
to the product's specific area of focus?"

101
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,930
Now, in the early days of AI
bursting into the mainstream,

102
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,290
my question was, "What
would you feel comfortable

103
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,050
putting in the hands of an AI?"

104
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,550
Because there's a ton of potential

105
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,880
for applying AI based systems

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,940
and methodologies into
endpoint management.

107
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,080
Ninja One's very first foray
into an AI feature was scraping

108
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,840
public data from the internet
on the sentiment about

109
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,490
different Windows patches.

110
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,890
Whenever somebody has a big
uptick in complaints about

111
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,410
a particular Windows
KB, that's a sign that

112
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,240
that patch is causing problems.

113
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,460
And so what we do is we
summarize all of that data

114
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,550
in a brief description right in the menu

115
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,530
where you actually approve those patches

116
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,440
so you have a quick and
easy way to be able to tell,

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,930
is this patch going to cause more problems

118
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,330
than it's actually able to solve?

119
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,700
This is a great application of AI.

120
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,790
We all know it's great at
taking a massive amount of data,

121
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,823
condensing it into an
easy to digest snippet.

122
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,570
But there's also the possibility

123
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,840
of AI taking more direct action.

124
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,850
Now that's the ambition, that's the dream,

125
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,280
that AI is going to be
able to perform autonomous

126
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,760
endpoint management
where you're able to have

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,710
the first touch responding
to an issue come from the AI

128
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,390
or from the system that's been set up,

129
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,450
and the first touch is not
necessarily a human being

130
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,103
who has to be directly involved.

131
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,430
Now again, that's the the
ambition, that's the dream,

132
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,340
but AI is of course a
brand new technology,

133
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,890
and with any new
technology, quite honestly,

134
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,670
any technology period,
there is a lot of risk.

135
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,740
It's just that as that technology evolves,

136
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,593
we tend to view the risk as
more of a known quantity.

137
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,460
Obviously an AI is only as good

138
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,740
as the documentation that it's trained on.

139
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,930
And if that documentation is wrong,

140
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,780
if the information it's
trained on is out of date,

141
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,210
if the data set is incomplete,

142
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,940
the AI is going to draw
the wrong conclusions,

143
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,970
and then the human being
who is using that AI

144
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,490
is going to amplify
those wrong conclusions

145
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,173
and spread misinformation.

146
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,460
In my experience, correcting that type

147
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,010
of misinformation is really difficult.

148
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,320
People latch onto their first impression,

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,530
so what they hear first it sets
in their minds like concrete

150
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,130
and it can be very, very
difficult to chisel it out.

151
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,530
Now this type of risk, if we apply that

152
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,540
to an endpoint management platform,

153
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,730
I think we're magnifying the potential

154
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,420
for undesired outcomes in
a pretty substantial way.

155
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,080
At a core level, this is a
marriage of a very powerful tool,

156
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,380
which an endpoint management
platform has to be by design,

157
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,590
and the marriage of an AI
that gives you the ability

158
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,230
to make decisions very quickly.

159
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,720
I would say we probably
all agree in this room,

160
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,990
it's a bad idea to make
bad decisions quickly.

161
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,083
That's the last thing that you want to do.

162
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,230
For example, there are other
endpoint management tools

163
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,460
that give you the capability

164
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,370
to actually generate
code, generate scripts

165
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,290
inside of the platform.

166
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,000
This can be really convenient,

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,180
but think about deploying
a script generated by an AI

168
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,600
to all of your devices, and the
AI decides that the shortest

169
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,570
distance between A and B
when it comes to freeing up

170
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,060
additional disc space
is just to delete stuff,

171
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,580
just to run the format
system drive command.

172
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,670
It's about the the last thing
we would want to have happen.

173
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,970
And so in using any AI
tool, we have to ask ourself

174
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,283
not just one question, but many questions.

175
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,530
For example, is there a
repeatable process in place

176
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,350
to make sure that we're able
to update the information

177
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,620
that the AI is making decisions
on on a regular basis?

178
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,930
Going to my earlier example, the Ninja One

179
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,090
patch intelligence AI feature.

180
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,550
Obviously when we're
scraping for data on patches,

181
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,530
that's going to fluctuate over time.

182
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,660
And so we need to be able
to take that into account

183
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,370
that the sentiment might not be negative

184
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,740
when the patch is first
released, but as more data

185
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,290
comes into the system, we are more aware

186
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,080
that the patch could be bad.

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
And we also need to plan for
what is the worst case scenario

188
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,880
that could arise from misuse
or a bad implementation of AI.

189
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,370
And as a part of that planning,
we have to ask ourselves

190
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,620
what guardrails are in
place to ensure that

191
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,300
that does not happen?

192
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,830
And if something does happen

193
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,280
that is undesired, how
is that decision making

194
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,393
process tracked?

195
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,530
How can we track and audit
to know how we arrived

196
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,540
at that particular decision

197
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,250
so that adjustments can be made

198
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,413
to prevent that in the future?

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,510
I wanna talk just briefly
about a few categorizations

200
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,240
of AI use in terms of how that's applied

201
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,710
to endpoint management.

202
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm sure we're all very
familiar with generative AI.

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Everyone here has used
Co-pilot, Gemini ChatGPT

204
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,060
at one point or another.

205
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,650
We've all asked it to do something.

206
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,900
We've all asked it to, you know,

207
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,450
answer a question of some sort.

208
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,390
Now flipping the switch,
we have agentic AI.

209
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,680
So this is then taking
action, performing actions,

210
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,970
performing a routine task,

211
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,700
ideally without the
involvement of a human being.

212
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,820
For example, maybe a ticket
comes into a help desk

213
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,390
and the ticket is recognized
as a common problem

214
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,340
with a known solution.

215
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,520
If we automatically apply
that solution to the problem,

216
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,770
to the ticket as a first step

217
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,250
before we actually escalate
to a human technician,

218
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,770
that is an a great way to streamline

219
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,500
and save time as a part
of the help desk process.

220
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,830
However, the danger becomes
a lack of adequate guardrails

221
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,380
around the action that you're taking.

222
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,350
In my example, I mentioned
applying a known solution

223
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,170
to a problem, and I say a known solution

224
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,310
because the danger of an ad
hoc generated on the spot

225
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,220
AI based solution is pretty great.

226
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,070
When you do that, you could be
exacerbating the problem more

227
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,900
than you're actually solving it.

228
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,460
I don't know if anybody's ever tried

229
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,010
to ask an LLM the same
question multiple times.

230
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,650
You often sometimes get five similar

231
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,270
answers, maybe a little similar.

232
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,190
You might get five answers
that are really different,

233
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,970
but it's pretty rare to get
the exact same identical answer

234
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,100
every single time you ask that question.

235
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,733
I don't think anybody's getting
five out of five on that.

236
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,130
And that's of course because
that answer is being, you know,

237
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,170
generated in real time.

238
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,123
And then on the predictive AI front,

239
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,020
this is obviously taking a
massive amount of data in

240
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,020
and then giving us insight
into what the future health

241
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,340
of the device looks like

242
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,073
and helping us prevent future
problems from occurring.

243
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,930
And so in action we see this
in terms of taking a ticket,

244
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,120
summarizing the ticket
that we are seeing there

245
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,030
and then potentially even
producing a potential answer

246
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,113
to that ticket.

247
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,860
In Ninja One , we see this
with our AI assistant,

248
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,040
it's called Katana 'cause we
do everything ninja themed.

249
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
And so that is an AI
assistant that we have

250
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
that's in a beta right now.

251
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,690
We also see it in the form
of that patch intelligence

252
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,630
AI feature that I mentioned earlier.

253
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,360
This is surfacing data about patches

254
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,700
when there's problems so
that you know about it.

255
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,220
But then we take it a step
further in terms of more

256
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,220
of an agentic AI approach to
where we're actually taking

257
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,080
those patches that have negative sentiment

258
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,390
and we're removing them
from the deployment queue.

259
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,570
So they're actually not going
to even deploy those patches.

260
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,760
It's going to reserve
it so that a human being

261
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,190
can look at it and decide if
this is actually applicable

262
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,543
to my devices or not.

263
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,410
And then of course, we can
predict what is going to happen

264
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,350
to devices in the future based
off of historical trends.

265
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,990
And so we have, we're
working towards a world

266
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,350
where we can track historical
data for CPU, for RAM,

267
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,140
measure the digital user's
experience on the endpoint,

268
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,640
and then give a stoplight system,

269
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,100
so green, everything is good,

270
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,200
yellow, maybe everything is
not so good on the device.

271
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,240
And then red, the digital user experience

272
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,130
is severely degraded.

273
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,040
That gives us insight into
how all of our end users

274
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,283
are being impacted by the
performance of their devices.

275
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,440
Now there is certainly
a narrative around AI

276
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,210
that I've heard a lot of, which is

277
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,373
that it is about replacing people.

278
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,430
Of course there's always
the extent to which

279
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,710
that's going to be true in certain jobs

280
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,330
and in certain industries.

281
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,150
But I would also say
that a true replacement

282
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,180
of a sizable chunk of
the workforce is against

283
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,290
historical trends.

284
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,900
The industrial revolution
was a long time ago.

285
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,420
There's been a lot of
inventions since the cotton gin

286
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,100
and we all still have jobs, you know,

287
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,363
we're just not farmers.

288
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,840
The invention of the assembly line,

289
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,060
that may have looked at the
time like that was going to be

290
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,370
a process that eliminated
the need for people

291
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,680
to be involved in things
like manufacturing

292
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
cars and different goods.

293
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,363
I think we now know that that
is not necessarily the case.

294
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,340
So at Ninja One, we definitely recognize

295
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,370
the tremendous power of AI based tools,

296
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,710
but we also strongly
believe that the value

297
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,030
of those tools comes from
being tied to the human beings

298
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,000
who are actually going to be using them.

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,280
Because if we look at the
different categorizations of AI

300
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,010
that we've discussed, what we
end up with is the potential

301
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,370
for a really powerful automation engine.

302
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,980
Again, where that first
touch is not going to be

303
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,740
a human being being involved,
it's going to be trying

304
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,190
all the attempted solutions,
the possible solutions

305
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,610
that we view as safe and
seeing if that fixes the issue

306
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,820
before we then elevate to a human being.

307
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,980
And the goal is to help
scale with business growth.

308
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,830
The goal is to improve the
device footprint, the number

309
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,593
of devices that a technician
can effectively manage.

310
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,790
But human beings are
fundamentally an intrinsic part

311
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,430
of endpoint management, even as automation

312
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,120
and AI might change the
day-to-day duties for those

313
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,220
who are working on the help desk.

314
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,700
And so in this context, we
need AI to be a reliable tool.

315
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,430
When somebody picks up that
tool, we need it to work.

316
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,530
Not every AI is created equal

317
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,140
and not every AI is
going to be equally adept

318
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,780
at your real world workflows.

319
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,820
If you give somebody a fillips
head screwdriver when they

320
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,740
need a flat head, you're pretty close,

321
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,290
but it's still not quite right.

322
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,830
And in the same light, using
a generic LLM is not likely

323
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,910
to give you the good experience
that you are going to get

324
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,547
from something that's purpose
built for the specific

325
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:06,660
area of focus that we're
working in in that given moment.

326
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,240
Quite honestly, people don't use tools

327
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,430
that they don't trust,
and in the very least,

328
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,100
they tend not to use
those tools very well.

329
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,230
And so it's important
to know how did an AI

330
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,200
come to a particular decision or outcome.

331
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,380
The air handling of an
AI, its auditability,

332
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,670
its trackability.

333
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,390
I view that as just as important
as the overall capability

334
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,700
of what an AI is able to accomplish.

335
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,500
Without that risk mitigation

336
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,540
and without that transparency,

337
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,820
there is not going to be
any trust between the human

338
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,310
who's using that tool and the tool.

339
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,500
At the end of the day,
a human being is always

340
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,110
going to be the one who's
on the hook for a decision

341
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,110
that is made by some
sort of AI based tool.

342
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,980
The heart of AI success,
long-term AI success.

343
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,930
I think that's built at the intersection

344
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,660
of this new emerging technology

345
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,630
and the human beings who
are going to be using it.

346
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,660
A key part of adoption of any
new technology is the humans

347
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,500
who use it.

348
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,750
If you give me a saw,
if you give my dad a saw

349
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,360
and you ask us to build a table,
his is going to be better.

350
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,003
He is better at that type of tool making.

351
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,480
It's always important to
remember there's a human being

352
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,580
at the other end of software.

353
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,470
And so consistent refresher training,

354
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,050
as this new technology
continues to develop,

355
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,990
this is paramount for critical ongoing,

356
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,823
it's critical to ongoing success.

357
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,330
And so as AI becomes more
integrated into IT workflows,

358
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,220
into endpoint management workflows,

359
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,850
organizations have to be
proactive in preparing the people

360
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,850
who are going to be using those
tools to not only use them

361
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,370
effectively, but to oversee them

362
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,530
and manage those tools effectively.

363
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,020
There is a human layer
that is necessary there

364
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,970
to understand, to interpret,

365
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,000
and to question AI driven outputs

366
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,340
so that we can use these
systems not just efficiently,

367
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,753
but also safely.

368
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,340
I think we envision a world
where endpoint management

369
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,863
becomes less in terms of human skillset.

370
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,740
You know, to use another
metaphor, it's not

371
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,840
so much about playing the
individual instruments

372
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,300
of the orchestra, it's about
conducting the entirety

373
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,490
of the orchestra at large.

374
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,370
And so IT staff need to be
trained to understand where

375
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,200
and how AI is being applied.

376
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,990
They need to understand
how to interpret AI outputs

377
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,310
as well as question them.

378
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,253
I would argue that the time
to question them is always,

379
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,940
because blind trust in
AI decisions does lead

380
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,030
to significant risk, much in the same way

381
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,820
that web designers use
dark patterns to influence

382
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,290
where our eyes are drawn

383
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,060
and where we're most likely to click.

384
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,790
In the same way that
early versions of iOS,

385
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,800
maybe before it was actually called iOS,

386
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,210
had sort of a textured look to it,

387
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,850
encouraging you to kind of
interact with the screen.

388
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,180
A lot of the times LLMs give
you overwhelmingly positive

389
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,180
responses to anodyne milk
toast queries and suggestions,

390
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,030
and so questioning, and
that's all done of course to,

391
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,880
you know, create this positive
feeling in the actual user

392
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,740
so that they come back and
they want to use it more,

393
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,720
which is not necessarily
the goal that you might

394
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
want to have when managing endpoints

395
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,803
and trying to improve business efficiency.

396
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,720
And so given the quickly
evolving AI landscape,

397
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,060
that continuous skill
development is critical.

398
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,150
Ongoing education, best practice
groups, regular meetings

399
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,100
for cross-functional knowledge sharing.

400
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,980
I think having maybe a
weekly or a monthly meeting

401
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,710
where a portion of that
is what is the best thing,

402
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,260
best suggestion that you had
from an interaction with AI,

403
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,450
and then what is the
worst thing that happened,

404
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,830
the worst thing that an AI suggested

405
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,390
to you this week or this month.

406
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,030
And that helps level set every,

407
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,840
that helps level set amongst the team.

408
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,640
Now in conclusion,

409
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,730
integrating new technology
is really difficult.

410
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,910
AI is new, it's exciting,
it's having a momentous impact

411
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,700
on how all of us work, but
it's also having an impact

412
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,790
on how our individual devices are managed.

413
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,340
That's important to remember
that tangible long-term

414
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,430
benefits resulting from the
integration of any technology

415
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,160
are going to come from
come down to how we align

416
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,603
human expertise.

417
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,720
Sorry, I don't know why this is,

418
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,950
I'm waving this around too much.

419
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,750
I think it's a little too sensitive.

420
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,080
So training should always
emphasize the importance

421
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,600
of a human being in the loop model,

422
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,100
sorry, where AI is
augmenting human knowledge

423
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,223
and judgment, not substituting
it and not replacing it.

424
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,210
And so this is where Ninja One is headed.

425
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,580
Autonomous endpoint
management, lessening the need

426
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,040
for human involvement for the most common

427
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,010
and the most annoying tasks,
freeing up those resources

428
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,920
so you can work and
think more strategically,

429
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,170
taking a less experienced
technician, allowing them

430
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,000
to operate at a higher level

431
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,160
and putting up those guardrails to prevent

432
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,190
dangerous solutions, dangerous decisions

433
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,170
from being implemented through the power

434
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,850
of endpoint management.

435
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,980
Thank you everyone for being here.

436
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,690
If you wanna chat a little
bit more about this,

437
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,110
come visit us at Booth
1216, right over there.

438
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,190
My name is Jeff Hunter

439
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,690
