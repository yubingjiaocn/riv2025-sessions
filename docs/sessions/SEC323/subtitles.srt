1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,010
- All right, welcome, everybody,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,190
to AWS detection and response innovations

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,930
that drive security outcomes.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,400
My name is Marshall Jones,
I'm a security SA at AWS.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,370
Day to day, I focus on our
detection and response services

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,020
that we'll talk about doing go-to market,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,620
helping customers operationalize
and scale these services,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,800
as well as get great
feedback from our customers

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
to drive kind of service
innovation going forward.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,900
So let Ryan introduce himself.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,195
- Sure, yeah.

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm Ryan Holland and I lead
the GuardDuty service team.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,571
- All right, so this is
a talk that has happened

14
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,600
at re:Inforce and re:Invent in the past,

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
where we go over all the new launches

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,960
and innovations in our
detection and response services.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,230
So if you're returning
to this talk, welcome.

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,213
If you are new, also welcome.

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,900
What we're gonna cover
in this conversation

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,010
is an overview of our detection
and response portfolio.

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,300
What are these native services?

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,340
How do customers normally use them?

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,040
Or we're gonna go through a
number of different demos.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,970
We're gonna talk about our
new features and capabilities.

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,790
We will also try and save
some time at the end.

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,400
If folks have questions or
want to connect afterwards,

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,443
we can do that as well, too.

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,390
So we're gonna get started
with kind of the problem space

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,410
that we see quite often.

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,550
Like I said, day to day,

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,960
talk to a lot of different customers

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,610
about the different security challenges

33
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,400
that they're trying to overcome
at their organizations.

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,500
And these ultimately get lumped

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,750
into a few different things.

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,873
Mainly, a lot of fragmented visibility.

37
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:41,910
Good security response, security
operations is usually built

38
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,810
on somewhat of a data
problem, unfortunately.

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,660
For some of the security
practitioners out there.

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,600
This is having visibility,
having the access to the data

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,400
that you need to have visibility

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,410
into what's going on in your environment,

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,830
what might be a risk,
what might be just a,

44
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,860
you know, an benign vulnerability
or something like that.

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,280
And really, understanding what
actually you have out there,

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,260
so you know what to make decisions on,

47
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,693
what to go respond to,
what to go remediate.

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,720
Some of these different
information that we get over time

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,890
has limited context across
the whole environment.

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,410
So kind of leading into our
different third challenge

51
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,860
as well too is being
disconnected security signal.

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,500
So either the signal
doesn't have much context

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
and we really need more
information to truly understand

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,870
what a different security
signal is telling us.

55
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
And then also not having
specific signals together.

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,820
So there's a lot of jumping
between different tooling

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,280
and a lot of, you know,
putting different pieces

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,200
of the puzzle that don't
really fit together to try

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,353
and understand of what
is in an overall picture.

60
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,150
And then ultimately, what that
causes is a delayed response.

61
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,010
Security is obviously one of those things

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,720
that folks just want to work,

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,610
so they can focus on their business.

64
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,850
And when there's delayed
response, delayed remediation,

65
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,490
that is, you know, obviously,
something that is a challenge

66
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,860
for security teams as
well as business owners,

67
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,023
and something nobody really wants, right?

68
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,220
So ultimately, what are
the things that we want

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,100
to accomplish based on these challenges

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,600
and based on like the business outcomes

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
that we want to drive with
these native detection

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,430
and response services.

73
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,160
So first, protecting your workloads

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,330
against security risk, right?

75
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,770
Pretty simple.

76
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,190
You have different workloads,
different applications on AWS,

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,740
different infrastructure
protection for those

78
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,050
is the utmost importance.

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,150
Centralizing, monitoring,
enhancing visibility

80
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,570
into potential risk.

81
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,960
So what we mean by that
is how do we do this

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,230
kind of in one place and not
in a bunch of different places

83
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,390
to make this easier for folks

84
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,000
to come to the conclusions that they need,

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,940
or the insights that they
need to derive from their data

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,143
and their security
tooling in a central spot.

87
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,590
Ultimately, we want to investigate

88
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,020
and respond to these
security issues quickly.

89
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,050
So going back to the challenge
with delayed responses,

90
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,330
how can we do this as quickly as possible

91
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,310
across the incident response

92
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,530
or security operations
kind of lifecycle, right?

93
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,680
All the way from a detection,
to an investigation,

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,193
to a response and a remediation.

95
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,110
And then we are, you know, quite aware

96
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,180
that customers are in multiple
different environments.

97
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,300
So how do we do this
across hybrid environments

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,520
and hybrid different applications,

99
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,300
and do this using AWS native services

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,683
in kind of a single place.

101
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,170
So if you're familiar with our detection

102
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,540
and response services, they really fit

103
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,120
into a few different categories.

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
So the first category
being threat detection

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,742
and workload protection.

106
00:04:56,742 --> 00:05:00,240
This is where a number of
different things happen

107
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,830
really behind the GuardDuty service.

108
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,200
And Ryan's gonna jump
into what this looks like

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,990
and how people utilize
this in more detail.

110
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,530
But we're bringing a wealth
of knowledge across AWS,

111
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,590
across our different threat intel sources,

112
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,060
and signals from our large
customer base to understand

113
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,100
where threats might be happening

114
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,210
in a customer's environment,

115
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,110
utilizing this tool, or you
know, what are the new threats

116
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,340
and kind of ever evolving threats

117
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,140
that customers need to be looking out for,

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,000
and making this ultimately easy for them

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,033
to go do this at scale.

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,580
The second piece is
vulnerability management.

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,510
So we really see this in a
couple of different tools.

122
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,340
So if you're familiar with
Inspector or Security Hub CSPM,

123
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,040
we can see an automatic discovery

124
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,490
of misconfigurations of AWS resources.

125
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,100
Like for example, you've
got some EC2 instance

126
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,290
that doesn't have EBS volume encryption,

127
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,040
or you've got public SQS queues,

128
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,340
or this may be a specific vulnerabilities

129
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,000
that we'll see in packages
and operating systems.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,720
They might be code vulnerabilities
in Lambda functions,

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,210
or it might be, you know,
vulnerability discovery

132
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,426
through CI/CD pipelines,

133
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:20,040
and this is some of the
detail that we'll jump into.

134
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,420
And then finally, risk management.

135
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,510
We have some great new information

136
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,830
to share with you all here,

137
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,290
but risk management is obviously something

138
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,980
that folks want to evaluate
across their environment.

139
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,110
So one of the things that we talk

140
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,690
to customers quite often
about is, you know,

141
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,750
how do I determine what I
should go prioritize first?

142
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,900
What is my biggest risk in my environment?

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,500
So what we wanna do as far
as the risk management pillar

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,780
and in Security Hub,
which we'll talk about

145
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,203
that was launched GA at
the keynote yesterday,

146
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,560
is to understand what is our risk posture

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,592
across our environment?

148
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:58,560
What should we go respond to first?

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
What is the context
across this environment

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,710
to understand why we should
prioritize that first,

151
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,132
and ultimately, you know,

152
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,083
to correlate this risk posture
across our environment.

153
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,320
So with that said, we'll
jump into the first service

154
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,670
and I'll let Ryan take over.

155
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,650
- Awesome, thanks, Marshall.

156
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,850
Yeah, so as Marshall mentioned,

157
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,310
our first service to talk
about is Amazon GuardDuty,

158
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,480
which if you're not familiar,

159
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,020
is our native threat detection service.

160
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,360
It's fully managed, it uses a variety

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,120
of different techniques in
order to identify threats

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,720
that could impact your
workloads, your identities,

163
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,280
including things on containers,
as well as RDS databases

164
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,140
and Lambda functions as well.

165
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,610
And one of the most important things

166
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,400
about the way that this
works is it is fully managed.

167
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,850
You don't have to feed
any of the data to us

168
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,380
for us to be able to process it.

169
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,530
We manage all of this on your
behalf behind the scenes,

170
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,470
and it helps customers
detect suspicious activity

171
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,210
or malicious activity.

172
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,880
And we have added a bunch of neat features

173
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,160
that really help analysts
get to the bottom

174
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,610
of what is going on that's
caused an alert to be created

175
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,840
with our extended threat detection,

176
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,580
which we'll talk about in detail,

177
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,330
that gives you a really deep
insight into the activity

178
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,210
that we're observing
within your environment.

179
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,680
We have some features
that we'll talk about

180
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,970
that can assist with preventing

181
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,850
or detecting the presence of ransomware.

182
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,510
And we centralize this across
your entire AWS estate.

183
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,640
So, you know, typically, most customers

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,380
don't have just one or two accounts.

185
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,040
You have a large number of AWS
accounts in most enterprises.

186
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,000
And so using the AWS
organization's integration,

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,310
we have a function called
delegated administrator,

188
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,560
which allows the organization admin

189
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,740
to delegate control of
the GuardDuty service

190
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,147
to a security-owned account.

191
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,090
And that security
operator then can control

192
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,510
and configure which
features they want enabled,

193
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,610
on which counts they
want those enabled on.

194
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,780
There's even the ability

195
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,330
to just configure it for auto-enable.

196
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,150
So if a new account is
created in the organization,

197
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,870
or if a new account gets added
to the organization later,

198
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,280
you don't have to go and keep track

199
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,840
and bootstrap that account any longer.

200
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,300
So with the organization's integration

201
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,890
and the auto-enablement feature,

202
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,780
we will just automatically
see there's a new account

203
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,970
that's added, and that you've
told us that all new accounts

204
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,490
should have this particular
security configuration,

205
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,440
we'll automatically apply that for you.

206
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,170
And we also see that the
threat detection here

207
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,510
helps customers satisfy
several different types

208
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,667
of compliance requirements
including PCI DSS.

209
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,810
So just wanna take a minute to
talk about how do we do this.

210
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,280
So the first part is getting
access to the data that we need

211
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,710
in order to identify potential threats.

212
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,300
And from a data perspective,

213
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,010
we break these into two categories.

214
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,780
The foundational data sources.

215
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,930
These are always on for all
customers that enable GuardDuty,

216
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,490
and these are flow logs, DNS
query logs, and CloudTrail.

217
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,870
Very important to point out,

218
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,670
you don't have to turn these on.

219
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,450
We get access to all of these
log sources behind the scenes,

220
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,800
directly through integrations

221
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,770
from the core service
teams that produce them.

222
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,300
This has a couple key benefits.

223
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,620
One is cost.

224
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,210
If you don't otherwise have a reason

225
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,440
that you would need to store

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,300
and actually get your flow logs,

227
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,710
you don't have to turn those on.

228
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,660
We still get to see them.

229
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,020
It also has some security
benefits as well,

230
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,210
because if a malicious
actor got, you know,

231
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,600
access to an account, they can't
go and disable a log source

232
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,183
and prevent us from getting
access to that data.

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,380
So in addition to those
foundational data sources,

234
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,560
we also have a host of,
we call protection plans.

235
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
These are add-ons that,
you know, you can enable,

236
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,810
either, again, across
the entire organization.

237
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,240
You can also pick and
choose individual accounts,

238
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,160
where you want them on.

239
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,960
One of the important things
I always like to point out

240
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,670
is each of these protection plans,

241
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,980
as well as the foundation data centers,

242
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,170
comes with a 30-day free trial.

243
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,000
So you can turn them on.

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,890
And if you have an
account that, for example,

245
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,890
isn't using EKS and you
turn on the EKS protection,

246
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,380
there's no charge for that being enabled

247
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,440
until an EKS cluster shows up.

248
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,480
So sometimes, we see
customers turn them on

249
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,730
even for services they're
not actively using.

250
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,640
And once we have all that data,

251
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,920
we look at it in several different ways.

252
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,830
So there's multiple different
ways we can detect threats.

253
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,770
In some of these threats, we
can detect, we call stateless.

254
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,100
We can look at a single event
and say, "This is not good."

255
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,030
Good example of this

256
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,910
would be threat intelligence-based
detections, right?

257
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,187
If you're querying a domain
that we know is bad, that's bad,

258
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,170
and we don't need to
see really anything else

259
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,273
in order to give you a finding for that.

260
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,910
And we get our threat intelligence

261
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,230
from several different places.

262
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,790
We partner with third parties.

263
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,840
So we partner with CrowdStrike
as well as Proofpoint.

264
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,673
So we collect that,

265
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:41,910
you don't need to have a license for that.

266
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,700
We apply that to the flows

267
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,090
and the DNS query requests
within your accounts.

268
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,920
We also generate a large amount

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,230
of threat intelligence internally

270
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,500
that we expose to customers
through GuardDuty.

271
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,880
So the Amazon act of defense

272
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,593
that runs our honeypots across the globe,

273
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,060
we get a lot of great threat
intelligence from them

274
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,090
that not only is it really good
quality threat intelligence,

275
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,470
but it's also very relevant

276
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,600
because this is threat intelligence

277
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,450
that is actually targeting our customers

278
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,583
because they're hitting our honeypots.

279
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,540
We also get threat intelligence
from our internal cert team,

280
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,690
which is looking at and trying
to protect Amazon as a whole.

281
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,120
And again, we externalize
all that by applying that

282
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,820
as threat intelligence to the workloads

283
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,293
for GuardDuty customers.

284
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,490
We also use several different
machine learning mechanisms

285
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,530
to detect behavioral anomalies.

286
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,030
And you'll see this
when we look at things,

287
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,830
like S3 access or EKS audit logs,

288
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,030
and as well as RDS logins,

289
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,940
where you can't just
look at a single event

290
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,590
and decide whether or
not it's good or bad.

291
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,570
We have to understand what is normal

292
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,090
for a particular user
or a particular bucket,

293
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,580
and then a build baselines and understand

294
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,830
whether or not the
activity that we're seeing

295
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,230
is generally consistent with

296
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,530
what we'd typically have
observed in the past.

297
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,170
And then in other cases, we
use some learning algorithms

298
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,940
that look for other types of baselines

299
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,500
that aren't really machine learning-based,

300
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,530
but still look at previous
behavioral activity

301
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,963
in order to look for deviations.

302
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,650
And then when we determine
that there's something

303
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,570
that warrants sending you a finding,

304
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,690
we first take that
information and we try to put

305
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,603
as much context into
these findings as we can.

306
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,420
So in addition to all of the data

307
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,110
that was in the source log
event that generated a finding,

308
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,780
we also expose additional context

309
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,700
that we can gather from our backend.

310
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,000
So for example, on the
machine learning findings,

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,340
we don't just tell you that
this user did something

312
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,490
that's unusual, we also
include all the information

313
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,530
that we have about what
we expected to see.

314
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,040
So what was the usual
activity that we observed

315
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,710
and then what was the
specific things that we saw

316
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,140
that were unusual in this particular case,

317
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,940
which can really usually help the kind

318
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,740
of first line responders look at

319
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,050
and determine whether or not it's,

320
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,550
you know, unusual but benign,

321
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,540
or unusual and worth
additional investigation.

322
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,040
We also add tags.

323
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,630
For resources that have tags,

324
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,580
we'll collect all the tag data, and again,

325
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,170
just trying to give as much context

326
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,480
and as much information as we can gather

327
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,820
about the resources that are impacted

328
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,260
and include those in the findings

329
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,520
to make them more actionable

330
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
because they have an additional context.

331
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,500
And all of these findings now also go

332
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,320
through our extended
threat detection analysis,

333
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,530
and I'll dive more into how
that works here in a minute.

334
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,780
And then all of our
findings, we, you know,

335
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,910
are obviously available in our console,

336
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,100
but we also send them out EventBridge.

337
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,530
So through the EventBridge integration,

338
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,860
you can send them to a
downstream seam or your SOC,

339
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,190
or other automated actions
that you might want to take.

340
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,690
We also send them to Security Hub,

341
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,450
which Marshall will show
you here in a little bit.

342
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,660
So they can be correlated
with other signals

343
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,303
that we see from within your accounts.

344
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,970
And you can also investigate
them with Detective

345
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,430
or send them through to
other partner tools as well.

346
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,730
So again, through the
EventBridge integration.

347
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,270
And then the last bit that we
have is our malware detection.

348
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,452
So from a malware perspective,

349
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,940
we allow customers to
scan their EBS volumes.

350
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,650
This is all done without any agents.

351
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,330
So there's no agents that
need to be installed,

352
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,370
no third party software to license.

353
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,960
And we do this in two different ways.

354
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,290
You can simply ask us to scan an instance

355
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,540
and we'll scan all the
volumes, but more generally,

356
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,500
what we see is customers
enable the scan on detection.

357
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,860
So we have gone through
the list of finding types

358
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,480
that we have in GuardDuty.

359
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,730
We've identified those
that are more relevant

360
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,100
for the presence of malware.

361
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,170
And so if we generate
one of those findings

362
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,960
behind the scenes, we'll
snapshot the volumes

363
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,840
for that instance, copy
them to a secure location,

364
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,580
and perform malware scan,

365
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,167
and then report back in
the presence of a finding.

366
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,590
And we'll also update the source finding

367
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,790
that created the need
for that scan as well.

368
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,160
We also offer malware scanning for S3.

369
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,190
So this was a feature that
a lot of our customers

370
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,023
were asking us for.

371
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:08,010
And it's really, especially right now,

372
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,550
targeting for the use
case of untrusted uploads.

373
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,830
So we have a lot of customers,
maybe you have a web app,

374
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,750
and your customers are sending you files

375
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,460
or uploading documents,

376
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,610
or maybe you're accepting
content from a third party.

377
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,150
And before you ingest that
into your application,

378
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,983
you wanna make sure

379
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,060
that there's no malicious
content in there.

380
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,130
So you can tell us which buckets

381
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,340
you need to have this protection on.

382
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,830
And anytime an object gets
placed in that bucket,

383
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,750
we'll immediately go and scan it,

384
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,210
and then we will tag it with the result.

385
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,520
So you can configure this in your pipeline

386
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,630
such that none of your
applications can access objects

387
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,600
that have identified as, you
know, having malicious content

388
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,680
to prevent that from getting
into your data pipelines.

389
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,410
If the file is cleaned, we'll
mark it as no threats found,

390
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,960
and then you can go ahead
and use that as a signal

391
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,060
to move it along through your application.

392
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,800
So I want to talk just a moment

393
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,390
about those different protection plans.

394
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,570
So again, these are all
the different expansions

395
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,420
that you can add, and
they add more context

396
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,400
and data into the
GuardDuty system as well,

397
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,260
which will become very
important in a minute

398
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,220
when we start to talk

399
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,370
about the extended
threat detection feature.

400
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,400
So S3 protection enables us

401
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,610
to take visibility into S3 data events.

402
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,980
So from a CloudTrail perspective

403
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,860
that's part of the
foundational data sources.

404
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,450
We see the management events

405
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,180
and that would include some S3 events,

406
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,530
like list buckets for example.

407
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,510
But it doesn't include the data events,

408
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,720
like get object, put
object, delete object.

409
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,040
So what is the actual activity

410
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,010
that a user is performing within a bucket?

411
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,810
With the SV protection turned on,

412
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,370
we get access to all of those logs.

413
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,110
And again, you don't have to turn

414
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,700
the data events on yourself,

415
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,820
we get 'em directly
from S3 on the backend.

416
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,160
And we use this to, again, build profiles

417
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,140
of normal activity for a bucket.

418
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,120
It's a particular bucket normally used

419
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,720
to as an input bucket, where
it's lots mostly rights.

420
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,230
We're suddenly seeing large
data being exfiltrated from it.

421
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,580
We also look at the principles

422
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,100
in which buckets they
tend to interface with

423
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,140
and how they do that actions

424
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,233
in order to identify
potentially anomalous behavior.

425
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,560
We also have our EKS protection.

426
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,283
So this gives us access
to the EKS audit logs.

427
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,180
And this is kind of similar
to your CloudTrail for EKS,

428
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,310
it's the control plane activity, you know,

429
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,470
what types of of pods are being created,

430
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,500
what types of activity is taking place

431
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,600
on that EKS controller itself.

432
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,850
Again, in order to
identify misconfigurations

433
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,060
like, you know, making
it publicly accessible

434
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,550
or also unusual activity, like suddenly,

435
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,410
we're seeing privileged containers

436
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,290
that we haven't seen in
your account previously.

437
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,990
That could be an indication
of an identity compromise.

438
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,870
We have our RDS protection.

439
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,680
So this looks at anomalous
behavior for logins

440
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,390
to database themselves.

441
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,490
So this is really on the
kind of the data plane

442
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,840
of the database and allow us
to profile what are the users,

443
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,210
what databases do they normally log in to,

444
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,820
where do they log in from,
other activity of that nature,

445
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,843
and to identify logins that
seem suspicious or unusual.

446
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,180
We have our Lambda protection,

447
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,750
which gives us visibility
into the network connections

448
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,860
for your Lambda functions.

449
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,800
So whether or not maybe you've downloaded

450
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,440
a third party library
that has been compromised,

451
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
and maybe your Lambda functions
are reaching out to command

452
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,210
and control or to crypto mine.

453
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,520
This'll give us visibility
into the flow log data

454
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,660
in order to identify
those malicious net flows.

455
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,510
And this works both for VPC-enabled

456
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,880
as well as non-VPC-enabled
Lambda functions.

457
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,830
So we'll get that visibility regardless

458
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:53,460
of the networking
configuration that you've used.

459
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,110
And then the last one is
our runtime monitoring.

460
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,400
So runtime monitoring
ads and EVPF-based agents

461
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,920
to your compute workload in order for us

462
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,350
to get even more context and visibility

463
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,480
into the activity that's taking place.

464
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,590
This is especially important

465
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,720
for containerized workloads, right?

466
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,670
Because if we're just
looking at the instance level

467
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,490
and you've got a hundred
pods on an instance,

468
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,760
knowing in the flow log
data isn't super helpful.

469
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,670
This will give us visibility
down to the process ID,

470
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,384
as well as all the lineage of the process

471
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:28,384
that was creating any flow
data or looking up any domains,

472
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,510
as well as executing processes.

473
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,450
And we support all of
our major compute types.

474
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,050
So we support Fargate,
we support ECS on EC2,

475
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,650
EKS as well as EC2
instances by themselves.

476
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,950
And we built this in a way
to make it fully managed

477
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,270
and really lightweight.

478
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,830
So again, it's EVPF-based.

479
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,430
So the agent itself, it
doesn't have any, you know,

480
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,380
kernel driver requirements.

481
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,410
But in order to make it
even more lightweight,

482
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,090
we designed this in such a fashion

483
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,250
that the runtime sensor itself

484
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,270
doesn't have really any
rules or logic built into it.

485
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,920
It's really collecting all this data

486
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,190
and it streams it to our
backend through a VPC endpoint.

487
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,450
And this allows us to
have a lot more expensive

488
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,180
and computationally expensive
rules and detection content

489
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,250
on the backend 'cause it's on our compute.

490
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,620
It also means that you never have to worry

491
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,420
about whether or not you
have an updated rule set

492
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,700
because all of those
rules are on our backend.

493
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,640
We can push an update
for an emergent threat,

494
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
and every single one of the millions

495
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,630
of agents out there automatically
have that protection.

496
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,630
So we're able to detect that very quickly.

497
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,450
And we can do this deployment
for you in a lot of cases.

498
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,320
So for EKS, we have a direct
integration on the back end

499
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,870
with the EKS service that allows us

500
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,570
to identify all EKS workloads
within your account.

501
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,030
And whenever there's a new
cluster that's created,

502
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,770
we'll create a managed add-on

503
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,230
that will add a Damon
set to all of your hosts,

504
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,440
and make sure that those
sensors are running.

505
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,800
For Fargate, again, your
developers don't need

506
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,710
to make any changes to their deployments.

507
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,800
If the GuardDuty Fargate
runtime is enabled,

508
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,950
when they submit a deployment
just as they would normally,

509
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,990
Fargate will see that the security admin

510
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,940
has chose to enable runtime,

511
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,430
and it will inject a sidecar
container into that deployment,

512
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,530
automatically making it very easy

513
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,320
and seamless for them
to get that protection.

514
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,110
For EC2 instances, we
leveraged systems manager

515
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,910
to affect those deployments as well.

516
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,040
And all of these also create
additional signal for,

517
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,434
which is one of our more recent launches,

518
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,399
which is extended threat detection.

519
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,210
So we originally launched
the extended threat detection

520
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,450
at this last re:Invent, looking
at two key data sources.

521
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,230
So the CloudTrail data source
and the S3 data source.

522
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,220
And we had two findings.

523
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,370
One was compromised credential,
one was compromised data,

524
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,560
so depending on which data source

525
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,620
was contributing more to the logic.

526
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,760
And what we're doing here

527
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,670
is we're taking these
input signals and findings,

528
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,500
and we're applying some machine learning

529
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,380
and AI to those in order
to identify whether or not

530
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,870
it looks like a multi-stage attack

531
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,780
that is coming from multiple
different data sources

532
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,600
and also spanning lots
of different events.

533
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,500
We're also looking at and
adding additional signals

534
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,850
that maybe aren't findings.

535
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,190
So we have this concept of weak signals,

536
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,160
where there's something we
know about an IP address

537
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,030
or a domain and it's not
necessarily enough by itself

538
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,590
to generate a finding.

539
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,320
But when we look at that in hindsight

540
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,540
with other information that's now come in,

541
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,040
we can actually apply that to that

542
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,980
and then again raise the severity on that.

543
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,840
And then when we generate these findings,

544
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,910
they come with all of the context

545
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,600
around which MITRE tactics
and techniques that we saw,

546
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,700
as well as all the resources
that were involved,

547
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,320
all the identities that were used,

548
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,568
and a timeline that shows
you when the attack started,

549
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:52,140
when it ended, what
were all of the actions

550
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,430
that we saw in between,

551
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,380
as well as a human readable explanation

552
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,870
that should allow your incident responder

553
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,260
to very quickly understand
what resources were impacted,

554
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,653
and why we felt that this
needed to generate this finding.

555
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,130
So a couple things about the
extended threat detection.

556
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,500
First of all, there's no
additional cost for this

557
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,900
above and beyond the GuardDuty service

558
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,550
and which those protection plans

559
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,260
that you have turned on.

560
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,330
Again, it completely integrated.

561
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,380
We also add those additional
weak signals to these models

562
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,830
in order for us to
really enrich the output.

563
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,560
And we use a lot of the data
that we have visibility to

564
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,900
about what are we seeing threat actors

565
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,790
in AWS customer accounts doing

566
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,800
in order to train a lot of these models,

567
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,650
and allows us to quickly update these

568
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,110
to identify new and emergent threats.

569
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,650
And when we send out, these
just come as a new finding type.

570
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,010
So the finding types start
with the word attack sequence

571
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,530
and this allows you to consume this,

572
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,450
just as you would your
other finding types, too.

573
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,060
So if you have existing
workload, workflows,

574
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,590
or existing integrations,

575
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,140
these findings will just
go simply to them as well.

576
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,640
So again, we originally
launched with the first two.

577
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,070
At re:Inforce this year, we launched

578
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,650
the compromised clusters for EKS,

579
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,340
which combined CloudTrail, S3 data events,

580
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,210
as well as EKS audit logs
and EKS runtime data.

581
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,490
And then yesterday, during Matt's keynote,

582
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,920
we launched the final two of these,

583
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,140
which is our compromised
compute workloads,

584
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,240
which looks for compromised instances.

585
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,600
So just EC2 instances
that have been compromised

586
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,660
as well as compromised ECS clusters.

587
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,100
So again, for ECS also,
it supports ECS on Fargate

588
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,623
and or ECS on EC2.

589
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,140
One of the other announcements
that we made actually

590
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,810
in the road to re:Invent
just a little over a week ago

591
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,970
was the launch of GuardDuty
Malware Protection

592
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,380
for AWS Backup.

593
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,360
So as I mentioned before,
we already had malware

594
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,660
for EBS and for S3, and what this adds

595
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,940
is the ability for you to seamlessly add

596
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,460
native malware detection
for your AWS backups,

597
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,980
both for EBS as well as S3.

598
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,320
And this can be enabled by checking a box,

599
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,690
no additional software to buy or license,

600
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,590
and no additional compute
required to do this.

601
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,630
It also allows us to automatically scan

602
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,550
new backups as they're created.

603
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,636
And from a cost perspective,
we do incremental scanning

604
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:20,280
once an additional scan has been made.

605
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,890
And then very importantly, you
can also do on-demand scans

606
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,574
at any time if you wanna re-scan something

607
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:28,290
with more of the latest virus definitions.

608
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,280
And also, you can have it
so the scans run on restore

609
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,740
to make sure that before you
restore any of your content

610
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,610
that it's been scanned

611
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,103
with the latest malware
definitions as well.

612
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,750
And this can be integrated
into a workflow,

613
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,170
also to prevent an infected backup

614
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,750
from reaching like your
air gap vault for example.

615
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,430
So in this case, we have a backup

616
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,500
that's being backed up from the resources.

617
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
As we are performing that scan

618
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,579
or if we're performing incremental scan

619
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,030
to some of that change that data,

620
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,910
we will mark it as infected
if there's malware,

621
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,017
and that can trigger a
results where you will say,

622
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:05,250
"I don't want this to
get into my air gap vault

623
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,380
to make sure that it
doesn't get committed,"

624
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,523
and that you don't accidentally
back up infected content.

625
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,600
So with that I will show you

626
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,620
what a couple of these look like.

627
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,280
So again, as I mentioned,

628
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,280
this is the EC2
compromised instance group,

629
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,200
the new extended threat detection.

630
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,370
And the first thing you'll notice

631
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,070
is we give you a start and stop time.

632
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,010
So this finding can be
continuously updated.

633
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,230
If we see additional activity,

634
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,900
this same exact attack
sequence will get updated

635
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,120
with a new end time, as
well as all the new data.

636
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,910
So it can be a living finding

637
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,430
if that activity still is continuing.

638
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,263
And we'll tell you

639
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:49,590
what were the different
types of resources.

640
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,520
So namely in this one,
we had some EC2 instances

641
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,950
that all shared the same instance profile,

642
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,320
and we'll tell you what
instances we saw the activity,

643
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,640
and then the MITRE techniques

644
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,250
and tactics that we saw along the way,

645
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,570
as well as some of the data

646
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,550
around the networks that were involved,

647
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,100
and whether or not there
was malicious processes

648
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,950
or a malware that was identified
in this process as well.

649
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,470
All of this will show you the
MITRE tactics in a nice chart,

650
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,000
so you can see what
were the different types

651
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,380
of attacks that we saw.

652
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,110
And then over on the right,
you can see the full timeline,

653
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,820
starting from the first event that we saw

654
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,070
that we correlated to this attack,

655
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,900
and then all the way down to the end,

656
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,390
including which processes were involved,

657
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,880
if there was a process ID,
if there was runtime data,

658
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,150
just to give you as much
context as to why we felt

659
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,823
that this was likely a
a compromised instance.

660
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:45,810
So also, I wanted to show you real quick

661
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,550
what the S3 backup looks like.

662
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,180
So if you were to try to
backup a piece of malware,

663
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,030
not only do we show it
in the AWS Backup console

664
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,950
so the backup user can be aware

665
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,720
that there was somehow malware identified,

666
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,030
but it will also generate a
finding on the GuardDuty side

667
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,180
so the security team can also
get visibility into this,

668
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,440
and it will show you information

669
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,420
about what the backup vault was

670
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,430
and also what was the
malware that was fined.

671
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,193
In this case, we used a test EICAR file.

672
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,690
And then lastly, one other launch

673
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,120
that I did want to talk about
that wasn't in our keynote,

674
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,770
but I think is also very cool

675
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,840
and our customers really like.

676
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,310
We had a feature in GuardDuty

677
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,590
for a long time called suppression rules.

678
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,450
And the concept of a suppression rule

679
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,790
was if there was activity
in your environment

680
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,980
that was normal for you

681
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,600
and you would like us to stop telling you

682
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,433
that we're looking at it,

683
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,420
even though it might
trigger one of our rules,

684
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,800
you can create a suppression rule.

685
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,420
The suppression rules previously

686
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,850
were required exact matches though,

687
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,450
so we've added some additional
flexibility to this feature,

688
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,790
where you can now use wild cards.

689
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,680
And that's really useful
in a lot of cases,

690
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,480
where you can use like
either a question mark

691
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,220
or a star or not matches.

692
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,260
So you can say this matches a string

693
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,480
with a wild card or not matches.

694
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,970
So again, just additional flexibility

695
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,440
in creating these rules, so that way,

696
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,420
you can help tune the output

697
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,643
that we're sending you in our findings.

698
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,800
All right, and now with that,

699
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,040
I wanna move on to talk
a little about Inspector.

700
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,660
So inspectors are
vulnerability assessment tool

701
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,130
that is built specifically

702
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,110
for kind of cloud-native applications.

703
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,540
So unlike a traditional like enterprise

704
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,373
vulnerability scanner,

705
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,510
it's not something where
you schedule a scan.

706
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,120
We do continuous scans
and we also support scans

707
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,580
across a lot of all
different cloud constructs.

708
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,760
So with EC2, we also
support containing register.

709
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,430
So if you're pushing
your containers to ECR,

710
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,410
they can be scanned on push,

711
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,410
and make sure that your developers

712
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,270
will even get notice of this as well.

713
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,600
So when there's a vulnerability
identified in the ECR,

714
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,330
we also notify the developer
that this has happened,

715
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,790
so that way, they also can take action.

716
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,770
We can also support scanning of code,

717
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,800
so Lambda function code, as
well as code repositories

718
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,683
that we'll talk about
some more in a minute.

719
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,440
So again, this helps you identify

720
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,030
those software vulnerabilities that exist

721
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,530
across your cloud platform,

722
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,600
as well as unintended network exposure.

723
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,110
So one of the other
things that Inspector does

724
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,027
is it will look at network reachability.

725
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,860
And we use some automated reasoning,

726
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,750
so it supports, for example,

727
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,130
if something's behind a load balancer

728
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,870
or it might not have a public IP,

729
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,260
but we can deduce that it is
actually publicly accessible

730
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,510
if it's behind a load balancer

731
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,280
that's publicly accessible, right?

732
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,830
So helps you understand
which of your resources

733
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,213
are on the public internet.

734
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,410
We use network reachability
as well as other contexts

735
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,940
that we have about things,

736
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,000
like is it actively being
exploited in the wild?

737
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,250
Are we seeing that this,

738
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,390
we know there's an exploit available

739
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,190
and we're actually seeing
it being exploited.

740
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,450
We will use that context to
help prioritize remediation.

741
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,920
One of the other things that we'll use

742
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,100
for prioritization is,
is it in use, right?

743
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,240
So especially important

744
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,640
from a container workload standpoint.

745
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,280
If you have a lot of containers
in a container registry,

746
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,673
odds are you're gonna have
vulnerabilities in some of them.

747
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,000
All of those are things you
probably want to fix eventually,

748
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,980
but the ones you probably want to fix now

749
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,110
are the ones that are actually being run

750
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,600
on your ECS or EKS workload.

751
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,150
So if you're using ECS or EKS,

752
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,280
we will not only show you the containers

753
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,780
in the registry that have vulnerabilities,

754
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,370
we'll show you which ones are being used,

755
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,060
and use that to help prioritize

756
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:35,460
which vulnerabilities
you should address first.

757
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,720
And then we also have a lot of features

758
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,460
that really help our customers shift left

759
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,650
into the development cycle.

760
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,560
And you know, first of all,
there's an API that you can use

761
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,720
to call in your CI/CD pipelines

762
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,480
that will allow you to
detect the vulnerabilities

763
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,370
in the build process
and then block the bill.

764
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,550
We also have integrations with Kiro

765
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,500
and Q Developer that will allow you

766
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,070
to notify your developers
as they're writing code

767
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,990
if they're about to import
a vulnerable package,

768
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,980
for example.

769
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,260
So we can bring that all
the way to the developer

770
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,850
before the code's even committed,

771
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,960
or if it's in the pipeline

772
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,270
as it's getting built
in the CI/CD pipeline.

773
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,640
The idea being, we want to prioritize

774
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,190
identifying the most impactful
vulnerabilities you have

775
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,420
in your running workloads.

776
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,370
But ideally, if we can
stop a vulnerability

777
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,887
from ever reaching production,

778
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,883
that's obviously the best case.

779
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:24,810
We use systems manager to
do the continuous scanning

780
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,340
for EC2 instances.

781
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,260
However, if you're not
using systems manager,

782
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,500
we can still scan your
EC2 volumes agently,

783
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,780
agentlessly as well.

784
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,740
And for our code scanning
with Lambda functions

785
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,860
as well as code repos,
we don't just tell you

786
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,020
there's a problem, we'll use Gen AI

787
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,150
to generate a remediation action,

788
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,220
including a patch that you can download

789
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,223
to can just commit that
will fix the vulnerability.

790
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
And I'll give you an example
of how some of these work here.

791
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,698
So this is an example of a Lambda function

792
00:34:04,698 --> 00:34:07,350
that has a vulnerability.

793
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,550
In this case, this is a
vulnerability for log injection.

794
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,680
So you can see in this
case, we don't just tell you

795
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,290
which function it is and why
we think this is a problem,

796
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,170
we'll point you to the
line of code specifically

797
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,720
that is causing this vulnerability.

798
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,480
We'll give you an
explanation of why we think

799
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,940
what you've done here is not a good idea,

800
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,310
as well as a recommended fix.

801
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,720
So here's the change you can make,

802
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,390
you can download this
patch, and just commit that,

803
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,553
and it'll fix that vulnerability for you.

804
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,837
Similarly, we support integrating

805
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:42,720
with third party code
repositories as well.

806
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,760
And in the same idea,
we will scan your code

807
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,170
and your GitHub environments
and scan not just the code,

808
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,200
but also infrastructure is code.

809
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,170
So if you have cloud formation
or Terraform templates,

810
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,970
then we can look at those identified

811
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,940
potential vulnerabilities in those,

812
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,180
for example, in this case, this Terraform

813
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,890
will create an EKS cluster

814
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,020
that will be accessible to the internet.

815
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,460
It's not usually a great idea.

816
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,680
So we'll show you exactly
where in your Terraform

817
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,450
we think you've made this mistake

818
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,150
and give you the recommended
fix, again, with a patch

819
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,680
that you can just simply commit and apply,

820
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,880
and then make the the
vulnerability go away.

821
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,560
With that, I'm gonna hand
it back over to Marshall.

822
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,743
- All right.

823
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,740
All right, so we've talked
about vulnerabilities,

824
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,240
we've talked about threat detection,

825
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,096
now we're gonna go into risk management.

826
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:36,420
So in this space, we'll
discuss Security Hub.

827
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,460
So this is something that we launched GA

828
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,140
in Matt's keynote yesterday,

829
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,400
Security Hub is being our
unified security solution.

830
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,590
Really, what we were
working backwards from here

831
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,260
is some of these different inputs

832
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,286
that you see on the left side,

833
00:35:51,286 --> 00:35:52,560
like our threats and our vulnerabilities,

834
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,120
we also have things that we didn't cover,

835
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,580
such as Security Hub CSPM.

836
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,990
This is the configuration
of AWS resources,

837
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,270
what might be misconfigured,

838
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,550
not leading to kind of best practices

839
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,370
of how you would configure
different resources

840
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,770
in the most secure way.

841
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,410
There's also other things
like the network exposures

842
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,640
from Inspector, sensitive
data from Amazon Macie

843
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,520
that you can discover in Amazon S3,

844
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,220
as well as access analyzer
that can do things,

845
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,420
like tell you that you've created
a trust policy that share,

846
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,590
that lets somebody outside

847
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,960
of your organization assume a role

848
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,700
or helps with understanding
when policies are not configured

849
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,830
to be least privileged.

850
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,160
So bringing a number of
these different signals

851
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,600
into one place so that
folks can understand,

852
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,050
what is my risk posture across
a number of different things?

853
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,690
So not just, hey, I have a threat here

854
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,580
or I have a vulnerability here,

855
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,110
but let's bring these things together

856
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,350
and understand what resources
are creating the most risk

857
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,140
in our environment that we
should go address first.

858
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,190
So if you think back to some

859
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,950
of those challenges we
went over in the beginning

860
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,520
about, you know, where
do I prioritize my time?

861
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,250
How do I take signals from various tools

862
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,880
and bring them together, you know,

863
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,120
it's ultimately what we want to accomplish

864
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,850
so folks can respond more quickly,

865
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,143
respond across their organization

866
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:22,593
with the correct prioritization.

867
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,220
So as we introduce Security Hub,

868
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,230
there is a number of different components

869
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,540
that we're helping customers with here.

870
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,480
So kind of once again, unifying
these security operations

871
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
across your organization,
with Security Hub,

872
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,180
as you'll see in a minute,
we'll go through in the console.

873
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,980
This is also helping with some

874
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,510
of those deployment capabilities.

875
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:50,190
So before GuardDuty and
Inspector and Security Hub CSPM

876
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,064
are things that you would
go configure individually

877
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:56,733
across different regions
across your organization.

878
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,570
Now it was easy to do from a number

879
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,450
of an account standpoint, but
they were still individual

880
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,850
in the nature of deployment.

881
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,010
With Security Hub, we're
introducing the ability

882
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,930
to be able to configure everything

883
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,523
from one central location.

884
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,080
And then that way, we can
have that risk context

885
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,690
brought in together and prioritized,

886
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,620
as well as being able to
streamline the response.

887
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,820
So now that we have all
of this information,

888
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,587
we have different integrations

889
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,500
with different ticketing services,

890
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,690
such as Jira and ServiceNow,

891
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,740
as well as integrations
with Amazon EventBridge

892
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,720
with all these findings,
where you can create

893
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,810
your own response actions if necessary.

894
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,450
Maybe that's tagging
some sort of instance,

895
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,760
maybe that's actually making some sort

896
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,083
of mutating action to
remediate what's going on.

897
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,240
So you'll see some of the key capabilities

898
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,380
that we are introducing in Security Hub.

899
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,750
The first one being these
exposure-based findings.

900
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,260
So we previously had
Security Hub CSPM findings,

901
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,390
we have GuardDuty findings,
Inspector findings,

902
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,160
access analyzer findings.

903
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,420
When we bring these all together

904
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,760
to create a risk-based finding,

905
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,960
that is what we're talking about

906
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
when we're talking
about exposure findings.

907
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,590
Another capability that we're
introducing in Security Hub

908
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,180
is in attack path.

909
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,210
So we actually see in a visualization

910
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,490
of the interconnected resources.

911
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,370
And for example, like the
openings between them.

912
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,760
So say for example, you
have an internet gateway

913
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,230
that has certain ports open,

914
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,450
maybe it's just all
ports open to the world.

915
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,180
We can trace that back to our EC2 instance

916
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,500
that's got vulnerabilities,

917
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,080
it's got over permissive instance profiles

918
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,340
associated with it, it has
access to sensitive data and S3,

919
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,670
and you can see visually all
of this different information

920
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,383
and how it's all interconnected.

921
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,930
Another key functionality in Security Hub

922
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,240
is an asset inventory.

923
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,240
One of the things that I've always heard

924
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,360
being a security professional
is you you can't protect

925
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,460
what you don't know exists.

926
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,260
So coming back to that data problem

927
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,630
that I talked a little bit about earlier,

928
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,020
we're introducing an asset
inventory that folks can go

929
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,300
and understand what
exists in an environment,

930
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,800
what exists across your organization,

931
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,620
whether that's five
accounts or 5,000 accounts,

932
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,910
doesn't really matter.

933
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,625
We can see all the different assets,

934
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,550
how many different EC2
instances, IAM roles,

935
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,880
and then what are the findings
associated with each one?

936
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,380
So now you're not working backwards

937
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,887
from a finding and saying,

938
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:38,100
"Okay, there's this one finding associated

939
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,570
with my EC2 instance.

940
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,160
I wonder what else is associated with it?"

941
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,200
Like what other problems does it have?

942
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,780
You can work backwards
from an actual resource,

943
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,610
you can filter by what resources

944
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,860
have the most different findings,

945
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,360
if it's got the most vulnerabilities,

946
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,790
it's got GuardDuty findings
associated with it,

947
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,280
Security Hub CSPM findings, and so on.

948
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,060
So very powerful from an asset inventory

949
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,500
and working backwards from the resource

950
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,570
instead of working
backwards from a finding,

951
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,220
depending on the different use case

952
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,873
and the investigation scenarios.

953
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,070
And then ultimately, with this correlation

954
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,700
and these different signals
helping with the triage,

955
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,800
now we're getting you closer to the answer

956
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,067
that you needed to go say,

957
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,440
"Here's what I need to go remediate,

958
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,600
here's who I need to go contact,

959
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,610
who has access to these resources,"

960
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,620
instead of you putting all these pieces

961
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,290
of the puzzle together and
then going to a response.

962
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,600
We're putting those pieces
of the puzzle for you.

963
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,060
That way, you can get to
your decisions faster,

964
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,410
get to your alerting faster.

965
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,810
And we're also helping that
through those integrations

966
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,660
with things like ServiceNow and Jira.

967
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,150
All right, so with that said,

968
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,343
I'm gonna show you what this looks like.

969
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,150
All right.

970
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,030
So another thing that we didn't touch on

971
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,300
in the slides yet is cost estimation.

972
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,440
So obviously, anything that
you do in the AWS console

973
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,890
from, you know, enabling
a service a lot of times

974
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,240
has a cost associated with it.

975
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,187
One thing we've heard from customers is,

976
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:10,170
"Hey, I need to know how
much this is going to cost

977
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,430
before I turn it on.

978
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,130
I might need to get approvals
from my finance department."

979
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,870
Now with all of these different services,

980
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,610
everything we've talked
about to this point,

981
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,830
they all have different free trials.

982
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,320
Those free trials might be 15 days

983
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,750
for things like Security
Lake and Inspector,

984
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,870
they might be 30 days
for things like GuardDuty

985
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,493
and Security Hub CSPM.

986
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,660
All of those different
services have usage spaces.

987
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,370
So you can see exactly what
that service would cost you

988
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,480
during that free trial.

989
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,210
And you can have an exact estimate.

990
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,250
With the cost estimator

991
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,070
that we're introducing in Security Hub,

992
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,960
this is an ability to
create an estimate based

993
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,820
on what we can see from cost

994
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,670
and cost explorer in your environment.

995
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,040
So based on historical patterns,

996
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,630
which does obviously not
exactly a projection out

997
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,150
to the future, but based
on historical patterns,

998
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,920
this is what it would cost for
you to turn on this service.

999
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,793
And when I talk about
turning on this service,

1000
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,053
there we go.

1001
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,660
One of the other things
that we've introduced here

1002
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,520
is simplified pricing.

1003
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,660
So before, if you turn on GuardDuty,

1004
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,280
it had a line item associated with it,

1005
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,320
different protection
plans associated with it.

1006
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,230
If you had Security Hub CSPM turned on,

1007
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,060
it has line items and it became, you know,

1008
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,560
kind of complex pretty quickly, right?

1009
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,090
There's a a number of different line items

1010
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,200
that you need to decipher

1011
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,050
on how much is this costing me in total.

1012
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,050
With this simplified pricing,
we're essentially bundling

1013
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,530
what we see customers
normally use together.

1014
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,250
So we have this showing in
a couple of different ways.

1015
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,160
So in a couple of different packages.

1016
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,500
So Security Hub essential capabilities,

1017
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,154
so this is Security Hub CSPM,

1018
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:04,914
Inspector scanning for things like CIS

1019
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:07,530
and ECR, and Lambda and EC2,

1020
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,253
also GuardDuty foundational data sources,

1021
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:16,410
and malware protection for EC2.

1022
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,360
One of the the different components here

1023
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,250
is to be able to create these
rich exposure -based findings.

1024
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,820
Getting that data into Security Hub

1025
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,920
to be able to create those findings.

1026
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,230
This is kind of the
baseline amount of services

1027
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,440
that is what's needed to do that.

1028
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,030
And with that, we've also gone

1029
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,310
to an easier way to estimate this.

1030
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,340
So it's now per resource-based pricing

1031
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,770
instead of usage-based pricing.

1032
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,550
So for example, usage-based
pricing in the past,

1033
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,710
folks would need to understand,

1034
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,310
well, what are the usual
trends in my environment?

1035
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,710
And obviously with the
cloud, you can scale up,

1036
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,943
you can scale down.

1037
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,100
It looks like Ryan's got
somewhere to go after this.

1038
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,920
But yeah, you could scale
up, you can scale down.

1039
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,620
You don't really know
what exactly that might be

1040
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,123
over a month's time.

1041
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,780
With the usage-based
pricing, we can take it,

1042
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,990
we can understand like an
average of EC2 instances

1043
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,693
across the time and come
up with a better estimate.

1044
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,130
And then one thing to note
that you'll see on here

1045
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,420
is when you do this
different bundled pricing,

1046
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,560
we also give a more
competitive pricing rate

1047
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,700
associated with using all
of these things together.

1048
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,860
You know, you're opting in to
a number of different features

1049
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,840
and if you do that, right,

1050
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,240
there's different cost
advantages to doing that.

1051
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,080
One thing to note is you can
use these still, individually,

1052
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,000
but if you want to take advantage

1053
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,900
of the easier simplified
pricing, you know,

1054
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,911
we definitely encourage you
to take advantage of this.

1055
00:45:57,911 --> 00:45:59,820
But you can do this either way.

1056
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,260
And then another thing here

1057
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,480
is if there's the different essentials,

1058
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,250
you can turn on just the essentials.

1059
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,220
You can turn on the essentials
plus threat analytics,

1060
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,840
as well as additional capabilities,

1061
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,080
which today exists with
Inspector Lambda code scanning

1062
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,540
and kind of adding these
things on, you know,

1063
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,393
piecemeal based on what you
want out of your environment.

1064
00:46:24,964 --> 00:46:28,380
So let's go to what this
looks like in the console.

1065
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,860
So Security Hub, we've kind of,

1066
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,900
this is the new Security Hub page.

1067
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,420
So if you haven't had
a chance to see this,

1068
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,000
definitely come give this a look.

1069
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,560
One of the things that we've introduced

1070
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,530
and one thing I failed to
mention earlier, sorry,

1071
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:47,880
is this was in public preview
at re:Inforce this year,

1072
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,880
and then obviously yesterday,
we did the GA announcement.

1073
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,250
There are some new things in here.

1074
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,810
If you looked at this in
public preview before,

1075
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,370
you're gonna see some new things,

1076
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,460
such as the trends in this.

1077
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,730
So for example, you can
see in a day over day

1078
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,100
or week over week, and then you can see

1079
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,220
across these different finding types.

1080
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,280
So for example, the
threats from GuardDuty,

1081
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,010
the exposures from Security Hub,

1082
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,710
you can see your amount of resources,

1083
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,877
total amount of findings.

1084
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,640
And if you scroll down, we
have some different charts

1085
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,160
and things that you can filter by.

1086
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,590
You know, say for example
you only wanna see

1087
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:28,230
your critical level threats

1088
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,980
and you can kind of see what
this looks like over time.

1089
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,720
Another key widget that's
on this summary page

1090
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,460
is security coverage.

1091
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,040
So talking to security
professionals a lot,

1092
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,140
one of the questions is,
"Hey, I wanna make sure

1093
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,080
that I have this coverage everywhere.

1094
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,870
You know, it's part of our
standard operating procedures.

1095
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,900
I need to tell an auditor that
we have these capabilities

1096
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,820
across our environment, and I need to know

1097
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,730
that that's what we have."

1098
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,180
So now, we're giving that
information to make sure

1099
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,920
that folks have an easy way to see

1100
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,740
that you have coverage
everywhere versus, you know,

1101
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,050
going out and looking at
the different consoles

1102
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,850
and understanding what exists there.

1103
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,670
And then, like I said earlier,

1104
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,670
we are actually making
this a little bit easier

1105
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:20,760
for folks to understand what exists.

1106
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,580
So the account coverage, we can see this,

1107
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,760
that, hey, all of these different accounts

1108
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,560
in our demo environment,
we have 100% on everything.

1109
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,420
But you could see what accounts

1110
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,770
have vulnerability management,

1111
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,620
what accounts have the threat analytics,

1112
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,110
which ones have sensitive
data discovery configured

1113
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,210
or posture management.

1114
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,743
And then you can configure these

1115
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,150
based on these different data types.

1116
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,480
So Security Hub, the essentials,

1117
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,540
based on like what we were
seeing from that pricing page,

1118
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,060
the threat analytics for GuardDuty,

1119
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,620
and this is once again policies

1120
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,230
that you can set at an OU level.

1121
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,020
You can set across an whole organization.

1122
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,850
And from here, Security Hub will make sure

1123
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,310
that you have all of these
capabilities turned on,

1124
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,140
or you know, whether
you have five accounts,

1125
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,290
whether you have 5,000
accounts based on that policy.

1126
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,360
And then obviously,
switching it up if you need,

1127
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,580
you know, maybe different coverage per OU

1128
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
or something, right?

1129
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,600
And then moving on here to,

1130
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,150
what does these exposure
findings look like?

1131
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,000
So we talked a little bit about this.

1132
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,940
Let's scroll down here and
look at just the first one.

1133
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,180
We can see that the
potential finding title

1134
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,190
is potential resource hijacking,

1135
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,980
EC2 instance with an open security group

1136
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,930
has software vulnerabilities.

1137
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,650
This groups by the different EC2 instances

1138
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,050
that have this risk.

1139
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,490
If I go ahead and click on one of these,

1140
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,960
and I'm actually gonna expand the view,

1141
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,910
so hopefully you all can see it better.

1142
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,560
So if we look at this,
we get like a, you know,

1143
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,900
basic summary at the top.

1144
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,095
This instance has
accessible within the VPC

1145
00:50:07,095 --> 00:50:08,850
and has low priority vulnerabilities,

1146
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:11,815
exposing this instance
to resource hijacking.

1147
00:50:11,815 --> 00:50:15,570
One of the things that
folks usually ask about is,

1148
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,270
hey, I've got vulnerabilities,
they're critical.

1149
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:21,210
They're a remote code
execution vulnerability,

1150
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:22,890
but we don't actually,

1151
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,140
this instance doesn't have
access to the internet.

1152
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,900
So you know, somebody
couldn't exploit that.

1153
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,280
So those are the types of things

1154
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,390
that we're helping customers
bring to the surface here.

1155
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,570
Maybe you do have some critical
level of vulnerability,

1156
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,070
but it's remote code injection

1157
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,670
and it's not exposed to the internet.

1158
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,070
So that's maybe not as severe as,

1159
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,350
hey, you've got this
medium level severity,

1160
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,950
but this instance has every port,

1161
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,440
every IP open to the world.

1162
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,260
So, you know, it's kind
of just a matter of time.

1163
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,210
That's something we should go prioritize

1164
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,323
and focus our time on.

1165
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,240
If we look at this one though,

1166
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,973
we can see the attack
path here, little small,

1167
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,590
but we can see everything that's involved.

1168
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,470
So like the EC2 instance, what's the VPC?

1169
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,950
The different IAM role, the IAM
policies associated with it.

1170
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,360
So we can see, you know,

1171
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,980
not only does this thing
have vulnerabilities,

1172
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,180
but it's got an IAM policy

1173
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,680
that's named administrator access.

1174
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,833
So most likely, an administrator.

1175
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,460
We can see the contributing traits.

1176
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,320
So if we think of contributing traits,

1177
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,250
this is where the underlying
detection sources,

1178
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,860
so the things like threats.

1179
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,860
In this case, misconfiguration
with the security group,

1180
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,900
vulnerabilities associated
with that EC2 instance.

1181
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,573
We can see all the different traits there.

1182
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,403
Let me go up.

1183
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,130
Once again, we can see the traits

1184
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,190
or we can see the different
resources involved with this.

1185
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,790
So there's, you know, an EC2
instance, a security group,

1186
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,920
the subnet, and an IAM role.

1187
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,510
This is specifically the things

1188
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,450
that need to go be
remediated all in one spot

1189
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,373
from multiple different sources.

1190
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,093
All right.

1191
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:10,763
Cool.

1192
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,873
So with that, let's go back here.

1193
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,710
So why build Security Hub in this way?

1194
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:23,280
Why customers would want
to use Security Hub, right?

1195
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,040
We're trying to unify these
different data sources,

1196
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,870
these different detection mechanisms.

1197
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,305
They're rich data from
things like GuardDuty,

1198
00:52:31,305 --> 00:52:33,330
from things like Inspector.

1199
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,410
Putting these things together,

1200
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,110
so folks can get closer to the end state

1201
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,180
of I know the data sitting in front of me,

1202
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,650
I have a decision to make,

1203
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,184
or it's already built on
my playbook hopefully,

1204
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:46,923
and I can now more easily
make those decisions.

1205
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,420
This ultimately will help
save you time, right?

1206
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,000
You're not needing to
do that triage yourself,

1207
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,610
not needing to do this
risk analysis yourself,

1208
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,870
getting closer to that.

1209
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,390
And then the other things
like simplified pricing

1210
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,130
and simplified deployment,

1211
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,190
making it even easier
to enable these services

1212
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,720
to operationalize these services,

1213
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,330
get them approved at your organizations,

1214
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,910
making it overall easier
to get these detection

1215
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:14,643
and response outcomes out
of AWS native services.

1216
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,680
So I'm gonna take a moment to talk

1217
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,680
about Security Hub plus OCSF.

1218
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,690
If you're not too familiar with OCSF,

1219
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,140
this is the open cybersecurity
schema framework.

1220
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,280
So it's a data standardization
for different log

1221
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,900
and finding data.

1222
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,110
This is an open source
solution that got open sourced

1223
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:41,850
in, I believe it was 2002 or 2022,

1224
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,150
and it actually joined the
Linux Foundation in 2024.

1225
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,480
There's over a thousand
participating organizations,

1226
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,430
AWS being a major contributor to this,

1227
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,230
but a number of different vendors

1228
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,480
that I'm sure you all
are very familiar with.

1229
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,080
But all of these security findings,

1230
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,340
these exposure-based findings,

1231
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,630
the findings that we're ingesting

1232
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,700
from the underlying detection services,

1233
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,380
these are all in OCSF format.

1234
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,660
So when you're potentially integrating

1235
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,250
with a response solution
or some analytics solution,

1236
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,660
you have standardized findings to get you

1237
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:18,480
into analytics a little bit easier.

1238
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,130
So like, whether it's a vulnerability,

1239
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,920
whether it's a threat,
the different fields

1240
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,350
are gonna be the same, the
different data sources,

1241
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,480
or it's already understood.

1242
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,730
And, you know, ultimately,
working with a bunch

1243
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,040
of the different vendors
that you might be using,

1244
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,463
using the same standard format
can help streamline that.

1245
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,700
So like I touched on one simplified bill,

1246
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,230
we wanted to make the
billing process much easier.

1247
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,580
Predictable pricing, cost
estimations, a single invoice,

1248
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,783
you're not doing this across services,

1249
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:56,070
and just simplifying,
you know, oftentimes,

1250
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,150
for security professionals,

1251
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,130
like we don't wanna
handle the billing stuff.

1252
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,097
We want to focus on the security stuff.

1253
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,060
And so we want to get you to focus

1254
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,590
on the security stuff faster

1255
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,183
and less focus on the billing.

1256
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,490
Go through this real quick.

1257
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,610
The number of services
that we've talked about,

1258
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,937
we've mainly focused on the GuardDuty,

1259
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,240
Inspector, and Security Hub.

1260
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,720
There's other pieces
of this puzzle, right?

1261
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,200
Macie for sensitive data discovery.

1262
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,140
You can feed your data
into Amazon Security Lake

1263
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,970
or the newly launched at
Matt's keynote yesterday,

1264
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,030
the CloudWatch unified store.

1265
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,590
This also in integrates

1266
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:39,090
with investigation functionality
in Amazon Detective,

1267
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:41,580
as well as AWS Security Incident Response,

1268
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,880
which we'll touch on
real quickly in a second.

1269
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,960
So AWS Security Incident
Response, if you're not aware,

1270
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,960
this is a service that is in the console.

1271
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,370
It combines a couple different things.

1272
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,180
It helps customers
prepare, respond to faster,

1273
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,590
and more effectively respond

1274
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,660
to these different security events.

1275
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,390
It combines different triaging technology

1276
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,720
behind the scenes to bring in
a bunch of findings together.

1277
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,180
And as well as human expertise

1278
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,610
from our customer incident response team

1279
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,030
that Ryan touched on earlier.

1280
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,250
And ultimately gives
customers direct access

1281
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,800
to a security professional 24/7

1282
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,230
that will look at the
output of that triaging

1283
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,510
and help customers respond to

1284
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,210
and recover from any
sort of security issue

1285
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,560
that they might be having
in their environment.

1286
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,360
One thing that we launched
earlier this week too

1287
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,440
is the ability to that
this is actually part

1288
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,490
of enterprise support.

1289
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,440
So if you're an enterprise
support customer,

1290
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,910
you can turn this on
with no additional cost

1291
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,290
to get these added benefits.

1292
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,870
So something you should look into.

1293
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,770
It takes pretty minimal
configuration to get up and going.

1294
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,290
If you're not an enterprise
support customer,

1295
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,690
there is metered pricing and a free tier

1296
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,273
that you can take advantage
of for this as well.

1297
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:08,280
Another big launch in the
Security Incident Response service

1298
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,133
was an ag agentic
AI-powered investigation.

1299
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:17,150
So this is bringing an agent
experience into this console.

1300
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,490
So right now, there's a triaging system

1301
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,137
that whittles down different
findings to say, like,

1302
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:25,911
"Here's the one that you
should prioritize based

1303
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:27,270
on some different factors associated

1304
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,607
with an individual
customer's environment."

1305
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,030
But then there's investigation steps.

1306
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:38,010
What other IPs did this
EC2 instance interact with?

1307
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,960
What other CloudTrail data was associated

1308
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,120
with this IAM role during this time,

1309
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,230
maybe the seven days before.

1310
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,913
Like there's other
questions that you'd want

1311
00:57:45,913 --> 00:57:47,670
to answer based on this
finding information.

1312
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,280
That agent does a lot of that work based

1313
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,070
on some pre-training and the expertise

1314
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,500
that the customer incident response team

1315
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,180
has built up over the years.

1316
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,810
So that when the human, on the AWS side,

1317
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,750
the security professional
and your team get together,

1318
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,340
there's already a number of the steps

1319
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,070
that used to be a human manually doing,

1320
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,240
they're already completed.

1321
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,010
So now we can have the discussion faster,

1322
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,870
we can get to the end stage faster.

1323
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,810
What are the decisions we
need to make for response?

1324
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,410
What do we need to go remediate?

1325
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,263
A couple other things,
HITRUST certification,

1326
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:28,550
some ticketing with ServiceNow
and Jira direct integrations.

1327
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,890
And then we also made
it to where customers

1328
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:34,740
could not only deploy this
across their organization,

1329
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,210
maybe they only needed it associated

1330
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,240
with one OU or a specific account,

1331
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,310
or they needed a combination of both.

1332
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:45,270
And so we made it easier
for customers to do that

1333
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,753
from a picking and choosing
where they want to deploy.

1334
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,830
So with that said, I wanna
say thank you, everybody,

1335
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,153
for coming to this.
