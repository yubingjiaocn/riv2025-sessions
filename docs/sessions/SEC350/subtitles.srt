1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
- Hello, good morning.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,820
And thank you for
joining for this session.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,450
I hope you all are having a lovely day too

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,460
and are already raking up a lot of steps,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,160
walking through the maze
that this conference is,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,290
but I hope that you continue to have fun

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,810
and a lot of learning
for the rest of the week.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,160
My name is Sujay Doshi

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,910
and I'm a senior product
manager with Amazon GuardDuty.

10
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:27,054
I'll be completing four
years this February,

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,663
and I'm joined today
by Peter and Mikaelly.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,157
- Hi, Peter Ferrie.

13
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:37,170
I've been with Amazon for
five and a half years.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,420
And this year is my 40th year

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,753
in doing anti-malware research.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,950
- Thank you, I'm Mikaelly.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,560
I'm in Nubank in almost three years

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,263
and I'm working as a
senior security engineer.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,240
- All right, thank you.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,390
So quick agenda, we'll start
with giving a short overview

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,070
of what the service is.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,460
Just raise of hands on how
many of you today use GuardDuty

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,050
and more specifically

24
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,093
one of the malware protection offerings.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,823
All right, okay, that's good.

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,180
Next we'll talk about the new
features that we launched,

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,080
a couple of new features that
we launched a few weeks ago.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,240
One is a scan on-demand API

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,550
and the other is a fully managed offering

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,670
to scan your AWS Backups from malware.

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,690
Next, we'll use Peter's
extensive experience,

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,950
and then for the first time,

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,790
he'll actually dive deep
into the inner workings

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,300
of the GuardDuty malware scan engine

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,653
and essentially how we keep up

36
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,950
with the ever-evolving malware landscape.

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,860
And then, we'll have Mikaelly share

38
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,520
on how they use one of the offerings

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,040
or couple of the offerings
from malware protection

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,093
from GuardDuty to drive their
security outcomes at Nubank.

41
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,970
So GuardDuty, Amazon GuardDuty,

42
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,210
for the ones that do not know,

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,880
it's a native threat
detection service from AWS

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,500
trusted by 95% of our
top 2000 AWS customers

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,050
looking at data and consuming logs.

46
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,440
Essentially, GuardDuty for
across tens of thousands

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,440
of customers monitors hundreds
of millions of EC2 instances

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,610
and millions of S3 buckets

49
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,730
to essentially give
visibility into account

50
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,683
and resource level compromise.

51
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,760
The sophistication that it derives

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,510
is the accessibility to
native threat intelligence

53
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,640
that it collects from various
internal threat intel groups

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,430
and combining it with all the
different detection algorithms

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,800
that we use that threat intelligence

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,910
to detect sophisticated cloud threats.

57
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,750
One such example is with
a system called Mithra

58
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,100
that we run internally.

59
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,630
It's a domain reputation service.

60
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,240
It's a graph-based neural network database

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
that essentially monitors all
the DNS traffic across Amazon

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,200
for the last seven days

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
and curates a list of
malicious and benign domains,

64
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,870
a lot of the times, days, weeks, months,

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,200
sooner than a traditional
threat intel provider.

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,680
And the reason we are able to
do this is the accessibility

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,350
and the telemetry that we are looking at

68
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,330
to kind of build this intelligence.

69
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,850
Being a fully managed service

70
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,620
and being the first-party service,

71
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,200
automatically these IOCs in form of IPs,

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,870
domains and file hashes are consumed

73
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,420
by GuardDuty into the threat
intelligence platform,

74
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,730
that is then used to monitor
the customer workloads

75
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,000
and the network traffic
to detect those threats.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
The other example that we share here

77
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,570
would be a system called MadPot.

78
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,570
That's a globally distributed
system of threat sensors,

79
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,420
honeypots that's essentially
tracking the attacker behavior,

80
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,790
the tactics, the techniques
and the procedures,

81
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,910
which ultimately also provides us the IOCs

82
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,380
and the behavior to understand

83
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,280
on how the attackers are
targeting the whole of AWS cloud

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,330
that we can then leverage for
specific customer workloads

85
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,660
and then use it to generate findings.

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,580
And then from an elasticity perspective

87
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,710
or the auto-scaling aspect,

88
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,030
we are just sharing an anecdote

89
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,310
that this year during Prime Day,

90
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,270
which I hope a lot of
you were able to enjoy,

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,190
GuardDuty processed close to
9 trillion events in an hour,

92
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,790
goes on to show with the
49% increase year-over-year

93
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,730
on how automatically it will scale

94
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,553
with the data that it consumes.

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,450
With all this intelligence,

96
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,820
it essentially relies on the telemetry

97
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,910
and the sources that we
collect the data from.

98
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,020
When you think about GuardDuty

99
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,600
as an account that has enabled GuardDuty,

100
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,490
automatically will be monitoring

101
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,890
the cloud trend management
events and the VPC flow logs

102
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,260
and the DNS query logs
from your EC2 instances.

103
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,260
That's basically what we
call as foundational sources.

104
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,230
And then everything else that we have,

105
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,450
S3 data plane events, Lambda monitoring,

106
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,490
when we monitor the
Lambda function executions

107
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,080
for network threats, all of
this, in the runtime agent,

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,490
all of this essentially are what we call

109
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,900
as operating protection plans.

110
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
So as a delegated
administrator, you can decide

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,840
to enable it on specific
workloads where you pertain

112
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,580
that the threat activity would manifest

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,220
and you want to be protected against.

114
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,820
Once we collect all of this
data, and a key differentiator

115
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,220
from a fully managed
aspect perspective means

116
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,740
that US customers, you do not need

117
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,780
to do any source service
side configuration

118
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,910
and then collect the data
so that we can process it.

119
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,100
You don't need to, you know,

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,930
collect the data
specifically for GuardDuty.

121
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,800
It may be for any investigation
or compliance purposes,

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,073
but GuardDuty does not rely
on customer vended logs.

123
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:02,280
If you enable one feature

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,690
or multiple of these features,

125
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,230
we'll automatically pull the
data from a backend stream

126
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,510
so that you do not have
the cost of ownership

127
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,360
of collecting the data and then, you know,

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,570
shipping it to GuardDuty
so that we can process it.

129
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,330
And that's a key value proposition,

130
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,120
being the first-party in
a fully planned service.

131
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Once we have all of this data,

132
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,420
it goes to the analytics engine

133
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,430
that essentially comprises
of threat intelligence.

134
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,650
We talked about some heuristics-based

135
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,130
TTB detection algorithms,
and then we also learn

136
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,860
the normal behavior from these logs

137
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,100
to essentially generate ML-based
anomaly detection findings

138
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,750
that gives visibility from the perspective

139
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,640
of is it normal for the organization,

140
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,650
is it normal for this particular workload?

141
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,950
Does the communication happen from an ASL

142
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,280
that has bad reputation,
so on and so forth.

143
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,220
But the major focus of
this session would be

144
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,743
on malware scanning or malware detection.

145
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,931
Historically, when GuardDuty
was launched in 2017

146
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,830
and up until 2022,

147
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,830
we had all of these
different protection plans

148
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,420
or features which relied on
telemetry data or events.

149
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,500
But in 2022, for the first time,

150
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,560
we expanded to scan a particular resource

151
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,600
specifically here to detect malware.

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,980
So we'll talk about some of the offerings

153
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,810
for malware protection that we have.

154
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,400
Starting with in 2022, as I said,

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,190
we launched for the first
time malware protection

156
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,370
for EC2 that delivers
an agentless solution

157
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,210
to detect malware for your
EC2 and container workloads

158
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,730
that have been attached to EBS volume.

159
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,820
With a single click, and similar
to other features, right?

160
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,040
The ease of use and holistic coverage

161
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,860
across the organization remains paramount.

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,770
With a single click, you can
get malware protection coverage

163
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,230
for all your accounts and workloads.

164
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,270
The centralized monitoring,

165
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,340
so you'll have a delegated administrator

166
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,610
and the security teams can
essentially review the findings

167
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,640
with contextual data
around the malware family,

168
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,940
the source within the
scan engine that we use,

169
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,303
and we'll talk about that
later in the session.

170
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,010
A very big value proposition
here is that there's no agents.

171
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,210
So you don't have to update, manage,

172
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,570
install in order to
specifically detect malware.

173
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,400
The container awareness
brings in a key protection

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,200
against some of your
container deployments.

175
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,300
And if there's a malware that's installed,

176
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,860
prior to this feature,
customers had to essentially

177
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,860
take a snapshot of their volumes,

178
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,720
run it against whatever malware scanner

179
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,140
is at their disposal, and
then try to stitch it back

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,810
to a narrative around,
if you saw in GuardDuty,

181
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,310
a network anomaly that indicates

182
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,740
that there's some
communication to C2 server,

183
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,470
what would a customer want to do, right?

184
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,490
They'll take a snapshot,

185
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,470
they'll check whether that's malware

186
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,570
or whether a malware was
installed as a result

187
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,580
of this network communication.

188
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,530
But all of that with this feature

189
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,270
was automated with a single click.

190
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,730
So customers who have enabled this feature

191
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,250
automatically will have
their EBS volume scanned

192
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,320
when we see a preceding network anomaly.

193
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,820
Or you can even use scan on-demand

194
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,080
as part of your investigation
or forensics workflow.

195
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,050
And then there's no performance impact

196
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,880
to your live workloads, 'cause again,

197
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,730
there's no agents that are installed.

198
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,830
Next we expanded the offering to provide

199
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,000
a fully managed solution to
secure the data pipelines

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,060
that you build on S3,
specifically helping to solve

201
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,240
for untrusted upload
application use cases.

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,670
You have external vendors
that's uploading data

203
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,700
or you have internal users
that's uploading data to S3.

204
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,840
In both this scenarios,

205
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,650
you did not first want to
be the receiver of something

206
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,300
that's malicious so that
you want to establish

207
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,950
a trustworthiness in the data
that's uploaded to your S3.

208
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,030
And also in the second case,

209
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,800
you do not want your internal users

210
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,770
through some later
supply chain compromise,

211
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,940
in the event that they're uploading,

212
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,737
let's say, an image file,
it's actually not a malware

213
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,290
and you do not want to be
a distributor of malware.

214
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,460
In both these cases, there's
a massive need to ensure

215
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,200
that there's trustworthiness in the data

216
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,516
and you can trust the prominence

217
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,270
of the data that's being sent.

218
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,500
With this feature on the buckets,

219
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,710
you can configure the
malware protection plan,

220
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,360
and we'll automatically monitor

221
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,060
for any new objects that are uploaded.

222
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,440
We'll scan them, we'll detect

223
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,333
if it's a malware generative finding,

224
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:33,660
using EventBridge, there'll
be scan notification

225
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,830
that you can consume

226
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,960
either in the delegated
administrator account

227
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,930
or your bucket owner
or the member accounts.

228
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,140
But once we also complete the scan,

229
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,650
we'll attach a tag on the object itself

230
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,680
so that you can implement
inherent protection

231
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,860
and quarantine use cases.

232
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,870
Using tag-based access control

233
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,450
in the bucket policy, you
can ensure that no user

234
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,960
of the application can
access this particular object

235
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,760
until and unless you find a
tag that's clean, let's say.

236
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,470
The scan engine, and
again, we'll dive deeper

237
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,170
into what all comprises
within the scan engine,

238
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,630
but that's automatically updated

239
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,280
to keep up with the signatures
and detection definitions

240
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,860
that we'll be using to detect malware.

241
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,570
So as a customer, you don't need

242
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,210
to manage the infrastructure.

243
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,580
There's no management of
updating the scan engine

244
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,040
to keep up with the latest
and the greatest threats.

245
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,450
And all of it is managed

246
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,520
on your behalf through this feature

247
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,120
and the seamless setup with
your minimal configuration

248
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,010
on the buckets that you want to protect

249
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,960
from unprecedented upload applications.

250
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,110
Few weeks ago, we expanded
the same offering.

251
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,400
Everything's the same

252
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,620
from a scan infrastructure perspective.

253
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,390
You do not need to manage, again,

254
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,150
no infrastructure, no scan engine updates.

255
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,840
But we added another pattern
essentially to ensure

256
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,410
that you not only scan any new
object uploads for malware,

257
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,010
but you can decide to
even scan existing objects

258
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,650
within an S3 bucket to
actually detect malware.

259
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,950
And you can seamlessly
integrate into your workflows

260
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,780
using the API to ensure

261
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,380
that even for the optics
that are already existing,

262
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,900
you can establish a security
baseline for the buckets

263
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,120
that are, let's say, not newly set up.

264
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,520
And a hybrid strategy

265
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
of combining continuous monitoring

266
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,690
through new object upload scanning

267
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,150
and then retro scanning through objects

268
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,920
that are already present in your S3 bucket

269
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,900
to ensure that you have the latest

270
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,320
and the greatest security
baseline for the buckets

271
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,683
that's in that untrusted upload realm.

272
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,150
And again, the orchestration layer,

273
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,830
you can use the API depending

274
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,750
on what the operating procedures are

275
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,253
and the workflow entails.

276
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,700
A major focus of this session

277
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,360
for the remaining part of
at least my talk would be

278
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,440
to introduce the fully managed offering

279
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,470
that we expanded in GuardDuty
malware protection suite

280
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,340
of offerings, is to scan the backups taken

281
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,290
by AWS Backup for malware.

282
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,330
We launched this a few weeks ago,

283
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,830
and this is where from
the AWS Backup console,

284
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,030
as part of your backup plan,

285
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,950
you can ensure continuous monitoring

286
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,710
for malware once a backup job completes.

287
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,710
We'll scan your EBS backups
or snapshots, your EC2 AMIs

288
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,320
and your S3 recovery points
automatically for malware

289
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,060
once you set up that configuration

290
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,220
as part of your backup plan.

291
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,830
You can also use on-demand scanning

292
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,870
and investigate your past backups,

293
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,223
very specifically useful for
safe restoration workflows.

294
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,380
In addition to the
scanning, we have two modes

295
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,230
that are available, full and incremental.

296
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,690
Incremental scanning here
provides cost efficiency

297
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,690
wherein will only scan for the data

298
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,610
that's changed between a
backup that I took yesterday

299
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,490
and the backup that I'm scanning today.

300
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,970
So you don't end up paying
for the entire scan always,

301
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,560
but then the full scan

302
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,250
is where you add more security assurance,

303
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,620
and it's something that
you would want to ensure

304
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,200
that you're safely restoring always

305
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,110
with the latest
verification from the latest

306
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,070
and the greatest malware
detection definitions.

307
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,480
So the full scan gives
you that opportunity.

308
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,170
And again, the idea is
it does not involve you

309
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,380
as part of the backup processes.

310
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,180
So the backup jobs, once they are complete

311
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,250
is when the scan initiates,

312
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,530
and there's minimal configuration

313
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,720
that you have to do either on GuardDuty

314
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,843
or backup to realize this feature.

315
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,400
And this eliminates the need
for you to do manual scan

316
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,770
and restore workflows,
which are time-consuming,

317
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,110
delays the business recovery

318
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,630
in cases on events like ransomware

319
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,780
and provides you a seamless integration

320
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,933
between these two kind
of native AWS services.

321
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,870
But you might ask

322
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,640
on why would you scan
backup resources for malware

323
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,520
if you're already scanning
the live workloads

324
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,250
either through traditional EDR tools

325
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,380
or using one of the
offerings from GuardDuty

326
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,180
that we talked for EBS volume scanning

327
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,073
and your S3 object scanning?

328
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,650
And to understand this,

329
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,870
we'll try to look at a scenario

330
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,170
on how a malware progresses
through a backup.

331
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,920
And this timeline is a typical
14-day retention timeline

332
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,920
wherein each block
represents a daily backup.

333
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,573
So as you can see in the first phase,

334
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,353
which is the green phase,
from day one to seven,

335
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,770
we see that the attacker
already has a foothold

336
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,733
in the environment.

337
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,560
But again, the malware was planted,

338
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,170
but it's dormant, it's
not yet activated, right?

339
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,260
We don't see any system changes,

340
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,700
there's no files that are impacted.

341
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,080
We don't see encryption,

342
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,240
or there's no malicious artifacts

343
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,330
that got introduced in day one to seven.

344
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,320
Also, the dormancy of the malware ensures

345
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,730
that there's no persistence that's created

346
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,740
and it's just specific malware files

347
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,423
that are present, but
they're not yet acting upon.

348
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,930
Also the reason we call these
backups as clean backups

349
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,660
is in a typical restoration workflow,

350
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,910
you'll restore, you'll always restore

351
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,520
or you want to restore in a
clean and isolated environment.

352
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,220
What that does is it
actually, in many cases,

353
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,400
negates the effect of the malware,

354
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,680
which is environment dependent, right?

355
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,300
And it also blocks the C2
communication pathways.

356
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,620
So all in all, this represents
the safe recovery period

357
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,260
and also a point in time
before malicious behavior

358
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,360
is surfaced in the environment.

359
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,080
The second phase is the
yellow phase, day 8 to 10,

360
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,910
where we start seeing early
stage artifacts appearing

361
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,930
in the environment.

362
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,550
This might be small preparatory changes

363
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,550
but are still low noise that
in environment, EDR tools

364
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,830
or live scanning workload solutions,

365
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,470
will actually not have
noticeable indicators

366
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,150
that are generated 'cause of the low noise

367
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,943
and still the dormancy of the malware.

368
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,760
But all of these, once
the malware's activated,

369
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,340
actually that slips past into the backups.

370
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,860
You can still do some surgical
fixes from these malware

371
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,880
and restore just the
critical business data.

372
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,090
But that is where you
still need to perform

373
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,890
the item level recovery capability

374
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,310
that AWS Backup inherently
provides, ensuring that

375
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,673
you are restoring just the
clean portion of these backups.

376
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,050
And day 11 to 14 represents

377
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,560
where we see ransomware event happen.

378
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,580
So the entire production system
and even your new backups

379
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,800
that are taken are
actually all compromised,

380
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,500
and it's unsafe to restore
from these backups.

381
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,280
If you think about this
timeline in a real environment,

382
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,570
the timing spans across multiple weeks.

383
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,370
For an example, if the initial compromise

384
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,430
that we talked about
happened three weeks ago,

385
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,400
your last clean backup that you know of

386
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,470
was taken two weeks ago.

387
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,840
The activation happens now.

388
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,900
So imagine that by the
time the team identifies

389
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,050
that there's a breach
in their environment,

390
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,900
it might be too late because
of the retention window

391
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,360
that you typically would have
configured for your backups

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,960
and you start losing on the clean backups.

393
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,010
Imagine if you identify the
breach one week from now,

394
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,570
you're basically losing out

395
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,640
on the entire safe recovery window

396
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,440
or the backups that are identified

397
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,630
and tagged as clean backups.

398
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,950
So the key takeaway here

399
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,210
is proactive preservation
of the clean backups,

400
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,820
but more importantly, identification

401
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,430
that you have a clean
or an infected backup

402
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,650
to ensure that your recovery process

403
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,290
in the event of events like ransomware,

404
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,073
you can safely recover
always from a clean copy.

405
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,910
So this progression actually highlights

406
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,260
a natural blind spot and
the early stage threats

407
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,260
that slip past into the
backups but are not detected

408
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,310
by live workload scanning solutions

409
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,180
like GuardDuty, EBS
scanning or S3 scanning,

410
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,700
or even your traditional EDR tools,

411
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,350
'cause they are not designed

412
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,960
to actually detect some of
these dormant behaviors.

413
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,520
They'll be monitoring the in
environment running workloads.

414
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,160
And then we look at the
behavior in many cases

415
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,883
to find something malicious has happened.

416
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,790
And if the threat is dormant,

417
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,620
which in our example was the case,

418
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,553
these threats will slip
past into the backup.

419
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,720
Automatic backup scanning
essentially solves

420
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,990
or addresses this by continuously scanning

421
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,830
the backup data addressed
into the backup repositories,

422
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,240
abstracting vault level constructs,

423
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,980
so that it automatically,
once the backup job completes,

424
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,330
will initiate the scan.

425
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,670
And it continuously tracks the changes

426
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,650
that happens to your backups

427
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,230
and identifying from when a backup moved

428
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,230
from clean state to unsafe
to actually compromised.

429
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,970
And then you can define
the last known clean backup

430
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,393
is what you want to restore
from in the event of ransomware.

431
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,830
Also, the traditional recovery
solutions actually rely

432
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,220
on manual restore and
scan, which is again,

433
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,660
as we identified, is
time-consuming, adds cost overhead

434
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,910
and delays essentially
the business recovery.

435
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,930
So automatic scanning through this feature

436
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,630
basically solves for these efficiencies

437
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,250
and will continuously provide assurance

438
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,653
of the presence of malware
as the backups are taken.

439
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,150
All in all, bringing this together,

440
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,330
backup scanning essentially
provides a second layer

441
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,150
of defense to your
traditional malware scanning

442
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,680
for live workload solutions.

443
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,200
And hence, they are
more like complementary

444
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,210
and not competing solutions,

445
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,250
which are two essential security layers

446
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,133
in the entire data protection life cycle.

447
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,500
Quickly, we'll look into, you know,

448
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,170
the importance of periodic full scan

449
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:00,010
and how you want to ensure
that while cost efficiency

450
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,480
is a major factor with
incremental scanning,

451
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,050
but time and again, and
especially for safe restoration,

452
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,400
how full scan and more
specifically periodic full scans

453
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,840
are important, right?

454
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,150
So imagine the first full scan happens

455
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,640
on the day one when the backup runs.

456
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,360
So day one to four,
after the first backup,

457
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,640
there's incremental scan,
and we'll continue to scan

458
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,700
just the data that changed
between these days.

459
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,040
Let's say a malware, a
zero-day malware was planted

460
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,040
on day four, but GuardDuty,
because at that point,

461
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,080
the detection definitions
did not have information

462
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,220
about that threat.

463
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,890
So what we'll do, when we
will do incremental scan,

464
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,020
we'll actually tag it as no threats found.

465
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,330
Even though the threat
exists in the backup,

466
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,023
when we scan that data,

467
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:50,040
because we didn't have
the detection definitions,

468
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,873
we'll tag it as no threats.

469
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,180
So now let's say after the fifth day

470
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,610
is when the malware engine was updated

471
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,603
and we now have that information
of the zero-day malware.

472
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,010
But if you continue to
just run incremental scans,

473
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,360
because it only scans the data

474
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,080
that's different from the past
day, we'll actually continue

475
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,080
to attach the wrong disposition
to subsequent backups

476
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,910
and we'll continue to tag
them as no threats found.

477
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,770
So where periodic full
scans come into play,

478
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,907
for the same scenario on the day six

479
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,500
when we identify that
there is no threats found,

480
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,160
let's say on day seven, you
actually ran a full scan.

481
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,560
Now because you already
have the information

482
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,240
with the latest detection definition

483
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,630
and also the definition
for the zero-day malware,

484
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,910
we'll actually attach
the right disposition.

485
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,930
We'll say that backup
seven, it has threats

486
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,480
and we'll also maintain the lineage

487
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,670
of all the backups attached,

488
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,260
or the parent backup from within,

489
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,790
we continue to take incremental backups.

490
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,480
So once you rebased the baseline
through periodic full scan,

491
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,710
when we do an incremental
scan on the eighth day,

492
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,190
even though there's no
new file that was added,

493
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,700
which was actually malicious,
we carried forward the status.

494
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,897
So tomorrow, if you
decide to actually restore

495
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,460
from eighth day backup, you
will have the information

496
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,620
that in the lineage, there was a backup

497
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,420
that was either the same backup

498
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,690
or the backup in the lineage has malware.

499
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,680
So once you remove that malicious file

500
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,520
from the backup source,
subsequent incremental scan

501
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,980
automatically will re-base the status.

502
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,170
So now what this provides is

503
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,170
is it maintains the
information and the history of,

504
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,420
through incremental scans,
it will maintain the history

505
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,880
of what files that were
detected as malware,

506
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,650
are they still malicious?

507
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,960
And if they are, we continue
to carry forward the status.

508
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,090
And if we don't find that malicious file

509
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,270
and everything is clean,
we'll update the status

510
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,480
so customers can use
the subsequent backups

511
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,030
or the last known clean backup.

512
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,220
This is the importance
of periodic scanning

513
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,013
to ensure assurance every
time you wanna restore.

514
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,583
A sample implementation workflow.

515
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,110
Think about using GuardDuty,
you get to the point

516
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,830
where there's an outcome
in form of findings,

517
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,280
there is EventBridge notification.

518
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,640
You can use that and have
custom implementation

519
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,720
through a Lambda function later

520
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,130
that will tag the backups
and use SCP to ensure

521
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,680
that you are never restoring from a backup

522
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,090
that's tagged as infected.

523
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,680
On the other hand, for clean backups,

524
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,160
you can safely move them
to an isolated environment

525
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,530
to ensure that you always restore

526
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,160
from these isolated
logically air-gapped vaults

527
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,253
to make sure that the backups
you're restoring is safe.

528
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,950
How it looks on the console?

529
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,350
You simply provide a scanner rule

530
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,110
as part of your backup
plan, define which resources

531
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,370
you want to perform the
backup scanning for,

532
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,220
and then you select the
mode against the cadence

533
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,920
of daily, hourly, weekly, monthly.

534
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,400
And then the on-demand
scanning is exactly the same.

535
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,580
When you provide for
investigation on forensics,

536
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,250
you provide and you can
perform full on incremental,

537
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,370
but you provide the on
and we'll continue to scan

538
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,850
providing you have the right
permissions given in the rule.

539
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,030
And then on GuardDuty, you
can monitor the results.

540
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,120
Again, contextualization,
like any other finding

541
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,230
in GuardDuty, is paramount,

542
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,946
will give them malware source information,

543
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:42,240
the scan engine information,
so on and so forth.

544
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,580
And again, if you wanna restore

545
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,830
as part of your backup processes,

546
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,570
you go to the backup console

547
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,160
and then you look at the
backups that are clean.

548
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,240
And then you can define

549
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,740
to either run an on-demand scan view,

550
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,070
we actually recommend to
run an on-demand scan always

551
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,120
at the time you are restoring

552
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,870
so that it verifies against
the latest signature set

553
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,870
to give you the assurance that you need.

554
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,150
Pricing, straightforward pricing
for all the resource types.

555
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,413
That is EBS, S3 and EC2, $0.05 for the GB.

556
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,500
If you decide to do incremental scanning,

557
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,650
the first scan will
certainly be a full scan

558
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,730
so that we can then define

559
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,820
on the next time a backup
is run, what has changed.

560
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,400
But the first scan will be full

561
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,200
and then subsequent will be incremental

562
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,400
depending on your configuration.

563
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,020
And there's an example, for
100 GB volume, it'll be $5.

564
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,570
And then subsequently, if
there's only 2 GBs that changed,

565
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,340
you know, it'll be cost-efficient,

566
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,640
giving you kind of the same
results that you'd reach to

567
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,893
or outcomes you'd reach
to with full scans.

568
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,283
So some general best practices.

569
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,910
Automated incremental
scanning for cost efficiency,

570
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,183
periodic full scans for
re-base lining and assurance.

571
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,050
And like I said, in time
of security incidents

572
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,083
for restoration, on-demand
scan's always appreciated.

573
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,560
And you don't need to enable
foundational GuardDuty,

574
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,090
but we still recommend it, right?

575
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,320
Think of different solution

576
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,780
and findings that we have,
especially for resiliency

577
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,330
and recovery and ransomware detections,

578
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,970
which is not always based on files

579
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,130
but file list behavior
you see with, you know,

580
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,050
S3 data plane events where
we see a lot of encryption

581
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,310
through customer keys, or there's a spike,

582
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,586
a anomalous spike in, you know,

583
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:30,600
GetObject, ListObject kind of scenarios.

584
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,640
All of those signals and
findings are available

585
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,590
in GuardDuty through other features.

586
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,280
So even though foundational
guard, it is not paramount,

587
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,023
but we recommend it so
that you can combine it

588
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:42,990
with these signals to get
higher fidelity findings

589
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,913
around your ransomware events.

590
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,870
And with all the information

591
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,300
that's available in
findings and EventBridge,

592
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,010
both backup persona and security persona

593
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,410
get the relevant information
around the malware.

594
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,340
AlL right, I'd like to
invite Peter to talk

595
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,693
and dive deep into this.

596
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,210
- So GuardDuty has multiple
engines that it uses

597
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,183
to handle different detection scenarios.

598
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,533
The first engine we have
is a hash-based one,

599
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,650
and we use that engine primarily

600
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,630
to suppress false positives

601
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,233
so we can exclude the
one file and no others.

602
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,680
We also use this engine
for responding quickly.

603
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,970
For example, if there's an outbreak

604
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,210
and we can add detection very quickly,

605
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,243
and we can respond within
minutes instead of hours.

606
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,850
The engine itself is quite fast.

607
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,813
We found some ways to accelerate
our hashing operation.

608
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,590
And the engine itself is resilient

609
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,633
to minor changes in the file.

610
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,040
And what I mean by that is that typically,

611
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,040
we consider a file to be
a solid block of bytes,

612
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,040
and so hash just from end
to end to get a single hash.

613
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,180
But there can be cases where a file has a,

614
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,710
instead of being a solid block of bytes,

615
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,990
there might be some squishy
bit right in the middle.

616
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,113
It might have a URL or
username/password combination.

617
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,800
And in that case, our engine is differing

618
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,620
from the traditional implementation,

619
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,043
because it can be told to
hash around the variable part.

620
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,400
Similarly, if a file has content

621
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,680
at the end that is variable,

622
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,780
perhaps there's an appended configuration,

623
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,440
then our engine can be told
to hash up to the point

624
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,370
where the variable content starts,

625
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,190
which means that you can add
any number of additional bytes,

626
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,910
you can change any values
within the variable section

627
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,760
and we'll still have a constant hash.

628
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,630
So for the people that,
you know, bad actors

629
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,240
that are getting their
sites taken down quickly

630
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,603
and they keep cycling, we'll
still have detection for these.

631
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,120
The next engine we have is
a pattern matching engine.

632
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,250
In the event that hashing is not suitable

633
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:28,080
because there might be multiple
changes throughout the file,

634
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,900
or if a file is very, very large,

635
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,180
but the really interesting
part is right at the front,

636
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,023
then we'll use the pattern
matching engine for that.

637
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,390
The engine is very flexible,

638
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,780
it supports traditional
signature-based scanning,

639
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,360
just doing straight byte comparisons.

640
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,370
But we can do more than that.

641
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,960
We can perform conditional evaluations

642
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,973
up to a certain point in the file.

643
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,880
We can perform frequency analysis

644
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,520
of the bytes we've seen
up to a certain point,

645
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,550
and we can even extract
bit level characteristics

646
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,313
of the file for very fine
grain pattern matching.

647
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,870
The engine is very expressive,

648
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,330
so the intent of a detection

649
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,580
is very clear for the next engineer

650
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,760
who has to perhaps extend
an existing detection

651
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,950
or if they're the ones
having to do the code review

652
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,603
for an existing detection.

653
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,450
We use this engine primarily
for specific detections

654
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,443
where the code is constant
across replicants.

655
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,300
And here's an example from actual malware.

656
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,300
This code will execute arbitrary
commands received remotely

657
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,143
without any user interaction.

658
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,950
And for us, this quite a simple example.

659
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,950
It's a single detection,
but there also can be cases

660
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,350
where we wanna use the
engine for generic detections

661
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,350
where multiple variants of the same sample

662
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,763
differ only slightly, but
otherwise functionally equivalent.

663
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,180
Here's an example of an actual malware,

664
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,530
just a snippet of the code.

665
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,860
This malware uses a polymorphic engine

666
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,433
to change its appearance
from replicant to replicant.

667
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,980
And the engine is able to
insert random characters

668
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,970
in the decryptor body

669
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,393
and also change the variable
names to random strings.

670
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,600
Here's another example where you can see

671
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,723
the constant portions
are becoming smaller.

672
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,840
And here's the extreme example

673
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,700
where the constant
portions have been reduced

674
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,860
to the smallest possible length

675
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,120
and all the variable names

676
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,070
have been replaced with random strings.

677
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,400
And despite the difference
between the first example

678
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,930
and the last one, it's still
a single detection for us.

679
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,083
That gives a sense of just
how powerful this engine is.

680
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,380
The next engine we have is
a machine learning engine,

681
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,200
and our focus with machine learning

682
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,690
is cryptocurrency miners.

683
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,540
The reason for that is because
within our environment,

684
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,123
cryptocurrency miners are a big problem.

685
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,263
And you might be wondering
how big of a problem it is.

686
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,520
If we look at this table here, we can see

687
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,120
how quickly a cryptocurrency
miner can be installed.

688
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,510
We went from a misconfigured state

689
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,140
to a compromised state in less
than four and a half days,

690
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,040
which means that the
compromised instance was found

691
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,040
in its pristine state almost immediately

692
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,940
and the miner was installed
very, very quickly after that.

693
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:00,600
If we consider from a dynamic
analysis point of view,

694
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,330
over 60% of compromised workloads

695
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,650
involve cryptocurrency mining

696
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,023
as part of that post exploitation event.

697
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,390
And in fact, cryptocurrency mining

698
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,990
is the most common post
compromise activity

699
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,413
that we see in a dynamic
detection scenario.

700
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,730
But coming back to the static analysis,

701
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,730
I took one week's worth of scan
results that had detections.

702
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,960
Of those scan results,

703
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,010
I took 8,000 samples entirely randomly.

704
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,370
And of those 8,000 detections we had,

705
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,833
45% of them were cryptocurrency miners.

706
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,570
Now not all of those were unique,

707
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,050
but even if 90% of them were identical,

708
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,930
that still leaves over 300 unique samples

709
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,840
that someone would have to
add detection for manually

710
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,690
from this subset week-over-week,

711
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,453
if we were to do this one at a time.

712
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,990
So that's a huge problem.

713
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,173
But fortunately for us, we
have a machine learning model,

714
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,170
and I would love to say it's so awesome

715
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,390
that it detects all of these,

716
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,163
but it's not, at least not yet,

717
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,580
but still, it's doing some
very heavy lifting for us,

718
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,010
and for the ones that it doesn't detect,

719
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,930
we have our patent matching engine

720
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,130
and the hashing engine
to clean up the rest.

721
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,970
The next engine we have
is a third-party engine.

722
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,853
We receive this engine as
an SDK from the vendor,

723
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,120
and it runs as part of
our regular scan flow.

724
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,353
But we run this engine in an
entirely isolated instance.

725
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,010
It's not able to connect
with the cloud provider,

726
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,950
it's not able to connect
to the internet at all.

727
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,540
The only thing we get out of the instance

728
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,320
is the finding results, and
we are very careful about

729
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,290
what we will accept
from the finding results

730
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,963
to minimize the chance
of exfiltration of data.

731
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,830
We use this engine primarily
for historical detections,

732
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,190
because the vendor has seen many samples

733
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,050
that we might never see.

734
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,800
We don't automatically
collect samples from customers

735
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,680
and we don't share these
samples with the vendor.

736
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,590
So in the event that a
customer is not willing

737
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,330
to share a sample with us,

738
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,430
then we might never see the sample at all.

739
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:25,740
The SDK also offers heuristic detections,

740
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,100
and they use a machine learning
model for this as well.

741
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,280
We are working to develop
our own heuristics specific

742
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,160
to our environment, but at least for now,

743
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,510
these existing heuristics

744
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,403
are a very powerful baseline for us.

745
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,880
We also get passes in this
SDK for common file formats

746
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,703
such as archives, images and documents.

747
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,760
Again, we're working on
our own passes specific

748
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,463
to our environment to get
better scanning performance,

749
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,580
but we also have file formats

750
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,230
that the vendor might never see

751
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,450
because we don't share the samples.

752
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,173
And so we're working on
specific parsers for those two.

753
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,770
So that covers our static
detection for EC2 and S3.

754
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,840
And Mikaelly, my co-presenter,

755
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,240
will talk more about a
specific use case for S3,

756
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,551
but we have more than
just static scanning.

757
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,263
We also have a runtime service.

758
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,870
This runtime service runs on the instance.

759
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,700
It has system-wide
visibility into everything

760
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,250
that's happening as it happens.

761
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,680
We get file system and network events,

762
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,970
and there's also container aware,

763
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,783
so we can see inside AKS and ECS.

764
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,230
We collect events from
the system into signals

765
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,130
and a collection of signals
get correlated into a finding.

766
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,150
Here's an example of a finding

767
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,940
using our latest extended
threat detection,

768
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,180
which was presented at an
earlier talk this morning.

769
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,390
You can see the level of
detail that we have here.

770
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,933
We have a detection here
for a newly downloaded file.

771
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,710
There was a file system event
when the file was downloaded

772
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,623
that triggered a hash
calculation and a hash lookup.

773
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,950
The hash was found on our deny list

774
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,400
and resulted in this finding.

775
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,670
Here's what the findings
used to look like,

776
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,420
and you can see what we changed it.

777
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,860
If you squint to the
top right-hand corner,

778
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,643
you can see a reverse shell
was created on the system.

779
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,963
We have file system events
when the file was created.

780
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,370
We had the system event when
the process was started,

781
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,780
and we have the network events
when the process connected

782
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,690
to the website and when it
redirected the standard IO

783
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,230
to point to particular port on the system.

784
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,113
And that collection of events
resulted in this finding.

785
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,690
Here we have another detection for a site

786
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,273
that tried to connect to
a cryptocurrency website.

787
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,950
And the network event that was intercepted

788
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,490
when the process attempted
to connect to the site

789
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,140
is what resulted in this finding.

790
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,660
But for customers that don't want to run

791
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,570
a runtime service on their instance,

792
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,230
we have a network level scanning as well.

793
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,760
And this is not relying
on explicit scanning,

794
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,983
it is just monitoring the
activity as it happens.

795
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,190
The network scanning is able to watch

796
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,890
for network connections to
sites with poor reputation.

797
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,620
It's able to detect credential use

798
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,573
in anomalous configurations,

799
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,510
and it's also looking for data access

800
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,690
that is not within the
typical behavior patterns

801
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,523
on the system.

802
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,520
Used an example of a finding
where a instance tried

803
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,013
to connect to a cryptocurrency website.

804
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,570
Used an example of a finding
where an instance tried

805
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,823
to connect to a command
and control website.

806
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,160
And finally, here is a finding

807
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,210
where an IP address that's
on our deny list attempted

808
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,350
to call an API that is
commonly used just prior

809
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,303
to an exploitation attempt.

810
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,540
This shows how all of
our engines work together

811
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,010
to protect customers

812
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,403
and that's how we keep up
with the threat landscape.

813
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,310
And now I'll pass to Mikaelly

814
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,473
who can describe a
specific use case for S3.

815
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,223
- Thank you, Pete.

816
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,740
So I'm from Nubank's cloud security team,

817
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,300
and I'm gonna present use case from EC2

818
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,073
and history of GuardDuty's malware module.

819
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,873
But before this, let me
start introducing us to you.

820
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,670
Nubank was born from the discomfort

821
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,630
and the powerless feeling while dealing

822
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,350
with bureaucracy in financial services.

823
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:39,350
We started in 2013 in Brazil with a goal

824
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,670
of simplifying people's lives

825
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,163
and empowering them financially.

826
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,090
Since 2013 to today, we went
from a credit card issuer

827
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,643
to the most valuable brand in the country.

828
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,300
Seeing how successful we were,

829
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,960
we begin to search another markets,

830
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,280
and seeing how similar
problems Latin America have,

831
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,460
we started that, and now we have presence

832
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,460
in three countries in
Mexico, Columbia, in Brazil.

833
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:21,770
We surpass our 100 million clients goal,

834
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:26,610
and we still managed to have a metric

835
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,670
of customer-centered philosophy

836
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,670
to have less than $1 cost
to serve each client.

837
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,160
About the challenge they
are gonna present here.

838
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,440
As Nubank was scaling

839
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,150
and adding more financial
products in more countries,

840
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,150
we begin to have a
problem with rapid growth

841
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,370
and also different (speaks indistinctly)

842
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,163
with specific countries.

843
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,270
And this year, we had the opportunity

844
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,810
to have a single process for PCI,

845
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,193
because it's basically
the same in each country.

846
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,853
The main point about the PCI

847
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:22,470
that I'm going to present here
is about malware detection,

848
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:26,760
and not only about the requirements

849
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,770
that we were gonna attend,

850
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,220
we also had the company's requirements.

851
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,240
Our security team don't have to impact

852
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,003
or add friction to growth.

853
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,610
So we were searching a tool

854
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:49,610
that could be effortless
to integrate in our system,

855
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,020
and GuardDuty was the smoothest

856
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,103
and most integrated with our environment.

857
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,410
To begin the implementation strategy,

858
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,820
I have a main point to present here,

859
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,020
is Nubank, in Nubank,
we treat each country

860
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,633
as a single organization in AWS.

861
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,180
So if we're gonna do the configuration

862
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,840
of GuardDuty on AWS organizations,

863
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,220
we would have administration
points for each country.

864
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,390
And as a global team, it's simpler

865
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:35,390
to go into with a
invitation-based implementation.

866
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,080
It showed on the step three.

867
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,520
But in practice, we have the accounts

868
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,960
with the resource in the original place.

869
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,773
And going further to our
administration point.

870
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,390
For the monitoring of
findings, we have a dual path.

871
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,520
As a cloud security team,

872
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,020
we have to enable things
from other security teams

873
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,663
and have this monitoring constantly.

874
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:15,000
The main path and the official path

875
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,650
for the certain SOC teams
for incident response

876
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,580
is the one that goes through a bucket

877
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,020
and feeds our CM so they can interact.

878
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,020
And the other path serves
up our purpose of visibility

879
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,760
and also that we can be promptly ready

880
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,790
to have any assistance
for the security teams

881
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,873
and the production teams
invited in the incident.

882
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,440
Beyond the implementation
of the detection,

883
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,440
we also managed to get ready
specifically for history.

884
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,280
The whole process automated
with a first response

885
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,050
where we can be a tech-based pipeline.

886
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:12,050
Once GuardDuty tags a S3 object,

887
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,500
we manage to have a restrictive policy.

888
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,060
So only SOC teams have
interacting with the file

889
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,313
and have the analysis.

890
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:28,800
If they matched false positives,

891
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,643
they also update and the
access is head storage.

892
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,600
For the EC2, we went from a
more conservative approach,

893
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,630
because in automated first
response could lead to outage.

894
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,170
So we made available the
isolation in the playbook,

895
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,720
but it's only applied once the team

896
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,363
is involved in the incident.

897
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,580
So to finalize our use of GuardDuty,

898
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:10,023
what we begin with regulated request,

899
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,420
we managed to revise our process

900
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,210
of malware analysis in Nubank

901
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,973
and also improve the process.

902
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,800
Because we use GuardDuty

903
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,250
in our already integrated environment,

904
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,880
we cause no disruption
to productive teams.

905
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,880
We didn't break anything
and it was very seamless.

906
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,460
We also achieve a global compliance,

907
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,460
and we can rollout to any
country that we intend to.

908
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,450
This changed completely
our coverage in the cloud

909
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,993
because we didn't have this two history.

910
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,250
And also by enabling this,

911
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,340
we managed to get to productive teams.

912
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:07,110
A new feature, they can autonomous enable

913
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:12,110
a document triage for third-party
files and be more secure.

914
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,170
The whole process was revised

915
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:21,170
and enabled in less than two months,

916
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,020
and we still manage to
maintain the cost less than $1

917
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,323
to serve each account.

918
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,507
So welcome back.

919
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:33,693
Sujay, finalize.

920
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,630
- Thanks, Mikaelly.

921
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,000
All right, so some key takeaways

922
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,920
from this session that we learned.

923
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,730
The fully-managed aspect
reduces the cost of ownership

924
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:49,140
for you to detect threats from
malware in your workloads,

925
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,320
and more specifically aiding
in ransomware scenarios

926
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,123
with the recently launched feature.

927
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,850
And again, put live workloads

928
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,280
and you can combine now
with backup scanning,

929
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,520
or for backup workloads
with a single scan engine

930
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,930
that kind of learns from all
of these different offerings

931
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,390
to collectively provide higher efficacy

932
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,673
and higher fidelity to
malware-based threats.

933
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,970
And it compliments, as
Peter walked us through,

934
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,600
it compliments other offerings
from GuardDuty by combining

935
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,870
and correlating to
actually provide visibility

936
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,050
into the actual breed scenario,

937
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,473
pre-exploitation, compromise
and post-exploitation.

938
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,030
And this improves security operations

939
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,220
with contextual information
around the resources,

940
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,580
the malware family, the
scan engine that contributed

941
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,030
and the attacker information.

942
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,763
And that's it.

943
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,530
Thank you for attending this session.

944
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,630
I'd like to invite the fellow speakers to.
