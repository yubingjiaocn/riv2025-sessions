1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,649
Uh, just to make sure you're in the right place, uh,

2
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:05,429
we're gonna be talking Apache Iceberg,

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,889
and we're gonna walk through what Warner Music

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,390
Group has been doing with it.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,489
I will kick us off. Uh, my

6
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:14,778
name's William Rashon. I'm the

7
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:17,000
industry principal for the media and entertainment

8
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:18,879
category at Snowflake.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,079
Um, I have

10
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,818
Michael Jones with me, uh, who's gonna

11
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:25,339
share a case study and deep dive

12
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,059
on

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,059
how they're using Iceberg and the

14
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:30,679
impacts it's having at the business.

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,219
Uh, before we do that, I

16
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,560
will give a little background on Iceberg.

17
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,779
Um, I'm assuming a lot of people because

18
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:40,020
you've came here have some familiarity with it.

19
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,649
Uh, but, uh, we'll do a quick

20
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,429
backgrounder on what Iceberg is,

21
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:46,630
where it came from,

22
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:49,429
and then some, uh, best practices

23
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,539
that we see in the, uh,

24
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,829
media industry and how customers

25
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:54,859
are leveraging it,

26
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:57,408
and, uh, we'll share, you know, some

27
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,609
statistics on, uh, kind of the

28
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,889
pace of innovation that we've seen on it as well.

29
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,319
Uh, so with that, uh, just to level

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,519
set on what is Iceberg,

31
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,778
uh, where does it fit into the picture,

32
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,049
uh, in a technology landscape,

33
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,000
uh, so it's a data lake

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,959
table format,

35
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:18,418
uh, it's a layer of abstraction

36
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:20,519
for various query engines that,

37
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,980
uh, clients might be using.

38
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,609
Uh, the things that we hear

39
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,760
from customers and what we see is that,

40
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:29,489
you know, really enables them to,

41
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:31,069
uh, open up their data,

42
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,329
uh, wherever it sits, uh, to be

43
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,329
able to have a consistent way to access all of

44
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,448
that, uh, so you get

45
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:39,448
a lot of the benefits that you might see from

46
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:41,454
using a data platform. Like Snowflake when

47
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,433
it comes to governance, performance,

48
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:45,674
uh, ease of management,

49
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:48,775
uh, and you have that unified layer

50
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,355
across all the data sources,

51
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,734
um, when it comes to, uh, a

52
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,855
format like Iceberg, uh, what

53
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:56,995
we see is that, you know what you're looking

54
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,674
for is consistency,

55
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,153
uh, you're looking for the ability to,

56
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,213
uh, have all the teams access the

57
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,073
same data

58
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:06,415
and have the ability to go back in

59
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,534
time and review the data and how it's changed

60
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:09,153
as well.

61
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,308
Uh, so the, the big features that we see,

62
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,429
you know, what are the things that, uh, clients

63
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,508
are getting out of Iceberg and why are they using

64
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,868
it, uh, so it's the partition

65
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,069
evolution, it's, uh, the hidden

66
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,500
partitioning, uh, asset compliance,

67
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:26,149
time travel, and then, uh, flexibility

68
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:28,379
are kind of the, the core, uh,

69
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,429
features that a lot of our clients get value

70
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,429
out of when it comes to Apache Iceberg.

71
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:34,349
Um,

72
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,610
we've heard, uh, a lot of feedback from

73
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,808
customers too that, you know, they, they really

74
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:40,808
wanna have as much control as

75
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,349
possible. They don't wanna be,

76
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:43,229
um,

77
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,919
only using a single platform. I think in

78
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,240
companies like Warner Music and other big media

79
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,409
companies it's just not realistic to only

80
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:51,028
have one

81
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,770
system to store all of your data

82
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,444
given, you know, acquisitions and. Mergers

83
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,764
and uh changes that are happening

84
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,064
all the time in the industry

85
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,485
uh so this gives them uh an

86
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,485
open design framework so they could work with

87
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,574
that data uh wherever it sits

88
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,455
uh we kind of view it as a

89
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,044
composability is a word that we use a lot

90
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:11,564
where

91
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,963
uh you're kind of bringing in best of

92
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:16,044
breed from whatever tools make sense

93
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:17,743
for the data that you might be leveraging.

94
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,460
Uh, the ecosystem is a

95
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,508
big part of Iceberg as well, so you, you know,

96
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,729
as leveraging that, uh,

97
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,349
uh, format and that type, you're gonna get

98
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,490
access to a broader

99
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,710
network and system of tools

100
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,868
and data sources that, uh, become

101
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,729
accessible, uh, through the platform.

102
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,338
And then finally efficiency so,

103
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,788
uh, when it comes to Iceberg, one of the

104
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,058
big benefits is you don't have to have

105
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,899
multiple copies of your data.

106
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,699
Uh, you can make sure everyone's, uh,

107
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:49,919
accessing data consistently

108
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,740
and, uh, from the same place,

109
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:53,594
um. What we've seen,

110
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,205
uh, very recently, I was just looking at some of the,

111
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:58,615
uh, metrics on the media and entertainment

112
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,554
side just within, uh, Snowflake,

113
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,974
uh, we're seeing a ton of momentum, uh,

114
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,294
so just looking over the last quarter

115
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,413
we saw a 300%

116
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,314
increase in.

117
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,808
The number of queries that are being done

118
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:13,149
uh using Iceberg and the data that's sitting

119
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:13,659
within it,

120
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:16,629
um, and the 400%

121
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,660
increase in the, uh,

122
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,699
create process within those tables as well,

123
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,988
so, uh, massive adoption,

124
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,230
massive usage, and continued

125
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,730
growth is what we're seeing as well.

126
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:27,769
Um,

127
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,048
and this is, you know, a lot of reasons why

128
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,160
I think we're seeing a, uh, the

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,410
gravitation towards Iceberg is the

130
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,149
table format of choice.

131
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,699
Uh, the project has a lot of, uh,

132
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,088
supporters, uh, definitely not just snowflakes,

133
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,290
so AWS is, uh, definitely behind

134
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,028
it as well,

135
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,528
uh, and that rapid growth continues and

136
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,608
you get access to all of the

137
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:50,778
support behind that. Uh,

138
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:52,920
just looking at the momentum from

139
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,178
GitHub around the project,

140
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,298
uh, this is just a, you know, kind of timeline

141
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,980
on, uh, the active contributors

142
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,149
over the, uh, past couple

143
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:02,670
of years.

144
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,420
Uh, you could see Iceberg has

145
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,119
grown and continues. Take off,

146
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,899
uh, it's moving faster than other formats

147
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,899
like Delta Lake, um, and

148
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,988
some of the big contributors to the project are

149
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:14,858
Netflix,

150
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,439
Apple and Amazon,

151
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,858
uh, they tend to be always at the top in terms

152
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,838
of contributions for the project, so,

153
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,660
uh, you're in very good company.

154
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,399
Uh, what is,

155
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,569
how does this fit into the overall,

156
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:28,420
uh,

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,759
systems that customers are using?

158
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,040
Uh, so the lake house architecture is

159
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,369
one that we see,

160
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,798
uh, fairly widely adopted across

161
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,379
our customer base at this point,

162
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,939
and there's really these three layers,

163
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,119
uh, that are within that architecture.

164
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,369
So there's a compute layer, there's the catalog

165
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,819
layer, and the storage layer,

166
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,720
um,

167
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,250
and, uh.

168
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,819
The ability to have separation between

169
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,059
these and to understand how they operate

170
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,059
is what we'll talk through very quickly here as

171
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,119
well. Um, the storage layer

172
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,139
is really the foundation, so this

173
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,278
is sort of the, the place where

174
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,980
all of the data can come together,

175
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,420
uh, you get that benefit

176
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,600
of having the compatibility

177
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,858
across these different systems, uh, when you're taking

178
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:12,410
an iceberg approach with this,

179
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,199
um, and it's really gonna, uh,

180
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,309
kind of set you up for the, uh,

181
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,750
ability to collaborate across your teams

182
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,369
across the different entities that might be within your

183
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,500
organization. The

184
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,619
catalog layer becomes that source of

185
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,480
truth, so this is where

186
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,000
um the teams are able to have those

187
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,178
consistent views of the data sets

188
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,259
uh across teams uh this

189
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,238
becomes a place where

190
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:37,399
um

191
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,858
that common language comes

192
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,160
into place uh it has the

193
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,699
uh transactional rigor around it

194
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,899
that I think a lot of enterprise customers are looking

195
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,639
for as well.

196
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,379
Uh, and then finally the compute layer, and

197
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,619
this is really where all the work gets done. So

198
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,838
this is where, uh, you're gonna be

199
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,059
interacting and querying and

200
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,119
processing the data at the top layer,

201
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,298
uh, and this is,

202
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,579
you know, by having this foundation, this is

203
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,048
really what's gonna set you up to be able to execute

204
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,338
a lot of the innovative things that are happening

205
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:09,608
around, uh, AI and analytics

206
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,160
that we're seeing in the space right now.

207
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,629
Uh, these are,

208
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,970
uh, general recommendations

209
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,569
that we see around, uh, approaching,

210
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,869
uh, a lake house analytics approach.

211
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,689
Um, the first one would be

212
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,670
access, uh, and this is where.

213
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,329
You know, as an enterprise asking yourself,

214
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,309
uh, can you securely unify

215
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,548
all the data that your team needs wherever

216
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:34,569
it might sit,

217
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,290
uh, the second would be performance

218
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,509
and understanding the

219
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,670
requirements around concurrency and

220
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,209
speed,

221
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,619
uh, when it comes to all the data

222
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,170
customers that you're working with

223
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,509
and then finally empowerment. So are you

224
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,559
giving. The teams that you're working

225
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,928
with, uh, production ready data

226
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:55,290
to be able to build the products that they wanna build,

227
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,910
and that's an area where we've definitely seen the

228
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,959
pace of change, uh,

229
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,189
really pick up over the last couple of years,

230
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,389
the ability to,

231
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,949
you know, deliver code faster deliver data

232
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:06,608
faster,

233
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:09,269
uh, and the demands that all of our clients

234
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,350
continue to increase there so that's definitely an important

235
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,480
one. Uh, and then

236
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
finally this is, this is sort of

237
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,600
where things end up from a, a very high

238
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,899
level architecture perspective and

239
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,470
um what we wanna be able to do is,

240
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,869
you know, support the enterprise customers

241
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,920
that we work with, uh, make sure that

242
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,178
the entire business

243
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,579
is connected, uh, you have that

244
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,840
ecosystem of data sets that you're

245
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,259
working with, uh,

246
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,719
you have the ability to partner

247
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,759
with, uh, all of your customers

248
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,359
and external.

249
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:42,354
Uh, partners but also internal teams,

250
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:44,894
uh, to eliminate some of the

251
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,413
complexities that used to be there around having

252
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,575
copies of data and ETL

253
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,234
processes,

254
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,894
um, it really becomes simplified

255
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:54,994
when you take, uh, an iceberg approach,

256
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:56,875
uh, to your data lake house,

257
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,575
uh, and then finally.

258
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,349
Uh, just thinking about, you know, what are

259
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,469
the benefits when you get there, so

260
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:05,320
what happens as an end state,

261
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,869
uh, you're gonna have better query

262
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:11,029
performance, you're gonna have cost optimizations,

263
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,889
you have better data integration,

264
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,288
uh, scalability, and then finally,

265
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,428
um, you can do all of this in a cross

266
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:18,558
cloud environment

267
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,918
and, uh, with that

268
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,279
I will turn it over and, uh,

269
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:25,690
Michael's gonna take you through, uh,

270
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,750
exactly how this comes to life for Warner Music.

271
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,830
Yeah, thank you, um,

272
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,330
yeah, hey, it is, I guess I should click

273
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,519
ahead there we go, uh, when the iceberg Saves

274
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,399
you is what I entitled this, um,

275
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,769
maybe a little dramatic but not so much at

276
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,389
a complex organization like Warner,

277
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,119
um, so just a little bit about me, um,

278
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,440
uh, my name is Mike Jones, you call me Mike or Michael.

279
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,570
I am the director for data

280
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,009
engineering, so I own

281
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,529
basically all of our, uh, ETL

282
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,450
and pipelines at Warner Music Group,

283
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,369
um, and it's a very complicated

284
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,408
environment with. A lot of history and you're probably

285
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:01,690
here because you probably have a complicated environment

286
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,340
too and need iceberg in your life.

287
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,090
So what I would say about that is that um

288
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,149
this is this is just sort of an

289
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,340
opportunity for us to share

290
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,788
a little bit of about of our our experience

291
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,859
um working under a lot of constraints,

292
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,548
uh, some things we can't control, some things we can't control,

293
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,889
and being able to actually, um, you

294
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,379
know, uh, really create a seamless

295
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,710
data environment with a very complex system.

296
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:24,668
So I'll jump into that,

297
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,479
um. This is the agenda

298
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,899
we'll be going over. I'll, I'll tell you a little bit about WMG.

299
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:32,080
Maybe you already know about Warner Music. I'll go over the

300
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,119
challenges and just how we built

301
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,139
an architecture of interoperability,

302
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,879
um, and it's, that's not just marketing. We actually

303
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,859
have this, this working which is really cool,

304
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,359
um, with Iceberg as the, I don't know, connective

305
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,639
tissue is what we called it.

306
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,129
Uh, and I'll share some learnings and outcomes, uh, with

307
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:48,048
you after that.

308
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,729
So, um, Warner Music Group, uh,

309
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,320
Warner represents 75 years

310
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,460
of music history, so it's, it's a

311
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,009
pretty cool place.

312
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,808
It's pretty cool history.

313
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,340
I mean, you probably see artists up there that you

314
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,500
recognize, um, it's a really,

315
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:04,038
really exciting place to be,

316
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,298
and, um.

317
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,769
And you know it's kind of funny because it's the first

318
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:09,798
place where, where my kids were like, uh, Dad,

319
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:10,629
you have a cool job.

320
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,239
Like I, I worked in like AWS and drones

321
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,908
and stuff. No, no, no, this is cool.

322
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,960
I, you know, when you're 10 this music is cool, right?

323
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,529
And it is, it's, it's really cool and fascinating and

324
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,609
complicated business and so

325
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:23,989
we, we actually,

326
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:25,769
um, it, it houses.

327
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,349
Numerous labels and sub labels

328
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,609
and um what that means is that we have a

329
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:31,219
very

330
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:34,158
complex distributed decentralized

331
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:34,979
environment

332
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,440
um that doesn't have standardization in

333
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
a lot of areas and uh

334
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,779
that creates a lot of challenges for data

335
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,869
and also means that we're in a multi-engine

336
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,340
multi-platform environment

337
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:48,139
um and so

338
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,558
what I wanted to say too at the outset here is that

339
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:52,639
like. Uh, you know, being an

340
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,658
AWS alumni, if you looked at my LinkedIn

341
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:55,509
several years ago,

342
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,899
I'll appeal to like my favorite leadership principle

343
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,210
which is learn and be curious.

344
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:02,129
If you're gonna do anything with this stuff in an interoperable

345
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,210
environment, you need a lot of curiosity, and

346
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,739
curiosity is kind of the lifeblood of an

347
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,320
organization that can actually achieve great things.

348
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,619
And I think we've done some really, really cool stuff with

349
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,440
Snowflake and Iceberg and AWS

350
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:14,879
and other platform engines like Data bricks,

351
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,158
uh, over the, over the last couple of years.

352
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,298
And so I'll, I'll get into a bunch of that.

353
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,029
Um,

354
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:23,629
so I, I talked a little bit about this

355
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,908
before, but it, it's important to like

356
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,210
note that um

357
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,029
WMG tech is a centralized

358
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:30,928
corporate function

359
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:34,190
that sits underneath all of these decentralized

360
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,928
labels,

361
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,509
and that is really

362
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,565
challenging because those labels can make a. A lot of

363
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:41,654
autonomous decisions and have

364
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,673
for years

365
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,933
that have created a lot of history that we

366
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,075
can't just snap our fingers and change

367
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,533
and so what that means is even if we want to introduce

368
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,764
new technologies and practices and tools,

369
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:54,494
uh, new engines or teams want to use different

370
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:56,835
engines, all this stuff is still there

371
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,195
and it's evolving too

372
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,894
and so this is the kind of like context

373
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,764
in which we have to kind of like

374
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:05,514
challenge this is the challenge that we have with this stuff.

375
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,529
So in particular

376
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,038
we have all of our because we're

377
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,408
a multi-engine multi-vendor environment

378
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,649
and so all of our classic

379
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:15,729
lake house

380
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:17,668
and our BI,

381
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,500
our analysts, like our recorded music analysts,

382
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:21,219
marketing,

383
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,590
all of them are on Snowflake, so we have

384
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,830
like hundreds of pipelines, I think 600 pipelines

385
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,950
in Snowflake that are running.

386
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,440
Uh, from raw ingest all the way up through to gold

387
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,029
layer,

388
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,639
and our analysts and RM analysts

389
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,690
are BI. They prefer Snowflake as their tool

390
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,009
of choice. And

391
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,489
on the other hand, we have like a, a sizable

392
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,529
portion of infrastructure on data bricks

393
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,558
where, where our new data mesh is built.

394
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,168
So you can imagine we have like data bricks over here with a data

395
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:47,250
mesh, and then we've got like our classic lake house

396
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,250
medallion architecture over here with BI and RM.

397
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:51,658
And they need things from each other

398
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,000
and so that's where where we started to

399
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,080
really explore and get on this journey of learning

400
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,158
to figure out like hey like how can we

401
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,700
make all this work together.

402
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,639
Um, and so that's

403
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,200
the real question, like how do we take like

404
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,320
huge volumes of data and

405
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
um and be able to access

406
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,639
it across multiple

407
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,879
engines for a huge distributed

408
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,038
diverse decentralized group that

409
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,038
they don't really want standards all the

410
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:20,080
time and so you can't just make them do

411
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,019
it a certain way either.

412
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:23,346
So this, this is how the environment

413
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,346
that we're in and it, it poses a lot of challenge and

414
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:26,125
if we do it right,

415
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,785
uh, then we support our artists, our songwriters

416
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,275
better we can help them make better decisions with the data

417
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,705
and uh music thrives is

418
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:34,585
basically how it works.

419
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:37,184
So um so it's really exciting, a lot of

420
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:39,335
crazy challenging problems for us to deal with, um,

421
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,605
but that's that's why we're here and that's what's fun about it

422
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,251
so. I wanted to jump into just a

423
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,371
few of the use cases that

424
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:48,572
I've got that we have just to give you a flavor

425
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,392
of it. So

426
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,131
one of them is

427
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,270
we just launched WMG Pulse

428
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,692
and what that is is it's an artist and

429
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:58,692
songwriter facing app that serves

430
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:01,072
up analytical insights and financial transparency.

431
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,001
So it's a pretty cool,

432
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,270
pretty cool app.

433
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,230
That thing actually sits on top of.

434
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,029
Data products and the data mesh that themselves

435
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,269
are using data from Snowflake that's raw ingested

436
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:13,529
and transformed under Snowflake. So that's one challenge. So

437
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,908
how do you do that? Like, do we manually

438
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:17,908
copy data around? Do you like use

439
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,070
federated queries every everywhere? Do we reverse

440
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,070
ETL it? These are like the challenges that we

441
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,190
hit. Second example I mentioned our

442
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,710
BI, our marketing, our recorded music and analysts.

443
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:27,690
They're using

444
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,090
like Snowflake,

445
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,090
uh, they're, they're, they're

446
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,788
the entire BI. An analyst community

447
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:36,178
is is heavily built onto Snowflake. They use Tableau.

448
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,460
They use a lot of direct queries.

449
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:38,558
They have a lot of

450
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:41,058
what we call homebrew ETL that they've built on

451
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:43,340
top of the fundamental data pipelines.

452
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,979
That stuff is all on Snowflake,

453
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,219
and it has millions, actually, sorry, so it's like

454
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:49,479
billions of queries a month,

455
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:52,298
and it also now needs data from

456
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:54,210
the data mesh too, as well as other sources.

457
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,019
I'm talking about that, but we've got stuff in Legacy, Postgress,

458
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,418
Oracle, all over the place.

459
00:15:59,009 --> 00:15:59,519
Um,

460
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:02,090
then we have our ML team. They prefer to use ML

461
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,168
flow, uh, so that's sitting in data bricks, but

462
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:06,250
they're working on a lot of data in Snowflake, and

463
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,129
we actually do do some,

464
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:09,489
we do do AI and ML on Snowflake as well.

465
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,330
So there's this back and forth of data

466
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,570
across both there again.

467
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,779
And then

468
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,340
there's 3rd party integrations where we literally need to

469
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,359
share hundreds of terabytes of constantly

470
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,489
evolving data with third parties

471
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
and and receive data from those third parties.

472
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,119
So like a good example would be like Spotify

473
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,320
sends us streaming data, so we get billions

474
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,259
of rows a day

475
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,668
from these streaming things because you all like

476
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,678
to listen to music and so we get lots

477
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:35,859
of streams coming in all the time.

478
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,000
And so that stuff comes in through Snowflake

479
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,109
and then has to go out to all these other systems.

480
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,619
So we have a lot of challenges.

481
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,710
Um, and I wanted to

482
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,928
start with like the goal of

483
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:48,298
what we're trying to do, OK?

484
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,830
So I'll, I'll put this image up in front of

485
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,658
you right now,

486
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:53,989
because I'll come back to it, but I wanted to show you

487
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:54,849
this, this.

488
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,558
This kind of vision of it, so you'll notice in the middle there,

489
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,219
it's not too small for you,

490
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:02,080
that we have this unified iceberg

491
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,869
data layer,

492
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,279
OK, and then on the right you've got the engine,

493
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,920
so you'll see you've got Snowflake there,

494
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,479
data bricks, there's all these legacy analytical

495
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,680
tools, there's a bunch of third party stuff flying

496
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,239
around in there.

497
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,739
And on the other side there's sources, this could be like

498
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,150
Spotify, DSPs, that type of thing like

499
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,680
we get.

500
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,430
And so this is the goal. This is the goal is that we somehow

501
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,890
live in this beautiful harmony

502
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,549
where we get tons of data from all these eclectic

503
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:25,098
sources.

504
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,509
It's just magically all in the right place, and

505
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,549
then all of these things with all their differences can

506
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,848
just use that data magically, right? And

507
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,519
Right, it's not quite magical and it didn't get there

508
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,519
magically, but it's not that far off now, which

509
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,299
is kind of cool.

510
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,199
So what I wanted to jump in is

511
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:42,439
use and show you is just use one

512
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,640
example as kind of a case study

513
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,189
for this.

514
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,559
This isn't the only example we've got, and we're doing a lot

515
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,180
of other stuff, but this one was

516
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:52,199
fairly easy. It doesn't have much proprietary

517
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,180
concerns, so it's really easy for me to talk about,

518
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,358
um. So,

519
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,039
I wanted to share about WMG Opus

520
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,239
on Iceberg. Now Opus is

521
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,699
an internal tool

522
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,959
um that's used by, I think it's about 700

523
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,969
users at Warner Music, so it's our most

524
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:08,699
used tool.

525
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,029
And it essentially

526
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,559
is a tool for viewing like streams,

527
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,848
social data, charts, playlists. You can

528
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:16,949
go there and look at how

529
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,328
an artist is, is doing on all of

530
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,529
these metrics internally, and it's also

531
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:23,630
externally facing. We actually have

532
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:25,930
external users who connect to this thing.

533
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,199
And so

534
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,640
this, this

535
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:31,029
tool is, um,

536
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,299
it exists as sort of a, it's

537
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,338
a React app, well React

538
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,529
website that sits on top of a legacy

539
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,390
Java Spring

540
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,598
backend called DVAPI.

541
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,358
And that Legacy JavaSpring backend actually

542
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,660
does a lot of direct reads of Snowflake.

543
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,000
So just for the streaming data

544
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,019
alone, and by that I mean like you're listening to music,

545
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,420
there's 15 APIs with all of their sub-routes

546
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,640
that themselves call dozens of different tables

547
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,868
in Snowflake directly.

548
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,289
So you're like, why are you crying? Snowflake directly, that's a really

549
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:01,660
good question. Operational thing querying analytical

550
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,689
space, not maybe the best way to do it, but that's what's

551
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,689
there, and it's built that way, and it can

552
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,059
take 20 seconds to query

553
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,029
at times, which is not the best,

554
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,598
but it's there, and these are the kind of constraints

555
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:13,729
that we operate under because this is the most used

556
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:14,868
tool that we have.

557
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,189
And so

558
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,608
one of the challenges that we hit right away

559
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,650
was that Opus actually needed to

560
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,549
use a net new,

561
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:23,868
a new streaming

562
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,170
product in our data bricks data mesh.

563
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,348
So now you can imagine this stack here

564
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,848
in Opus, and I wonder if I have it on the next slide.

565
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,029
Yes, I do. Here we go.

566
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:33,160
So

567
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,828
this one here, if you look at this, we've got

568
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,309
Opus sitting there

569
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,170
on top of what's called our DV data visualization

570
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,750
API.

571
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,130
So this is a legacy API, the JavaSpring thing

572
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,068
I was talking about,

573
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,868
and we, it's reading from

574
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,539
snowflake gold, snowflake silver, bronze, which is all

575
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,890
processed through there. There's, there's a lot of pipelines

576
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,969
that are going in. This is hundreds of terabytes of data

577
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:56,239
that's processed through here. And aggregated

578
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,318
and transformed and re-transformed and re-aggregated

579
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,318
and and eventually served up to be

580
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,838
like, hey, you know what your track is outperforming

581
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:03,880
in country X

582
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,699
so this here is the

583
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,900
the just the high level architecture

584
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,259
and we needed to actually get data

585
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:12,858
from data bricks

586
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,939
into DV API.

587
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,630
And so it's like, well, what are, what are kind of the

588
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,529
options we have here?

589
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,358
Well, um,

590
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,410
we could migrate DVAPI to data bricks, but

591
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,368
that would be just

592
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,848
prohibitive for one thing.

593
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,799
There's tons of other APIs that run on

594
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,920
it. Uh, there's a lot of other snowflake stuff

595
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,900
that's gonna live there

596
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,318
forever. We're not gonna, we don't wanna change that

597
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,699
stuff. We don't actually have

598
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,799
that big an engineering team on Opus

599
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,880
and DB API anymore. It's actually largely

600
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,775
pretty small. It's in like. KTLO mode,

601
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,213
but it's still heavily used by the business so

602
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,354
again you've got to work within the constraints that you've got.

603
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:50,404
The other problem is is that it's, it's

604
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,414
extremely disruptive to go and change this

605
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,493
API out from under the hood, like

606
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:56,834
to re-engineer it. It's a huge effort,

607
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,525
um, and again, as I said,

608
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,894
the BI and analysts prefer Snowflake, so

609
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,924
what that means is they're actually reading the tables

610
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:04,953
directly themselves

611
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,295
and looking at them and getting information from them, and that's

612
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:08,295
where they want to do it.

613
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,108
So we can't just go like

614
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,539
pull the rug out and just be like, OK, let's put this over

615
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,209
on a different engine, that won't work.

616
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,828
And like I said, there's stuff that are not on that

617
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,250
engine, we actually need it from both.

618
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,848
The second option is what, what

619
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,328
I kind of threw up here is like legacy delta integration.

620
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,098
This was,

621
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,529
I, I like to joke half my production stack is on

622
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:29,130
private previews, but we're actually looking at like DLT

623
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,219
private previews with Snowflake on like being able

624
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,838
to just direct read Delta.

625
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,539
Uh, it doesn't, didn't work very well and it's since evolved

626
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,578
into a much better system, but this was

627
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,848
back in 2023. It's, it's not really

628
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:40,729
a great option,

629
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,219
but um. We're, we're looking at this,

630
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,660
and then the third one was uniform iceberg.

631
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,680
Now if you know uniform, that's like

632
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,209
Databer's Unity catalog Iceberg can

633
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,299
export. So into Iceberg they can just

634
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:53,130
take delta,

635
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,009
a delta table which is parquet,

636
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,500
and you just wrap a delta log metadata around it

637
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:58,939
and then loop, and

638
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,719
lo and behold, if you go drop that thing into S3,

639
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,019
Snowflake

640
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,500
catalog can go and point at it and read

641
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,779
it. Through the rest API, so

642
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,578
that's pretty cool.

643
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,608
So this was like hmm, we're like maybe that'll work.

644
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,390
So we,

645
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,818
that's what we did we set this up, the,

646
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,630
the, we set it up so that

647
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:17,699
we would actually

648
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,118
um take the streaming data from

649
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:21,259
this data product.

650
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,588
And using the original, the same snowflake

651
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:25,289
tables

652
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:27,289
that the API is reading from.

653
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:30,118
We would actually just point those tables

654
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,259
at essentially using the rest as the

655
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,358
API to S3.

656
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,318
We just point them at the iceberg tables

657
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:36,900
and produce them there,

658
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,259
which meant, and I think this is what's really cool and

659
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,489
probably one of the biggest changes over the years,

660
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,400
we could bring Snowflake to the data,

661
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,858
which is really, really cool, right? Like we didn't

662
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:47,130
have to bring the data in, we could bring snowflake to the data,

663
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,838
which I think was really an awesome thing that we were able

664
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:52,239
to start doing, and this was just the start of it, so.

665
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,838
What we saw with this, and this is really the

666
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:56,598
key insight,

667
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,959
was to make our entire

668
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,939
data layer

669
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,539
platform and engine agnostic.

670
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,390
This is like the big idea that kind of clicked

671
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,299
at a moment, like, wait a minute, why don't we.

672
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:09,828
Why don't we just actually make it agnostic

673
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:11,130
so that I can point

674
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:13,618
Snowflake at anything I want and Snowflake can produce

675
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:15,750
whatever I want in Iceberg and vice versa

676
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,368
with other engines like data bricks,

677
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,789
and that way I don't actually have to choose. I can get the

678
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,209
best of both worlds simultaneously

679
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:24,588
and actually we have, we have a lot more

680
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,750
optionality and strengths, and you can leverage

681
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,769
the innovations that are coming out of multiple

682
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,459
platforms at the same time, which is really

683
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,539
interesting. So we

684
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,439
had our initial success with Iceberg,

685
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,160
um, and

686
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:38,618
a little interesting,

687
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,098
um, there's supposed to be a diagram there, but I'm

688
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:41,858
not sure where it went.

689
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,459
Maybe it's the next slide. Oh yeah, there we go. OK, cool, not

690
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,049
sure why I did that.

691
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:47,598
OK, so we had our initial success with Iceberg,

692
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:49,979
and this is where sort of our, our

693
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:51,719
first application of snowflake.

694
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,348
It was running a billion queries

695
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:56,598
per month. It's running a billion queries a month

696
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:58,439
through those snowflake tables

697
00:23:58,818 --> 00:23:59,828
into Iceberg.

698
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Um, and so that was half the half the battle

699
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,699
to start. The second half is how do

700
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:07,199
we get the data products to read data from Snowflake.

701
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,400
I haven't talked about this yet, but ironically

702
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:11,979
the data mesh actually is reading tons of bronze

703
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,699
and silver data from Snowflake.

704
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,250
So they, so initially they start, the

705
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,358
team started out doing this with federated query.

706
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,098
And if you don't know what a federated query is, basically

707
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,390
what it is, is, is from, from

708
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,088
say Data Brook's perspective, what they're gonna do

709
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,868
is you're gonna fire up a cluster, it's gonna dispatch

710
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,289
a query over to Snowflake. That cluster is gonna sit there

711
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,189
waiting.

712
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Spending money, but it will sit there, and

713
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,039
Snowflake will actually run the query, and then the

714
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,318
answer comes back. So you actually have double compute

715
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:40,318
happening while your query's dispatched over

716
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:41,259
and then it comes back.

717
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:44,068
So this, this works, but it's,

718
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,180
it's kind of not great in some

719
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,459
ways because your EC2 usage just

720
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,759
skyrockets while it's handling all of this

721
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,910
metadata processing and everything else.

722
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,578
So, so this, this was what we had

723
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,578
set up initially

724
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,039
and, and

725
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,078
eventually what we did was,

726
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,699
especially through the innovations coming out of Snowflake, we

727
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:05,239
were actually able to flip this over to federate a catalog

728
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,539
with ice. Which

729
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:07,979
essentially meant

730
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,059
easy to

731
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,559
really down we didn't have to actually spend that

732
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,858
for all of the processing

733
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,380
um we didn't have to dispatch queries.

734
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Data bricks could directly read the

735
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,199
tables published. Published is not

736
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,239
the technical word, but the tables that are available from

737
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,098
Snowflake

738
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,259
either through managed or external iceberg

739
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,420
in Snowflake, which is really cool,

740
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,578
so.

741
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:31,818
That brought us to this,

742
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:34,078
and this is the thing that is kind

743
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:34,739
of like,

744
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:37,239
wow, we actually went and did this, uh but uh

745
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:39,598
you remember the diagram I showed you on the left that was original

746
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:40,500
architecture.

747
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:43,118
If you look at the bottom there, you'll see we've got

748
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:44,588
that red box there,

749
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,160
and what's happening there is that that

750
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,699
um

751
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:50,479
that is essentially the data

752
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:52,588
product that lives in data bricks, and what it does is it

753
00:25:52,588 --> 00:25:54,019
uses federated catalog

754
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,338
to read from the bronze silver layers in Snowflake.

755
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,719
And it actually makes the result

756
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,789
available back to Snowflake

757
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,449
via iceberg.

758
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:06,279
Uh, essentially what I said you can

759
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,059
publish delta tables as

760
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,519
um because they're so similar you can

761
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,519
publish them essentially as Iceberg and Snowflake can just

762
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,500
pick them right up

763
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,670
and then they're available and what was really cool

764
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,680
is that this actually worked and it worked really

765
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,799
well like we only saw a performance

766
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,989
drop of about 10% in terms of query

767
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:23,578
performance

768
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:26,358
from the application and that didn't even matter

769
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:28,439
because the hit was absorbed by

770
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,618
the parallelization within the app actually

771
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,259
the Opus actually running.

772
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,019
So what this meant was we were actually

773
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,959
able to interleaave

774
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,118
different engines together

775
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,439
pretty much seamlessly with zero copies

776
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,680
um in a performance application,

777
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,380
and we did it

778
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:48,939
without any of the business users noticing. So we just

779
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:49,959
did this under the hood,

780
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,430
we told them it was happening just in case something went wrong, but,

781
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:53,170
but they didn't,

782
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:55,789
they didn't notice. They were like, we didn't notice a difference.

783
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,479
We're like,

784
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:59,019
yes, that doesn't always happen for us,

785
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,019
believe me, but it happened this time, so,

786
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:02,618
so I see some guys laughing.

787
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,170
Uh, but yes, it doesn't always happen, but it did work this

788
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,170
time. So this actually worked, and this was

789
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,650
like something that would have been like we couldn't have even

790
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,390
imagined

791
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,890
a few years ago in terms of the level

792
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,949
of interoperability that we could achieve.

793
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,969
And so this, this actually ends

794
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,709
up like

795
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,250
opening up the doors for us. Like, so

796
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,368
what we did was we, we expanded our success

797
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,368
by sort of expanding our iceberg usage. So this

798
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:26,750
is just another example where

799
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:29,479
like why use a REST API on

800
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:31,910
S3 when Snowflake has what's called native iceberg.

801
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:34,650
Um, I don't know if that's what you're still calling it, but essentially

802
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,709
like Snowflake can actually manage

803
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,809
the table. I think it's managed iceberg can manage the

804
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:39,769
table for you,

805
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:42,358
and so you don't actually need it, it actually

806
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:44,469
appears as like a snowflake native table,

807
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,049
um, but it's available for external readers if

808
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,130
you want to read it. There's some constraints like

809
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,130
they can't write to it naturally, but, but that's

810
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,390
perfect for us. We just want to make data available,

811
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:56,009
um, but this is really, really cool because

812
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,029
now we can use this to share data

813
00:27:58,449 --> 00:27:59,578
with third parties.

814
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,189
And actually other parts of our business

815
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,568
as well as we can get other vendors

816
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,969
and partners to give data to us like this.

817
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,059
Which means we don't have to spend a ton of compute

818
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,348
processing ingestion of rows and stuff.

819
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,959
We just take an iceberg table, Snowflake can wrap

820
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:16,500
it up

821
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,719
one way or the other, whether managed or external,

822
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,680
and we can make it available and then we can seamlessly

823
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,920
weave our engines together,

824
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:25,318
which opens up a lot of doors for machine

825
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,439
learning and AI where they have to go and grab

826
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,479
sources from all kinds of

827
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,098
wild places in our business.

828
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,789
So this is what's really kind of an exciting thing for

829
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,358
us. And this lands us on this

830
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,400
what I call unified interrup between

831
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,858
data platforms. So

832
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:42,858
on the, the, so I've got a kind of like

833
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,160
space you can kind of see the different options there

834
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,318
like how do you read from Snowflake? Well, a

835
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:49,400
snowflake manage table is really great for that.

836
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,838
So that's what we're doing. We're creating these snowflake managed

837
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:52,459
tables,

838
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,150
and there's so much work happening on this front on. Snowflake, this

839
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,269
is getting better like by the month almost, which

840
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,029
is awesome,

841
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,568
um, getting more seamless, more efficient,

842
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:02,318
uh, uh, almost monthly,

843
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,858
and so it's really, really cool what's happening, but we're actually

844
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:05,608
able to then

845
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:08,108
make this data to any data, any

846
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:08,809
of our data,

847
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:11,269
which is about 3.2 petabytes

848
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:13,390
in snowflake, and we've got about 4 petabytes in

849
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,170
data bricks.

850
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,289
Um,

851
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,880
and so between the, it's about 50/50

852
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,219
between that amount of data

853
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,368
that's in these 22 spaces

854
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,739
we're able to make any of that data available

855
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:26,160
for any side of it. So that means we don't

856
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,430
have to actually rewrite engines, we can just bring the

857
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,098
engine to the data,

858
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,660
which is really, really slick for us

859
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,259
for reading into Snowflake.

860
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,549
Same thing, you just, we could use an externally

861
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,449
managed table,

862
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,039
which is what I described earlier with Opus, and

863
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,469
this data just flows right in and

864
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,479
and we're able to do it.

865
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,259
Um, so

866
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,559
this, there's, there's a number of edges to

867
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,900
this, of course, because,

868
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:50,959
uh, with anything like this, the, there's a bit of devil

869
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,269
in the details, which is why I mentioned curiosity

870
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,059
at the beginning.

871
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:56,838
Um, it doesn't always click

872
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,959
together perfectly. There's a lot of

873
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,500
like

874
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,920
little platform differences such as how they treat

875
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,160
metadata, how they update it between things

876
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,358
that can be challenging,

877
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,880
and uh, I'm a bit on that later, but

878
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,959
this is where like.

879
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,439
If you can kind of get over a bit of those what I

880
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,588
call just teething pains because it's like way better

881
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:14,479
than it was before,

882
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,039
you can actually get over those teething pains and then it

883
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,039
just works pretty seamlessly, and

884
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,779
those things are being

885
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,420
improved constantly, which is awesome.

886
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So I just outlined there when

887
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,078
you want to use either like snowflake managed or

888
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:29,118
externally managed, you can go and dig up on

889
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,828
that. There's plenty of documentation on it,

890
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,618
but by putting those two

891
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,559
approaches together from a snowflake perspective,

892
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,939
you're actually able to get the full in and out

893
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,660
interoperation. story

894
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,400
in a format that is widely supported and

895
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,759
I mean you, you saw it on the graph,

896
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,959
but really like not a lot of engines are are

897
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,039
like reading Delta Lake natively for

898
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,279
example in in our environment so

899
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,338
like we just don't have that option even though a lot of our

900
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:54,578
data is in DLT right

901
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,299
um so iceberg is the way for us to go

902
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:58,618
and so.

903
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:01,739
What happens is is that iceberg becomes this

904
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,799
interoperability layer,

905
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,910
and it turns like our data mesh,

906
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,539
data bricks, and our classic data lake in Snowflake

907
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:11,759
into this like unified multi-platform

908
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,318
collaboration friendly system.

909
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,799
And it's not just marketing

910
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,709
speak, it actually works, and

911
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,380
they've had teething pains along the way, but it works

912
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,818
and it works really well, and

913
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,318
we're actually, it works so well for us we're actually

914
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,420
like even the engineers are visibly excited

915
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,068
about it at this point. They're just like,

916
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,479
wow, wait a minute, we could use iceberg over

917
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,670
here and it will simplify this, and we can use it over here and it'll

918
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,578
simplify this,

919
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:36,000
and now we're basically just constrained on our own ability

920
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,160
to convert these tables and make them

921
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,094
available and stuff, but once they are there. Um,

922
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:43,104
it becomes sort of a unified way where if someone

923
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,594
says I need this data, we're like icebergify

924
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:47,625
it. I don't know if that's a verb yet,

925
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:49,723
but icebergify it and, uh,

926
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:50,775
and it's there for you,

927
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:53,223
which is what we're doing, um, so just

928
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:55,305
this month, like hundreds of more terabytes

929
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:57,344
are being icebergified right now as I

930
00:31:57,344 --> 00:31:59,545
speak, and it should be done. The job should be done today,

931
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,864
uh, but we're doing it literally more and more with

932
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:04,285
more data to make it available and make it more seamless,

933
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,084
um, which is really, really neat.

934
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,269
Um, so that means that

935
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:11,769
Snowflake for, for Snowflake

936
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,868
and any other engines, Iceberg becomes this

937
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:15,549
API between the systems.

938
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:18,269
That's the other way that I'd like to think about it. You've

939
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:18,969
got this

940
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,309
data layer that's agnostic of the

941
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:22,430
platform that you're on

942
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:24,088
or the engine you're on.

943
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,588
And you can store that data layer wherever you

944
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:29,088
want, um, and actually

945
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:31,750
all the engines typically because they, they're natively

946
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,949
supporting it, even if they own it

947
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:36,848
like a snowflake managed table, it's effectively

948
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:38,848
an engine agnostic representation

949
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:41,309
so it's really nice you don't actually have to move the data out you

950
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,140
can just like

951
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,509
you flip switches and suddenly it's available,

952
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:45,568
which is really, really cool.

953
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,848
So what this means is now

954
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:50,910
with Iceberg we are actually

955
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,368
processing like billions of queries

956
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:54,449
a month.

957
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:57,068
We have hundreds of terabytes with Iceberg

958
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:58,449
right now. We are,

959
00:32:58,828 --> 00:33:01,189
we have started on this journey of integrating

960
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:01,930
vendors

961
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,469
with it, like external third party

962
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:06,509
vendors. We have to send a lot of data out

963
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:08,588
to third parties and we have to get a lot of

964
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:09,848
data from third parties

965
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,229
and we have.

966
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:12,170
Kinda,

967
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,809
kinda old legacy reverse ETL

968
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,949
systems, they work for doing that like

969
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:17,660
CDC,

970
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:20,269
that type of thing, but this is way better.

971
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,469
Like we want Iceberg to be actually the

972
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:24,469
API that if you were to go to Warner Music Group and

973
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,910
want an integration, we'd say,

974
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,068
oh yeah, Iceberg,

975
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:29,509
because it's actually kind of difficult for them if they,

976
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:31,680
if they don't have Snowflake, it's harder for them to connect

977
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,568
to our snowflake

978
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,078
and and that type of thing. So this makes it way,

979
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:35,729
way easier.

980
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:37,299
So

981
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:39,160
what this means is that like

982
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:41,618
we actually are able to like move

983
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,779
the data back and forth between platforms

984
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:44,880
and make it available

985
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:47,318
in this like triangle of third parties

986
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,338
to multiple engines and in the middle we've got

987
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:51,338
this this agnostic data layer

988
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,880
that you can read and write from

989
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:55,779
from any position and use for any use

990
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:56,640
case without

991
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,134
costs. Uh, without extra

992
00:33:59,134 --> 00:33:59,765
copies,

993
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:01,875
without having to do translations,

994
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:04,285
and all the benefits you said before it's like asset

995
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:06,375
compliant, you get actually history if you

996
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,514
look at the architecture of how Iceberg is,

997
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:10,864
um, it's really cool because you're essentially

998
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:12,974
just updating like pointers to manifest

999
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:15,054
files. So as long as you haven't vacuumed up your

1000
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,054
old data, you actually have time travel going

1001
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,135
backward for Iceberg.

1002
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:20,695
So it's really neat and Iceberg

1003
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,813
V3 and V4 I think are coming out, so it's

1004
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,715
like there's a lot more that's coming up too.

1005
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,798
So I'll talk about a little bit about the

1006
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:30,117
learnings and we're gonna open it up for some some

1007
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,137
discussion, I think

1008
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,677
um so here's a few, a few things. So this is some

1009
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:35,998
of the the snowflake ones, uh, snowflake

1010
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:36,579
learnings,

1011
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:38,938
and then I've got a little bit on outcomes

1012
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:41,778
so, so initially, and I think actually

1013
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,418
almost all of these things are in progress right now

1014
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,465
actually so, so that's. Shows you the rate of

1015
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,625
change, but initially there was like no

1016
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,206
fail-safe. Like you had to manage your own backups and versioning.

1017
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,945
Um, I think the Lake House team is actually doing some pretty cool

1018
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:55,675
stuff here now as well. Um,

1019
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:58,985
right now presently there is a conversion

1020
00:34:58,985 --> 00:35:01,144
compute required if you migrate from standard

1021
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:02,605
snowflake tables to iceberg.

1022
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:05,105
It's like a one time unload and reload

1023
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:05,644
of your data.

1024
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:08,371
It can be pretty big if you're doing it for like

1025
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,481
a large amount of data, but if you have a

1026
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,612
large amount of data, it's relatively small compared

1027
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,510
to what you're probably spending in compute anyway,

1028
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:17,010
and then the benefit is quite worth it once it's done.

1029
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,411
So, so this is a little different

1030
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,621
because on on other engines like a, a,

1031
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,731
a data bricks, um, because it's DLT and

1032
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:25,771
it's in parquet already, they just wrap metadata

1033
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:26,311
around it,

1034
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:28,971
um, whereas Snowflake still has to do this conversion

1035
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:31,132
thing right now, um, but that's, that's

1036
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:33,251
in progress right now with them, which is really cool. I think

1037
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:35,530
we're gonna, there's gonna be some really neat changes there.

1038
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:38,429
Um, partition file sizes. So one of the

1039
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,530
interesting things was that

1040
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:42,260
for a, a snowflake external table,

1041
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,708
the initial partition size was 16 megabytes,

1042
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,590
which if you know anything about Iceberg, they recommend like 256

1043
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,510
to 512.

1044
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,909
And what that means is that let's say

1045
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:52,449
you have a billion queries a month

1046
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:54,829
and your partition sizes are 16 megabytes.

1047
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:57,744
And you need to prune data for these queries.

1048
00:35:58,215 --> 00:35:58,934
If you might

1049
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:01,684
do the, you know, AWS engineer math

1050
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:04,054
in your head, you might be thinking, oh, wait a minute, that probably

1051
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,175
means that you're gonna get a lot of API calls.

1052
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:08,375
And you're right, you get a lot of API calls

1053
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:09,764
with something like that happening.

1054
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:12,414
So this initially hit us and like our, our

1055
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:13,655
API usage just went

1056
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:15,465
skyrocketed.

1057
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,934
So that was really interesting learning. It's like, OK, and

1058
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:20,574
then uh we worked with Snowflake and we got 128

1059
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:21,994
megabyte partitions and

1060
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:23,135
came right down.

1061
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,139
So that was a really interesting learning there.

1062
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,199
We were able to tune this partition size and and

1063
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,938
make it much more efficient there,

1064
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,918
um, and of course that would apply to an external

1065
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,978
table. A Snowflake managed table would

1066
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:37,679
handle it for you natively, which is really

1067
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,719
cool. Um, this, the external

1068
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,159
one, you're responsible for storing it, and Snowflake

1069
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,280
basically has a metadata pointer that that

1070
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,659
uses it. So that's why

1071
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,280
you have this like sort of custom

1072
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,958
configuration that you have to do on it.

1073
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,530
Um, and then there's some other issues like

1074
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,648
we've hit like auto refresh can sometimes stop

1075
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:56,728
silently and so this is what I

1076
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,228
mean, there's these little edges

1077
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,530
that you gotta monitor and just make sure it works

1078
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,148
in the integration that you have.

1079
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,610
And so what we often have done with the deployment

1080
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,610
is we actually just run an iceberg in parallel

1081
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,760
with an existing system or we monitor

1082
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,769
it for a week or two and we just make sure that it's working

1083
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,148
and then we, we flip it over.

1084
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,369
Um, and on the other side,

1085
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:15,260
um,

1086
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,750
so these are some of the iceberg learnings from the other

1087
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,289
side. Um,

1088
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,688
Uniform has its own constraints,

1089
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,820
um, so, uh, the,

1090
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,739
the client access is read only,

1091
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,030
so if you wanna write to anything you have to go

1092
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,148
through Delta. That's similar to

1093
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,579
like a Snowflake manage table, but, uh,

1094
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,815
but it's, it's a constraint. There as well.

1095
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,436
More importantly though, Uniform didn't work with deletion

1096
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:40,005
vectors, and it didn't support multi-table,

1097
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:42,065
multi-statement transactions.

1098
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:44,554
And if you've done anything with a really complicated

1099
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,905
multi-statement transaction in snowflake,

1100
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:49,195
you really feel that when it's not there,

1101
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:51,795
and it meant that for some of our streaming

1102
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:52,505
jobs,

1103
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:55,215
their aggregates would not come together in a synchronized.

1104
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,101
Way so we'd actually have like

1105
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,561
oh the month over month streams

1106
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,721
don't quite match the week over week streams

1107
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:03,141
for like a couple of hours

1108
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,240
and that's kind of a pain so they're

1109
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
also to my knowledge working on these things as well

1110
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,592
so the next version of Iceberg will solve that which

1111
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,592
just makes it easier to bring Snowflake to

1112
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:13,302
that data

1113
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:15,530
and vice versa, which is really neat.

1114
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,489
So I won't, I won't go into too much about like choosing

1115
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:21,610
the format, but there are options for how

1116
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,869
you can do it with like

1117
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:25,409
you can do delta with Unity

1118
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,489
catalog, you can choose native iceberg or you

1119
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:29,648
can choose, uh, you can use uniform

1120
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,849
to bring like native iceberg and delta tables

1121
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,898
together. Um, but just the, the

1122
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,000
takeaway here is that

1123
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,938
apply curiosity because there's going to be edges

1124
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:39,079
involved with these things

1125
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:41,800
and there's sophisticated

1126
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,978
integration between the metadata

1127
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:45,500
management between engines

1128
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,849
and that metadata management, it doesn't just

1129
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:50,059
always plug in sometimes it. Doesn't work so

1130
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,179
we've had to do like custom jobs that have run

1131
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,398
for a temporary period of time

1132
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,239
that just update metadata

1133
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:57,760
uh for this uh and and actually

1134
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,179
we've worked directly with with partners like Snowflake

1135
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,378
and they've actually like enhanced the offering

1136
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,378
and and then that we didn't have to do that anymore

1137
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:05,320
which is really cool

1138
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:06,688
um

1139
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,260
so outcomes uh where do we land with

1140
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
all this? I think you probably got the the gist already

1141
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,918
but it's working pretty well for us

1142
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,320
um so improved efficiency

1143
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,918
um so the one of the big things is that.

1144
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,648
Massively reduced copies, compute,

1145
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:21,760
and EC2

1146
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:24,639
for all of these shenanigans that we're doing

1147
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,878
moving data around. So it's actually really

1148
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,958
come down. We had a 70% reduction in our

1149
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,398
EC2 usage from

1150
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,918
the data brick side in terms of managing

1151
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,039
metadata and everything, which is really great. So

1152
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,619
it helped reduce our costs there.

1153
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,418
We also got this, this dream

1154
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,719
together of a single consistent

1155
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,039
data layer and source of truth where we have applied

1156
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,289
it. So that means uh

1157
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:48,559
our internal tools like Opus

1158
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,418
and externally facing ones like

1159
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:53,458
or artist facing ones like WMG Pulse,

1160
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,128
our ML feature store,

1161
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,489
they're actually able to use the same

1162
00:39:57,489 --> 00:39:59,840
tables in an engine agnostic way

1163
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,699
across these different offerings, and that's a

1164
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,239
really big deal for us because.

1165
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:06,199
We, because

1166
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,739
we actually have a business where

1167
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,969
a lot of business users are skeptical of the data,

1168
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,530
right, and you probably, if you're,

1169
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,199
if you're in a complex organization,

1170
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,619
they're probably like, can I trust it? And so one

1171
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,599
of the worst things for trust in data

1172
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:21,289
is if you have two clocks, right? Like,

1173
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,659
so, so it's not good when you have different

1174
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,929
representations. So I, I view Iceberg

1175
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:28,090
as a lever for helping with that

1176
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,219
organizational problem, not just the technical one

1177
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,500
of trust in data, because you can at least

1178
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,829
get down to one clock.

1179
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,579
And not have a 2 clock problem and once you're there,

1180
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,898
you can start to characterize that data and

1181
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:40,978
prove it's good or correct it or or show

1182
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:41,849
how good it is,

1183
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,119
and you don't have to do that multiple times

1184
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:46,599
because anytime someone sees a different data source

1185
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,978
they're gonna go and ask, wait a minute, which one's right? Is

1186
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:51,219
this one right? And they probably have a bias

1187
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,898
about it too and be like, I think this one's right.

1188
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:55,590
So like a lot of the little the requests

1189
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,789
I get from our business users are like, hey,

1190
00:40:57,849 --> 00:40:59,869
I saw this data anomaly and it doesn't make

1191
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,909
sense. And so can you help us

1192
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:04,168
figure it out? We have a thing that we need to launch

1193
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:05,800
yesterday or something like that, right?

1194
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,148
So it's really quite an interesting space to

1195
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:10,188
be in where providing

1196
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:11,128
this one

1197
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,829
single representation of the data also

1198
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,570
helps us to build trust with stakeholders

1199
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,989
in terms of what that data is and it

1200
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:21,179
simplifies our effort to characterize and

1201
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,489
improve data quality as well.

1202
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,918
Um,

1203
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,590
the other thing is we saw shorter time to get

1204
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,989
insights out, so we didn't have to set up

1205
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,648
complex sophisticated systems

1206
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,329
for serving up data to WMG Pulse,

1207
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:36,550
um, and what that meant was we were able to actually

1208
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,590
leverage, we brought Snowflake with all

1209
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,590
of its data to the data products that are

1210
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,418
powering Pulse,

1211
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:43,949
so Snowflake is underneath a ton of that

1212
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:46,010
data as well, and we didn't have to build

1213
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,070
a ton of complex infrastructure to do it.

1214
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:50,219
We were able to just icebergify it,

1215
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:50,849
and it worked.

1216
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:51,978
Um,

1217
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,250
and so what that means is that we're actually

1218
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,438
able to serve these things more efficiently.

1219
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,199
We can deliver insights faster,

1220
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,530
and By delivering insights faster, I mean we can spend

1221
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,789
less time figuring out this infrastructure

1222
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,349
and more time actually trying to build insights

1223
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,789
like how's an artist doing? How can we help them. Perform

1224
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:10,039
better where what recommendations can we make?

1225
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:12,719
How do they think about the changing world of

1226
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,918
technology around them? And we don't have to do this

1227
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:16,989
like, oh, I gotta build a whole bunch of

1228
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:19,239
infrastructure to make something just available

1229
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,869
for me to start asking the question,

1230
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,559
the important questions, right?

1231
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:23,570
So,

1232
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,579
um.

1233
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:27,458
I think I'll come back to this

1234
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,750
because this was like the big outcome that we had.

1235
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:32,469
I think what we've managed to achieve, and we're

1236
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:34,469
not, it's not 100% there yet in terms

1237
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,668
of applying to all of our data yet, but for

1238
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:37,869
where we're using this,

1239
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,349
we actually have what I think is genuinely a

1240
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,750
future ready open ecosystem

1241
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,128
that has this

1242
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:46,668
platform engine agnostic

1243
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:47,570
data layer

1244
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,648
that can be accessed from either

1245
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,590
engines we want, even other external

1246
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,969
ones. And that actually

1247
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,250
allows us to basically make our

1248
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,570
huge history of structured data

1249
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,610
available for the next generation of things we're

1250
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,289
doing like our machine learning and AI

1251
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:05,949
because one of the things that structured AI work

1252
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:07,969
has to do is it has to access all of the data that

1253
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:09,250
you have across your organization.

1254
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,878
So if you want to do that, you really want to have your data

1255
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:14,019
in a platform agnostic way

1256
00:43:14,478 --> 00:43:16,878
because our future is going to be multiple

1257
00:43:16,878 --> 00:43:19,039
different, probably like 6 dozen

1258
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:21,320
different engines potentially running different AI

1259
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,458
workloads on things

1260
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,398
and a lot of the business is spinning up work on

1261
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:27,458
AI themselves as well and

1262
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:29,514
and everyone's. Exploring this and so making

1263
00:43:29,514 --> 00:43:31,675
this data available and saying like this is where you get it

1264
00:43:31,793 --> 00:43:33,313
um is really really cool

1265
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:34,494
really important

1266
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:37,074
and so that supports team autonomy while helping

1267
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,074
us to bring a standard that can

1268
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,304
actually work for people right because it's

1269
00:43:41,304 --> 00:43:43,333
hard to push a standard that's not beneficial

1270
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,135
but if everything is really accessible

1271
00:43:45,635 --> 00:43:46,454
pretty obvious benefit.

1272
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,969
Um, OK,

1273
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,128
I think that's it, that's all I had today.

1274
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,728
Alright, yeah, I think that's a wrap.

1275
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:55,369
Thanks everyone, thanks for coming out.
