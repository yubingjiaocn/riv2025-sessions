1
00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:02,119
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,198
So yeah, so like he said, we'll be talking about next-gen

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:07,209
MSPs and how partners

4
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,528
can move from being just maybe a reseller,

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,810
a service provider, all the way to

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,528
become strategic partners.

7
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:17,559
So if we go ahead and we go to the next slide

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,039
here, we can see the agenda.

9
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,478
We'll be going through a few high-level things at the

10
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,879
beginning like the definition, maturity

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,879
model, uh, but we'll also have some call

12
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,500
to actions in here as well.

13
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,670
So AWS, let's start with the basics.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,029
This is how we define managed services,

15
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,270
and it's as the engagement when the partner

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,429
is actively managing AWS

17
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,740
accounts, services, and workloads

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,130
on the customer behalf

19
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,649
and providing them with 24/7 management

20
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:44,639
and support.

21
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,098
And when we look at most of our partners

22
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,840
across the ecos across the

23
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,240
uh industry, we see lots of different

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,348
partners break into different areas.

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
We have the full stack managed service

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,859
provider, but we also have the generalist

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,319
managed service provider.

28
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,939
And usually when we see these full

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,019
stack managed service providers, they

30
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,439
started at that generous level.

31
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,980
Then they started adding 123

32
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,480
things in the full stack area.

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
Then all of a sudden they can do everything in the full stack

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,480
level and they still maintain

35
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,799
and say that the generalist level basically

36
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,799
becomes table stakes. It's just something

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,838
they have to do and they don't even really

38
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:22,799
talk about it anymore.

39
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,579
They're talking about their differentiate offerings, their

40
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,819
industry offerings, their sustainability offerings.

41
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,948
And this ties directly with our customer

42
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:31,459
needs.

43
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:33,888
When we look at what customers say, they

44
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:36,709
say that they are looking for trusted advisors

45
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,168
and by generating these long term agreements

46
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:41,448
with your customers and really building

47
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,489
trust, you as an MSP become

48
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:44,769
that trusted advisor.

49
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,900
They also build everything secure

50
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,168
from the very beginning.

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,859
Everything is scalable from the very beginning.

52
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,778
They have the technical mastery so that customers

53
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:57,019
can ask them any questions and they'll quickly

54
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:57,819
get an answer.

55
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:01,040
And then finally they provide that comprehensive

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,198
protection that can keep customers for a long

57
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:05,269
period of time and allow them to

58
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,359
actually come to you and

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,788
feel comfortable asking and getting improvements

60
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,740
and changes.

61
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,360
When we look at specifically workloads

62
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,960
on the MSP front,

63
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:18,379
we see a drastic change

64
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,399
and growth when it comes to those

65
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,300
workloads.

66
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,819
First, an MSP joins the picture.

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,118
There's a brief stabilization period

68
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:27,210
that you can see at the beginning,

69
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,960
where maybe the MSP reconfigures things,

70
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,599
find out the customer bought wrong things,

71
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,179
things might not have been configured correctly.

72
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,719
After that, that's the first period of

73
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,278
earning trust with that customer.

74
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,419
We now see a period of growth

75
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,909
that can be, OK, now let's scale things up,

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,778
let's get new workloads.

77
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,838
Now, they'll go and continuously optimize.

78
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,240
So once again, there's another reduction in

79
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
spend from that customer standpoint,

80
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,599
so they can earn trust once again with that

81
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,659
customer. Then they

82
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,659
reach operationalized steady state

83
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,819
where now ideally they're spending the exact

84
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:02,629
right amount

85
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:05,300
and now they can go and win another workload

86
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,520
at that same customer.

87
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,659
So they continually do this, they continually

88
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,778
improve these customers' organizations,

89
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,099
basically one workload at a time.

90
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,469
And so when we look at our MSP maturity

91
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:19,588
model, it's a structured framework that will

92
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,770
assess the benchmarks, capabilities,

93
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,288
and performances of the partner.

94
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:27,338
And it's really important because it allows

95
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:29,460
us to create curated enablement.

96
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,050
We've worked with lots of different leaders across

97
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,538
the organization. We've worked with lots of technical

98
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:37,118
folks to create dedicated enablement

99
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,199
for partners in the different stages.

100
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,229
We also can clearly align benefits

101
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,770
to each one of these stages,

102
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,288
and it helps us more easily validate

103
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:46,819
partners,

104
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,110
ideally identify where they

105
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,429
are and provide them with the just in time

106
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:52,409
resources that they need.

107
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,419
So when we look at the maturity model stages,

108
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,169
there's 5 of them. It starts with the early

109
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,490
basic cloud reseller, and it goes

110
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,508
all the way to the strategic partners,

111
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,080
GSIs, who are focused on that digital

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,788
transformation and consulting.

113
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,969
We'll dive a little bit deeper into each one of these,

114
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,520
with the first being that early or that

115
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,879
basic cloud reseller.

116
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,009
They have that ability to do capacity resell.

117
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,649
They do basic account management, billing

118
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,889
support. They don't have any pure

119
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,269
play managed services.

120
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,798
They probably do resold support. Maybe

121
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:28,928
they have one person on the support side

122
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,619
that can answer questions for them.

123
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,720
And really what they're looking for to move

124
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,759
to that next stage is they need

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,619
to start creating that business plan.

126
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,778
Train your team,

127
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,019
build a cloud ops team,

128
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,678
finalize your support offerings on top

129
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:44,559
of resale.

130
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,920
Start hiring a couple of people that can answer

131
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,858
those questions.

132
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,459
Define what your actual target

133
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,059
segment and positioning is

134
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,500
because then that will help you with all of these

135
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,579
different areas.

136
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,160
So we all of these different maturity

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
stages that you'll see are defined

138
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,759
and broken down into really these four

139
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,119
areas that you can focus on as a business

140
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:07,079
to move up to the next stage.

141
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,730
So some key performance indicators

142
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,829
that early stage partners are probably

143
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,850
looking for to move to that emerging

144
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,298
stage that you can track, define, and measure

145
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,108
is what's your AC engagement rate.

146
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,649
So you need to build, maintain your

147
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,790
opportunity pipeline.

148
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,410
As you're going and creating new offerings,

149
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,220
make sure those new offerings are in AWS.

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,048
Launch those opportunities, share those details

151
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,108
because then you'll start coming up for more

152
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,889
service level engagements rather than just the resell

153
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:37,588
engagements.

154
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,660
You as a company should also be looking at what

155
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,019
number of customers have you transitioned? Have

156
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,178
you got them on some sort of basic support

157
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,500
package? Have you got them on basic managed

158
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,278
services?

159
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,730
And then from a customer satisfaction standpoint,

160
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:54,048
what we see as partners go up

161
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:56,649
this maturity model is their satisfaction

162
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,660
rates go up, their retention rates go up.

163
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,988
So it's very, very important that you're tracking these

164
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,470
as well to ensure that you're doing the right things.

165
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,798
The next one is the emerging. This is really

166
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:10,278
the reseller that has support services

167
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:12,019
or lightweight services.

168
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,439
So of course they still have that capability to do

169
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,178
the resell,

170
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,519
but now they've gone as far as gotten a

171
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,000
service offering foundational technical

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,858
review approved.

173
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,798
So they have that validation from AWS.

174
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,470
They have limited support services,

175
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,829
primarily we see it around backup,

176
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,230
disaster recovery,

177
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,980
firewall security.

178
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,798
And it becomes about a transaction-based

179
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,920
relationship. We're gonna go, we're gonna

180
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
bring you on board, we'll get you everything

181
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,959
set up, and now we're gonna stand back and

182
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,278
we're gonna let you call us if any problems actually

183
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,790
come up. What

184
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,939
we want to see as you're moving up

185
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,329
to the next stage is actually expanding

186
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,509
to a horizontal support

187
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,699
model, actually going and

188
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,588
starting to build some automation and tooling.

189
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,028
If you don't build the automation

190
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:01,428
tooling at this level, you're gonna continually

191
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,230
struggle as you move up the stack.

192
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,988
As you get more customers, more complicated

193
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:08,048
customers, you are going to struggle

194
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,178
being able to handle that number of tickets

195
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:10,869
that you'll get

196
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,149
or those solutions that need to be done.

197
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,238
And then continue with the staff development.

198
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,649
Maybe those people in the beginning were just doing

199
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,869
those level one tickets. This is an

200
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,629
opportunity that you can begin upskilling them.

201
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,389
We have a AWS managed services

202
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,329
training course now

203
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,709
with a badge that partners can have

204
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,750
and take and use it to upskill

205
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,790
their teams and have them grow to be

206
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,488
ready to provide those extra level of services.

207
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,199
When we're looking at KPIs from this standpoint,

208
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,329
we start looking at now what does

209
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,358
your managed services revenue look

210
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:45,569
like? What sort of customers

211
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,790
do you have on a recurring revenue stream

212
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,069
instead of maybe a yearly revenue stream?

213
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,850
What sort of service adoption and coverage

214
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,569
do you have?

215
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,048
Are you going upselling customers from

216
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:58,230
maybe your basic package to now your

217
00:07:58,488 --> 00:07:59,709
services package?

218
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,449
And then of course maintain the operation

219
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,730
side of the business so you're prepared as

220
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,548
you continue to gain more customers.

221
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,079
If your SLAs start to suffer,

222
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,250
you need to figure that process out.

223
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,129
You need to automate more things.

224
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:15,649
So it's very, very important that all of these

225
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,689
different levers are balanced so you're

226
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,910
prepared to continually grow your business.

227
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,428
Then we move to the established

228
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,088
and the and the established partners

229
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,488
are services partners with a horizontal

230
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:30,629
based managed services offering

231
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:33,678
so to work across all industries primarily

232
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,308
focused on infrastructure

233
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,048
and this is when customers start

234
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:40,090
feeling like the MSP is

235
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,849
their own IT shop.

236
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,279
You are an extension of their business,

237
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,408
and this is where we really start seeing

238
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:48,149
the retention rates increase.

239
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,719
They have well-defined automation. They

240
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:53,149
have well-defined ITSM processes.

241
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,460
And these are the partners that we look for

242
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,599
that are in our managed service provider

243
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,379
program today.

244
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,090
As you're moving up, this is what we're

245
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,210
looking for. We're looking for partners to start

246
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,359
adding things like Gen AI data

247
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,379
and analytics.

248
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,168
We want them to deepen their automation.

249
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,830
We want them to start thinking about

250
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,399
industry, vertical solutions,

251
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,849
where is your customer base that you've acquired

252
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,899
so far? Double down, triple

253
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,450
down in those areas and start developing

254
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,129
specific offerings for that.

255
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,369
Then also specialize in industry regulations.

256
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,840
Industry regulations is very, very

257
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,200
complicated, and depending on the segment

258
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,279
that you're working with, this can be an

259
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,000
extremely large value add to help them navigate

260
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,849
that regulatory environment

261
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,700
and then ultimately offer

262
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,739
compliance as a service to those customers.

263
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,599
When we move into this area, we're looking at

264
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,979
how can you expand the service portfolio,

265
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
how much are you leveraging AI and

266
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,279
automation,

267
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,918
and how well are you upskilling

268
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,739
your talent,

269
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,479
because at this level you want to continually

270
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,840
upskill so you're always on the forefront

271
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,719
of technology.

272
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,739
The last thing that you want is when you're building

273
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,779
that trusted advisor relationship with your

274
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:08,519
customers,

275
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,940
something new comes out, they call and

276
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,239
they want it and you say, we don't know how to do that.

277
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,788
That's the last thing that you want because now

278
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,820
that customer will start going and looking

279
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,859
for someone that can, and then that can be

280
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,038
a slippery slope where they start moving

281
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,700
everything to them.

282
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:25,279
So that upskilling of talent is extremely,

283
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:26,460
extremely important.

284
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,229
And the final one is the market leader.

285
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,629
And the market leader typically goes to market

286
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,690
with a solution-based approach.

287
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,229
They have cloud native development,

288
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,729
they do management of business

289
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:41,830
applications, and they can fully

290
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,548
handle governance, risk, and compliance.

291
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,158
And so they really are transforming

292
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,408
into a full level or full stack

293
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:51,250
MSP

294
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,369
where they can create tailored solutions for industries.

295
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,788
They co-innovate with AWS.

296
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,330
They really shape the industry direction

297
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,469
with AWS

298
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:03,009
and they even start moving into areas

299
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,048
like sustainability, green IT

300
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:05,808
solutions,

301
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,168
and they continue to push their market

302
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,168
leadership through those white papers and best

303
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:10,950
practices.

304
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,129
For the market leader

305
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,750
partners, we're looking at them to

306
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,629
go and show us their digital transformation

307
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,629
impact. How many strategic

308
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,190
digital projects have you done?

309
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:26,548
What does your industry and vertical solution

310
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:28,769
strategy, specialization look like?

311
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,469
And also we're looking at innovation and

312
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:32,649
IP creation.

313
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:35,109
How much are you reinvesting as a company

314
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,229
to go and develop new solutions, new

315
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:37,950
areas,

316
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:40,469
uh, new modernization techniques, and

317
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:41,889
new AI techniques?

318
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,690
Then, sorry,

319
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,349
I actually I have one more, the strategic, the strategic

320
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:49,450
is the industry technology partners

321
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,009
or the GSI's

322
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,619
who go a step further in that

323
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,690
industry thought leadership, and they have

324
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,788
a global reach and global

325
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,288
delivery capabilities.

326
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:02,379
They focus on outcome-based engagements

327
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,389
rather than just 1 to 1 or

328
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,769
service level baseline engagements.

329
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,940
They actually go up above and beyond and establish

330
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,009
these innovation labs. They invest heavily in

331
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,619
ROI R&D.

332
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,139
They partner directly with the C-suite to

333
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,298
guide the transformation strategy,

334
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:20,739
and they maintain a robust pipeline

335
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,820
of customer case studies across all

336
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,239
of the different industries.

337
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,070
And this is all important because what

338
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,750
we see is we see that profitability

339
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,750
increases as you move up each of

340
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,769
these stages.

341
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,548
So MSP revenue really does

342
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,389
grow with this advancement.

343
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,308
So starting with that baseline generalist,

344
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,649
we actually see about $2.50

345
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,389
revenue multiplier

346
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:48,029
for those generalist MSPs,

347
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,609
and they earn about 25 to 30%

348
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:51,489
gross profit.

349
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,109
As you move up to that next gen MSP,

350
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,379
we now see them start unlocking a

351
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,700
$4.90

352
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,000
revenue multiplier or 55%

353
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,080
gross profit.

354
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,739
So going and moving up that stack

355
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,859
is very, very integral for your

356
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,320
business to be able to

357
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,739
provide you that foundation to say this is

358
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:14,099
what we're working toward and tell business

359
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:16,139
leaders this is what we're going to unlock

360
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,298
once we have these capabilities, and

361
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,229
this is why we should invest in there.

362
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,719
And we actually partnered with a

363
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,298
BCG consulting group

364
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:28,158
and we created an ROI assessment

365
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,558
tool that can help partners like yourself determine

366
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:31,298
where you are

367
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,000
and this data comes from them on why

368
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,658
investing in AWS MSP capabilities

369
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,808
is one of the most financially attractive opportunities

370
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,440
for partners in the services market.

371
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,489
Our analysis shows that approximately,

372
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,950
oops. Our analysis

373
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,428
shows that our participants

374
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,869
received about a 3 to 4 times return

375
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:54,168
on investment over 5 years.

376
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,168
So that ROI was really

377
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,469
driven because of the recurring revenue streams

378
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:00,389
that they unlocked,

379
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,168
the automation efficiencies that they unlocked.

380
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,788
And what's particularly attractive is the 2

381
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:07,649
to 3 year payback period,

382
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,048
meaning that you'll see positive returns

383
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,969
well before the 5 year mark.

384
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,308
And so as you can see here, we

385
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,529
also see long term value created,

386
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:19,548
we see the valuation range, so we

387
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:21,590
have lots of good data that all can be

388
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,250
leveraged when you're having those C-level

389
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,349
conversations about why we need to invest

390
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,580
and change and grow into an MSP

391
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,250
partner

392
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,048
and a couple that, like I mentioned, we have a

393
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,428
uh analysis tool that can also help

394
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,288
you with this.

395
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,139
Let me leave you with 3 concrete

396
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,690
steps to accelerate your NP journey with AWS.

397
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:43,440
First,

398
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,139
go ahead and assess your current state.

399
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,759
Whether you're just starting out or you're

400
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,879
already established, you need to

401
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,000
clearly understand exactly

402
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,979
where you are in your MSP journey.

403
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,639
This isn't about just checking boxes. It's not

404
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,879
about lying or cheating on the test

405
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,139
to make yourself look better

406
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:03,678
for your C level. It's about understanding

407
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:05,678
clearly where you are so you have a

408
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:06,960
place to go in the future.

409
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,950
Next, invest in their future.

410
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,450
Once you identify what your stage

411
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,200
is, build an investment plan.

412
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,609
Decide how much we're going to invest, where

413
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,750
we wanna be in 3 to 5 years,

414
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,048
and we can help you on that journey

415
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:23,489
as well on what different components

416
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:25,690
we need to help you. We can provide you

417
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,308
resources,

418
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,408
and it could mean anything from developing new capabilities,

419
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,038
upskilling your current team,

420
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,500
hiring new people,

421
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,769
but every dollar invested

422
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,570
should align with your growth strategy.

423
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,509
Then finally connect with the AWS MSP

424
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,820
team. We have things like accelerated

425
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,019
MSP build workshop. We have other

426
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,279
resources that can leverage.

427
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:47,349
I'm here.

428
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,859
Bapa is back there, our technical lead,

429
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,379
so we're both here that we can help out with any

430
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,538
questions that you might have.

431
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you very much and I'll be around as well for

432
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,369
any other questions that you might have.
