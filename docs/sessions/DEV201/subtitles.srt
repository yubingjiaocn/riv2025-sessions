1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,150
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,230
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,300
Good. Okay, perfect.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,300
So I think it's time and we
should start this presentation.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,600
So, first of all, thank you
so much for joining me today.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,970
I really hope you're having a great start

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,080
to this conference.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,820
I know it's the first day,

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,310
and today actually I'm
very excited to share

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,470
something that brings together

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,420
two of my favorite things.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,800
First is gaming.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,570
So I am from gaming domain,

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,510
and I've worked in gaming
domain for the last seven years.

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,230
And the second is applied generative AI.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,450
This is one domain where most of us

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,463
are quite curious nowadays.

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,677
So the title of my session is

19
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,750
"GenAI game coach: Real-time
gameplay feedback."

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,890
And the big idea behind it
is actually very simple.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,180
So, in this talk, we'll
explore an imagination where

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,340
you have your gameplay clips,

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,070
and we are imagining
if your gameplay clips

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,120
could talk back to you

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,910
and tell you exactly how to improve,

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,260
if you like gaming, if
you're into video games.

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,820
But the other aspect of this talk

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,800
is we are not going to talk about SDKs.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,880
We are not going to talk about
some game engine plugins.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,450
We are actually going to
take a raw gameplay video,

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,090
and we'll use AWS-powered offerings

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,570
to see how we can build
an intelligent agent

33
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,150
that will guide us and act like a coach

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,040
looking over our shoulders

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,623
when we are playing a game online.

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,630
So before I get into this talk,

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,570
I'll give a brief
introduction about myself.

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,740
My name is Gaganjot,

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,450
and everyone calls me Gagan.

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,490
So I go by Gagan.

41
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,820
I am currently working for
Sony Interactive Entertainment,

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,690
which is basically the
gaming division of Sony,

43
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,550
known for PlayStation.

44
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,120
I have been with PlayStation
for almost seven years now,

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,430
and I work as a staff software engineer.

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,470
My focus is backend engineering

47
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,180
and I've worked in different domains,

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,680
started from personalization,

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,900
and then jumped into cloud streaming,

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,040
and my most recent is AI enablement space.

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,380
So I'm actually very
passionate about experimenting

52
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,410
with GenAI for gameplay,
for developer tools,

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,820
for interactive intelligence.

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,220
And this talk is one of those experiments

55
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,220
which turned into a super fun prototype.

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,810
So, we have a limited time,

57
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,910
but I'll try to go over a couple of things

58
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,400
in this next couple of minutes.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,230
So, on a high level, we'll talk about

60
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,160
what is the skill improvement
demand in the gaming industry.

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,440
Why are players struggling?

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,820
Then we'll look into how
generative AI can help players

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,633
make sense of fast or chaotic combat.

64
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,300
And then finally, I'll show
you an AWS-powered architecture

65
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,930
where we are going to look
into different offerings,

66
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,590
but mainly focusing on
Amazon Bedrock and AgentCore,

67
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,773
which basically orchestrates
the entire coaching workflow.

68
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,510
And I'll also show you a de
demo video of what I built,

69
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,410
what it looks like,

70
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,310
what is the coach built using AWS

71
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,250
say about a sample clip
that I'll show to you.

72
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,680
And finally I'll wrap it up.

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,740
But if you're interested to
continue this discussion,

74
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,190
if you have more ideas,
definitely let's catch up.

75
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,160
Once this talk is done,
please meet me afterwards

76
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,220
and I would be very happy
to take your questions

77
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,263
and your further ideas in this area.

78
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,373
So let's get started.

79
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,970
I think the very first thing is

80
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,620
I would basically like to talk about

81
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,110
a scenario where you're imagining

82
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,737
that you're playing "Spider-Man."

83
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:56,400
"Spider-Man" is one of my favorite games.

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,440
And you're swim swinging
through Manhattan,

85
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
chasing a group of thugs,

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,750
and one brute suddenly charges at you.

87
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,300
A sniper laser lines up from a rooftop,

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,353
and you get hit.

89
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,347
In that moment, what you think is,

90
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,950
"I reacted on time and I
did all the right things,

91
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,507
but I still got hit."

92
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,450
But if you think about a game which is

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,550
a "Spider-Man" style combat,

94
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,850
it's a very fast and chaotic combat.

95
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,120
Human reaction time is
usually 250 milliseconds,

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,370
but these telegraphed attacks resolve

97
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,430
in 100 to 150 milliseconds seconds.

98
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,310
So this mismatch of timing means

99
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,310
most of the players cannot
even see their own mistakes.

100
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,890
So the scope of improvement is very less

101
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,140
because you don't even
know what you did wrong,

102
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,013
what was the move which
caused you this kind of hit.

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,860
And this is not just "Spider-Man."

104
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,690
This can be actually imagined about

105
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,033
most of the games in the gaming world.

106
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,900
So, looking at some studies,

107
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,690
I've seen most of the
players actually misdiagnose

108
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,423
their own mistakes in a video game.

109
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,770
And that's where we have some challenges,

110
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,000
we have some opportunities,

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,520
and we have a potential solution.

112
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,400
So talking about the challenge,

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,530
like I said, gameplay is chaotic.

114
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,780
Players don't know what went wrong,

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,440
and a mistimed dodge
happens in 150 milliseconds.

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,050
A wrong rotation decision
happens in half a second.

117
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,760
So there is a complete mismatch of time

118
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,220
between the player's response

119
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,443
versus how the game is responding.

120
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,950
And raw gameplay is actually very noisy.

121
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,190
Most skill mistakes happen
far too fast for players

122
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,413
to even break down on their own.

123
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,200
So that's where we have the opportunity.

124
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,570
We have millions of players
who want to get better.

125
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,370
They don't have coaches

126
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,110
and they don't want to invest their money

127
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,740
into these expensive tools
or expensive softwares,

128
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,320
which could be also complex to understand.

129
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,730
Even studios don't want
to in huge GPU clusters

130
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,493
to build some scalable analysis.

131
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,280
So that's where we are going
to imagine about a solution

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,460
because this is where GenAI can shine.

133
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,160
So what if your gameplay could talk back?

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,830
And what if you had a personal AI coach

135
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,190
that understands timing,
movement, and decisions

136
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,753
just from a short clip?

137
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,650
So that's where we are headed.

138
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,390
But before we get into the
actual stuff that I built,

139
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,380
I wanted to show you a sample game clip.

140
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,690
It's a long clip so I'm not
going to show the entire clip,

141
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,990
but it's relevant because this is the clip

142
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,800
which I used for actually
performing my demo

143
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,220
or actually building the
website and analyzing this clip.

144
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,600
This is a game clip
which is 578 MB in size

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,870
and the duration is roughly five minutes,

146
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,700
but there is like a lot of action,

147
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,130
a lot of movement happening in this clip,

148
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,290
and a lot of things happening.

149
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,170
So I'm going to play it for a few minutes

150
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,843
to show you what this clip is all about.

151
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,270
And afterwards, in the demo, you'll see

152
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,360
what the coach that I built using AWS

153
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,070
had to say about this clip

154
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,983
and what could be improved by this player.

155
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,360
Anyways, I'll go on to the next slide

156
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,870
because I just wanted to give
you a glimpse of this video

157
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,330
that I used for my analysis.

158
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,660
So now comes the AI-powered
architectural solution.

159
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,610
So before we jump into the demo,

160
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,880
I just wanted to show
you a high level flow of

161
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,070
what my architecture looks like.

162
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,230
So let's just start at the very beginning.

163
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,840
We have a user interface.

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,390
User interface is basically

165
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,090
where the user will input a clip.

166
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,030
So you need an interface
where you capture the clip,

167
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,330
maybe five minutes, 10
minutes, whatever long clip,

168
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,100
and you want to upload it.

169
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,510
So this is an interface.

170
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,560
It's a simple react based
single page application

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
which is delivered globally
using Amazon CloudFront,

172
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,570
so that's the CDN layer,

173
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,783
which will ensure low-latency
access for players anywhere.

174
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,070
And not only you will upload the clip,

175
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,880
you can also actually see the
analysis report on this UI.

176
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,010
Also, it has another functionality

177
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,910
where you can trigger an
actual conversational agent

178
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,810
which can talk to you and give you

179
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,463
suggestions on the areas that
you need suggestions for.

180
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,470
So from the next layer,

181
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,080
we go onto the API layer.

182
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,290
So this clip actually
goes into S3 storage.

183
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,930
So when you click upload button,

184
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,790
it will, basically, behind the scenes...

185
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,230
We have two kinds of gateways.

186
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,700
We have API gateway or Lambda URL function

187
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
which will perform different functions.

188
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,830
So API gateway actually provides
you different endpoints,

189
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,750
like there is an endpoint

190
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,090
to get the upload URL of your S3 bucket

191
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,000
where this clip is getting uploaded.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
There is an URL analyze endpoint

193
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,000
which can basically
trigger the analysis by AI.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,860
And there is also a chat endpoint

195
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,030
which will trigger your chat

196
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,033
when when you want to
chat with the AI agent.

197
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,203
On the other hand, I also
have Lambda URL function.

198
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,720
The purpose of this is actually
for bigger size videos.

199
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,260
I was actually hitting
timeouts on API gateway,

200
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,230
so the default timeout is 30 seconds.

201
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,080
But for Lambda, you can
actually increase this timeout.

202
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,230
So for bigger videos, it's
better to actually use Lambda

203
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,400
instead of using API
gateway to upload a video,

204
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,733
get the URL, and send it for the analysis.

205
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,533
So this is what the API layer
looks like on a high level.

206
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,600
Next comes the compute layer.

207
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,650
So, compute layer is basically
the different Lambdas

208
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,350
which this application is using.

209
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,660
On a high level, there are three
different types of lambdas.

210
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,190
So there is analysis
Lambda which basically

211
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,770
is used for generating
the S3 pre-signed URLs

212
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,240
for video upload,

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,900
and then it will process
your video from S3.

214
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,760
Next is the chat handler Lambda

215
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,130
which basically receives the chat messages

216
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,390
from the front end.

217
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,550
It invokes Bedrock
agent behind the scenes,

218
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,820
and then it gives you the
results on the front end.

219
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,370
And last is the agent action Lambda

220
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,400
which basically is used for executing

221
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,713
Bedrock agent action group functions.

222
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,540
And this use case that I built,

223
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,550
I've used it for just for myself.

224
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,380
But even if you want to have

225
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,720
multiple users hitting your website,

226
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,360
the Lambda is scalable.

227
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,820
There will be multiple
instances of Lambda coming up

228
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,920
if you have multiple users

229
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,503
trying to upload video on this website.

230
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,750
The storage is S3,

231
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,423
and the final is the AI/ML layer.

232
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,890
So there are a bunch of
things here in this layer.

233
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,200
We see there is Amazon Bedrock.

234
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,780
So there are two kinds of ways in which

235
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,200
I was basically using Bedrock.

236
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,500
So first is I just give my direct video

237
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,470
to one of the models that
I selected on Bedrock.

238
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,820
Bedrock gives you access to

239
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,660
a variety of different LLM models.

240
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,710
So I used Amazon Nova Pro which
can directly take a video,

241
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,150
and it can analyze your video

242
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,500
and understand what is
happening in this video.

243
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,230
The other area which I
built in this application

244
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,260
is using AgentCore, which gives you

245
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,010
a facility to build a production
grade agentic platform.

246
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,420
So it takes care of the memory.

247
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,080
It takes care of any kind of networking

248
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,610
that you wanna build,

249
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,410
but essentially I used it to build

250
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,660
an interactive coaching chat.

251
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,220
So there will be a two-way communication.

252
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,720
You can ask questions,

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,580
and your chat is also getting stored.

254
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,363
So it also retains the
history of what you talked.

255
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,640
The other parallel analysis
that happens behind the scenes

256
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,620
is using Amazon recognition,

257
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,420
which is for computer vision.

258
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,180
So this analysis helps us to identify

259
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,123
what are the different
objects in a given clip,

260
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:38,763
what the scene could be
about, what is the text.

261
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,080
If your video has speech like you are

262
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,940
saying certain things
while playing the game

263
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,700
and you capture that video,
you can actually have

264
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,330
a speech to text transcription
using Amazon Transcribe,

265
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,730
which is another parallel
analysis that gets triggered.

266
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,070
And the last one is Amazon Comprehend

267
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,830
which basically does
the sentiment analysis

268
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,063
of the entire clip.

269
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,000
So this is what, on high level,

270
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,400
what the different components look like.

271
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,780
I also wanted to quickly show you

272
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,140
the prompts which I used for this.

273
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,270
So prompts are very important.

274
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,060
Behind the scenes, you can
have different personas

275
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,710
for your agent.

276
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,150
This agent is a coach.

277
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,320
What kind of coach you want?

278
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,790
Do you want a supportive coach?

279
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,980
You want a coach that is motivating

280
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,010
and saying friendly things

281
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,960
or you want to coach,
which is very competitive

282
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,550
and really giving or grilling a player.

283
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,560
That will very highly
depend on the prompt.

284
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,630
So the kind of language generated

285
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,300
in terms of the
suggestions from your coach

286
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,000
would actually be dependent on
the kind of prompts you give.

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,970
So, as an example, I've given...

288
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,550
You're an expert gaming coach
with years of experience

289
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,560
helping players improve their skills.

290
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,510
You have access to the player's
gameplay, blah, blah, blah.

291
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,770
But I've also told it be conversational,

292
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,970
friendly, and motivating.

293
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,030
You are here to help
them level up their game.

294
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,640
So this is like the detailed prompts

295
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,173
I gave for different personas.

296
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,023
Moving on.

297
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,513
I wanted to actually show you
a quick video if it plays.

298
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,110
But yeah, this is a demo of the video

299
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,590
which basically takes this same video

300
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,660
that I showed you earlier.

301
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,340
And as soon as I click
the start AI analysis,

302
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,190
it basically runs behind the scenes.

303
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,653
It's uploading your video to S3.

304
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,680
The Lambda will trigger all kinds of

305
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,750
AI analysis on your video,

306
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,200
and it will basically
generate you the report of

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,393
what are the suggestions provided.

308
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,170
So, what I noticed,

309
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,090
one of the challenges
I noticed was it takes

310
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,733
a very long time to upload it to S3,

311
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,483
and that's where it's kind
of taking most of the time,

312
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,410
but I wanted to actually
forward it and show you

313
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,430
the actual prompts

314
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:10,953
or the actual results which
came from this analysis.

315
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,310
So you can see there is
computer vision analysis,

316
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,960
which comes from recognition,

317
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,550
which shows there's a person,

318
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,163
there's a road, there's
weapon, there's gun.

319
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,850
This is the AI gameplay analysis,

320
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,553
which comes from the Nova Pro model.

321
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
There's a lot of analysis but
it basically recognizes...

322
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,910
This video shows a player navigating

323
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,070
various environments in "Destiny 2,"

324
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,830
engaging in combat with enemies.

325
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,750
And then if you see player performance,

326
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,310
that's where it tells

327
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,140
there are moments where the player

328
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,660
could improve in terms
of situational awareness

329
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,253
and enemy engagement.

330
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,710
But at the same time, if you see the tone,

331
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,890
it's very friendly and
it's very motivating.

332
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,510
The player's gameplay is commendable,

333
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,900
especially in terms of
aiming and cover usage.

334
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,020
So this is a high level AI analysis.

335
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,510
And then there is overall assessment,

336
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,880
there is sentiment analysis,

337
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,880
and also wanted to quickly
show you the coach.

338
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,620
So, in the end, there is also a button

339
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,660
where you can actually trigger this coach.

340
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,860
So there are also some custom
prompts for this coach.

341
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,660
So you can select one of those prompts

342
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,300
or you can actually
frame your own question.

343
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,950
But if you select one of those prompts,

344
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,740
it will basically generate
the question on its own.

345
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,680
So for example, if you select
Analyze My Performance,

346
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,570
it will basically create the question

347
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,710
that, hey, can you give
me a detailed breakdown

348
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,423
of how my performance was?

349
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,490
So this is the screenshot of the demos

350
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,430
that I actually wanted
to show in the video,

351
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,920
but it's not forwarding.

352
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,413
So I just showed you in the screenshots.

353
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,230
So I think, the next,

354
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,290
I just wanted to quickly
touch on the cost side.

355
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,310
For my use case, I used all
these different offerings

356
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,230
and the total cost for this one video,

357
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,993
which is five minutes long, was $0.9.

358
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,920
Of course, once you build
something at a production level,

359
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,690
you have to take into consideration

360
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,720
how many concurrent users
are in your environment,

361
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,760
how frequently you want
to do this analysis,

362
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,890
and how big would be the video size

363
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,140
that you're dealing with.

364
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,300
So yeah, for a casual gamer,

365
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,080
if I have five videos per
month, it will be $50 per year,

366
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,080
or for 20 videos per month, it
would $235 per year roughly.

367
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,030
Latency analysis.

368
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,860
The latency, like I said,

369
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,480
it did take a lot of time to upload.

370
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,520
It almost takes eight minutes to upload.

371
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,480
So this is one area

372
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,240
where I would like to improve it further.

373
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,430
The AI analysis is still pretty good.

374
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,720
It takes almost two minutes

375
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,033
to finish the entire parallel analysis.

376
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,930
So the total time is roughly 10 minutes

377
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,100
for this five-minute long
video for this entire analysis

378
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,550
with the report that you get.

379
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,030
I think, lessons learned,
I kind of already

380
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,440
touched on few of those things,

381
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,300
hitting the limits of
the size of the video,

382
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,950
and then figuring out what
is the other way for me to

383
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,350
pass on these videos to models like Nova.

384
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,820
So, for Nova, the limit
that you get is one GB.

385
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,560
And if you're uploading it on S3,

386
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,343
you can actually upload
a video as big as one GB.

387
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,940
And the other thing I
wanted to point out was

388
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,763
I did not have to do any
kind of frame extraction.

389
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,050
Nova recognition, as long as
you've uploaded them on S3,

390
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,140
they're taking care of
extracting the frames on its own.

391
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,720
As far as I understand,
Nova is basically doing

392
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,940
intelligence sampling behind the scenes.

393
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,863
So that was all taken care of.

394
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,900
What's next?

395
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,090
So, basically, like I said,

396
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,610
I would like to work
on the latency aspect,

397
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,320
would like to reduce it from 10 minutes

398
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,990
to at least make it near real time.

399
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,330
I would also like to
explore video compression

400
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,010
and caching technologies

401
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,383
to improve the overall latency and cost.

402
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,280
The other area where this
would be very useful is

403
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,200
for the live streaming platforms

404
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,370
because there is a lot of players

405
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,900
who actually stream their videos

406
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,230
on platforms like Twitch or YouTube.

407
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,220
Can we analyze it

408
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,100
and can we build this conversational thing

409
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,140
as and when the players are playing?

410
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,660
So those are the areas where I want to

411
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,883
explore these things in future,

412
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,590
but with that, I would like
to share some of the links.

413
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,470
So there is a GitHub repo where
I have put this entire code

414
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,573
with instructions on how to run it.

415
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,180
You can connect with me on LinkedIn

416
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,190
if you want to continue this discussion

417
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,173
even after this conference.

418
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,740
But yeah, that is all from my side,

419
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,490
and thank you so much for
coming to the session,

420
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,920
And I see that I'm right on time.

421
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,460
But if you have any questions,
please meet me afterwards,

422
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,983
and I'm more than happy
to chat with you all.

423
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,310
And with that, thank you so much.

424
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,023
Have a great rest of your day.
