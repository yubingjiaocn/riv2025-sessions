1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
- Welcome.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,790
I'm Olen Ronning

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,261
and I am a Director of
Product at Smartsheet

4
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:07,990
and I'm gonna be talking
about how we're bringing AI

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,660
to increase visibility

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,997
into your Project and
Portfolio Management.

7
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:14,640
Before we dive into all of
that, just a quick intro.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,953
Who the heck is Olen?
Kind of by the numbers.

9
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:19,082
I've been at Smartsheet for six years

10
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,751
and I've spent a bunch of time in product.

11
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,966
Before that, I was a designer.

12
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,950
And I studied a combination

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,390
of Computer Science and Industrial Design.

14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,010
And I still scratch the itch

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,429
on industrial design
once a year for Halloween

16
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:35,280
and build these kind of displays
of different movie themes.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,044
Can anyone guess what this movie theme is

18
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:39,693
for this year's Halloween?

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,633
Hear it?

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,070
Louder. "Tron."

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,540
Yes indeed. It's "Tron."

22
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,020
So, I use this, a note
from before where I,

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,210
I love this quote from
Steve Jobs he used to,

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,046
said many years ago of he saw computers

25
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:57,120
as a bicycle for the mind.

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,120
And I think about AI is like
a lightcycle for the mind.

27
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,020
It's just gonna go so much faster

28
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,900
and get you even farther than ever before.

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,980
So, let's talk a little bit

30
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,084
about how does that apply to portfolios?

31
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:15,420
How many people here are
managing projects or portfolios?

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,353
Show of hands.

33
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,903
Okay, cool.

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,890
How many, I'm gonna ask you,

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,840
if you look across your portfolio,

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,230
I'm using this frame of
seeing into the void, right?

37
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,550
There's so much out there.

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,320
When you think about
managing those projects,

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,940
managing those portfolios,

40
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,370
how many of these things
resonate with you?

41
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,270
Anybody? Is it?

42
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,798
Does this resonate in terms of issues

43
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,440
and things that you're trying to do?

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,000
Is there something that's not on this list

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
that should be on this list?

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,760
Yeah? Kinda matches.

47
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,790
Again, kinda side head nods.

48
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,300
So, what we're thinking
about is how can we leverage

49
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,473
the power of work management
tools coupled with AI

50
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:02,473
to make it so much easier to
get to those insights faster

51
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:06,150
and ahead of time, and more proactively

52
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,533
rather than reactively.

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,950
And so, when we think about like,

54
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,980
what are the specific challenges
related to the ability

55
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,680
to kind of dig up those
insights, identify risks?

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,760
There's a couple different factors

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,170
that come into play there.

58
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,001
So, one is obviously
the lack of visibility.

59
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,291
And that visibility is both into,

60
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,440
like, what's going on in the work,

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,910
what's the current status of it,

62
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,720
who's working on what, what
are the resourcing availability

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,330
of the teams to do the work
that we're trying to do?

64
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,970
And having to constantly
do all those things

65
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,080
we just saw on the last slide

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,450
where we're trying to hunt
down the different updates

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,830
and statuses and things like that.

68
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,050
It means that you're working off of data

69
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,964
that's not up-to-date or
you're constantly spending

70
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,770
a bunch of time tracking it down,

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,920
and then you're missing
risks and work gets delayed,

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,460
and the actions to mitigate
those risks come too late

73
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,610
before they can actually
have an impact, right?

74
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,550
The other thing that we see is
that a lot of people who are,

75
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,930
maybe this resonates with you

76
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,067
where you're managing a portfolio,

77
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,024
you have a lot of processes

78
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,710
that map into that portfolio, right?

79
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,420
So, you have work that's coming in.

80
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,744
You need to triage or manage that process

81
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:12,030
or go through an approval process.

82
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,400
And that requires a lot of human oversight

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,740
and manual processing and manual checks.

84
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,210
And that's just a lot of time

85
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,080
that you're spending to do that.

86
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,880
And that's the time that
you're not spending,

87
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,880
actually doing the project
delivery work, right?

88
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,790
It is extra time that gets consumed

89
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,600
and you're not being able
to maximize your capacity.

90
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,390
And speaking of capacity,
if you think about,

91
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,930
if you're, I've talked to
a lot of customers where,

92
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,910
actually I was just on a call
earlier today with a customer

93
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,710
where they had three project managers.

94
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,900
And how many projects do
you think they're managing

95
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,213
at a time across three project managers?

96
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,710
200 projects across
three project managers.

97
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,740
So, their life is just constantly looking

98
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,240
at all these projects, right?

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,500
And so, we see this
opportunity to use Agentic AI

100
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,390
to be able to scale your workforce.

101
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,437
If you can do all of those things

102
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:03,150
you just saw on the previous slide,

103
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,820
if those things are
happening in the background,

104
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,650
then you can scale out.

105
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,728
You can actually manage
such a large portfolio

106
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,880
with a smaller workforce, right?

107
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,370
And you can then begin
to take on more work

108
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,353
and scale out your capacity.

109
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,100
So, that's what we see as the opportunity.

110
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,640
That you can go from
getting those insights

111
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,490
and that those insights
then drive specific actions

112
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,750
that you can perform.

113
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,583
And those actions

114
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,090
are not just necessarily
things that you are doing,

115
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,650
but you can actually then have the AI

116
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,903
perform those actions on your behalf.

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
And then, the second part
is by being able to apply AI

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,654
to those automations, to those workflows,

119
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:43,080
you can scale your productivity.

120
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,660
So, you're spending less time
doing those manual checks,

121
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,494
manual approvals, manual triage,

122
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:51,210
or having a human at
different stages of a process.

123
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,400
You can automate the
entire end-to-end workflow

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,510
and save time.

125
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,475
And like I said, scaling
out your workforce

126
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,710
by having these agents that are performing

127
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,630
a lot of these duties on your behalf

128
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,301
and you basically have doubled or tripled

129
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:05,010
or quadrupled each
project manager's capacity

130
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,603
within your organization.

131
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,170
So in the end, what this really means

132
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,521
is with all of this data, if
you can't see what's going on,

133
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,990
you're not gonna be able to manage it.

134
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,310
And so, our mission here

135
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,130
is to give you that insight so that this,

136
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,310
through a project management
tool powered by AI,

137
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,759
you have that broader horizon view

138
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,620
out across everything that's going on.

139
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,223
Not only current state, but
past and predictive future.

140
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,455
So, let's talk a little bit
about what that looks like.

141
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:40,380
We are calling this
Intelligent Work Management.

142
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,520
And it's an evolution of when we think

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,110
about collaborative work management.

144
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,353
It is intelligent and powered
by AI at the very core.

145
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,350
And to support that at
the foundation is data.

146
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,790
You have to have really good data.

147
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,340
And a collaborative work
management tool like Smartsheet

148
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,100
is a place where you can have
that shared source of truth,

149
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,200
whether you're managing
projects directly in it

150
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,670
or you're integrating with other tools

151
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,590
or bringing in tickets from Jira,

152
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,700
or whatever other tools you're using

153
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,710
for managing kind of day-to-day work,

154
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,030
that you have this source of truth

155
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,530
where you're getting a sense of everything

156
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,090
that's going on with the portfolio.

157
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,750
And we are building, have
built a knowledge graph

158
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,000
on top of that data that
you have in Smartsheet.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,732
And what that knowledge
graph does is it analyzes

160
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,624
the connections between the people

161
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:25,890
and the content and the work,
and uses those relationships

162
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,863
to provide powerful context for the AI.

163
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,830
So, today in Smartsheet there are a number

164
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,780
of AI capabilities we
have already launched.

165
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,270
And so if you are currently a
customer, any show of hands,

166
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,910
is anyone currently a
customer of Smartsheet?

167
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay, a couple.

168
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,080
You don't count. (laughs)

169
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,571
So, you have these abilities
to use natural language

170
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,360
to generate really powerful formulas

171
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,180
that can calculate different
things like budgets and risks.

172
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,550
You can generate charts
by asking it questions

173
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,921
and you can convert those
charts into dashboards.

174
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:59,141
Where we're going though
is rather than thinking

175
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,133
about individual AI features,

176
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,580
we are thinking about, like I said,

177
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,620
this Intelligent Work Management platform

178
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,960
and that works across
the entire lifecycle.

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,730
It's a foundational piece

180
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,370
across every part of the
app that you're using.

181
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,486
So, whether it's from setting a strategy

182
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:16,830
all the way through to
execution and delivery,

183
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,600
you're using AI processing

184
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,430
to improve planning and prioritization.

185
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,317
You're intelligent optimizing plans.

186
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,857
You're continuously monitoring execution,

187
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:28,023
and then reporting out on that delivery.

188
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,470
So, what does that look like?

189
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,390
Here's a few examples.
I'll walk through it.

190
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,680
And you'll see kind of along the bottom

191
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
kind of how we're going
through that journey.

192
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,100
That end-to-end life cycle, right?

193
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,460
You start with just being able to define

194
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,752
what is it we're gonna do?

195
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:46,218
I was talking to a customer
where they talked about

196
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:49,440
how they were spending weeks
or even months sometimes

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,511
just developing a plan
before they even know

198
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,630
that they have the capacity
to take on that plan, right?

199
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,620
Where they have to figure out like,

200
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,120
what are all the work items we have to do,

201
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,783
what's the resource capacity to do that?

202
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,480
And that's a ton of time.

203
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,500
And then that goes into planning,

204
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,820
and then it might not even get approved,

205
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,603
or it may not meet the bar for
work that gets actually done.

206
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,350
We see an opportunity to
leverage guided prompting,

207
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,200
templates, and document
extraction and processing,

208
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,241
so you can take, you can say,

209
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:17,021
"Here's a project brief
I got from a client,"

210
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:19,501
or "Here's a statement of
work that I am working on

211
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,337
and here's some instructions.

212
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,507
And also, can you pull in best guidelines

213
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:27,245
for this type of project
and use this template

214
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:30,870
that we have designed as the
way that we work in Smartsheet.

215
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,310
Take all those things and build out

216
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,840
a fully functional project plan,

217
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,533
dependencies, timelines,
everything in minutes.

218
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,713
And that, as opposed to doing
all of that legwork manually

219
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,363
over several weeks.

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
I forgot to mention that that capability,

221
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,870
there's an early version of
that capability already live

222
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,860
in our trial experience.

223
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,630
So if you go sign up
for a Smartsheet trial,

224
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,430
you'll get a pre, not the document piece,

225
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,740
but the other parts.

226
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,862
And we're bringing the
document part of that

227
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:59,463
to all our customers in the near future.

228
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,350
So, the other piece we
talked about is like,

229
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,460
once you get all those projects in,

230
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,140
you have these proposals,
you're trying to triage that.

231
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,121
Like, how do you prioritize that?

232
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,830
Again, that's a lot of manual processing,

233
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,534
but sometimes there's
ways to look at like,

234
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,910
can we just do an analysis of like,

235
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,005
the budgets and the costs and the,

236
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,738
is it aligned to an OKR

237
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,420
or a program that we need to deliver on?

238
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,605
And we are bringing AI-powered columns

239
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,380
that are processing data

240
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,540
directly in your sheet using an LLM.

241
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,600
And that allows you to do
kind of nuanced analysis.

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,830
So you can do a sentiment analysis,

243
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,260
summarization, extraction, et cetera.

244
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,860
Imagine performing any kind
of LLM prompt-based capability

245
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,960
and automatically
running that on every row

246
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,423
in your portfolio intake.

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,930
The really exciting thing

248
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,816
is once you have all of
these prioritized items,

249
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:49,177
you can start to think about like,

250
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,127
"Okay, what does the
future of that look like?

251
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,880
What does that roadmap look like?

252
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,610
Do we have the capacity
to take on that work?"

253
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,650
Right now, we have in beta a capability

254
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,010
we call Scenario Planning and
it is a Portfolio Level view,

255
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,050
It is a view of all your resources,

256
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,060
all your projects side by side.

257
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,340
And you can see in real
time how shifting work out

258
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,600
is going to impact the capacity you have.

259
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,570
And we're gonna layer
onto that AI capabilities

260
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,630
that will then kind of build
up different scenarios.

261
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,675
So, it could be if I optimize
for balancing my capacity

262
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,510
versus optimizing for cost

263
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,970
versus optimizing for timely delivery,

264
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,790
I can map out different
scenarios and compare those

265
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,980
and have a really data-informed decision

266
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,204
about what we're gonna work on

267
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,643
across our roadmap and portfolio.

268
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,270
So, once you have that work going,

269
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,220
you've decided you've
prioritized the work,

270
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,482
you've got a bunch of projects in flight.

271
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:49,756
How do you know things
are going well, right?

272
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:51,745
Like that slide I put at the beginning

273
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:53,100
of the word cloud, right?

274
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,650
All those, all that work to
kind of just track things

275
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,720
and get things up-to-date,
get people to update things,

276
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,110
and connect to things and
understand the state of things.

277
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,090
We are bringing what we call
a Smart Assist experience.

278
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,007
And this is an AI Copilot experience

279
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:09,120
that is tuned for Project
Portfolio Management

280
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,850
and it allows you to
do things like analyze

281
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,623
for risk within your project,

282
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:16,110
get summaries of recent activity,

283
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,225
create executive summaries of progress.

284
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:20,144
Like a progress report
that you can share out

285
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:24,180
with your executives and be
able to do all those things

286
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,330
just in a few seconds and
across multiple projects.

287
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,370
So, here we're seeing it in
the context of a project.

288
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,670
We also plan to bring this
to a Portfolio Level view.

289
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,740
So you can imagine instead
of a singular project,

290
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,390
I'm asking if these types of questions

291
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,513
across my entire portfolio
or a subset of my portfolio.

292
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,970
The other part, like I said

293
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,040
is keeping track of those updates, right?

294
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,420
So, Smartsheet actually has a lot

295
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,680
of really powerful capabilities

296
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
to remind people to update things,

297
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,520
to pull in updates from different tools.

298
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,240
And this Copilot can automate
a lot of that process.

299
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,700
So for example, here
we're seeing, you know,

300
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,701
build me a daily scrum or sorry,

301
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,230
a daily standup where it's gonna,

302
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,480
it's basically aggregating
people's updates

303
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,270
directly from whether it's Slack or Teams.

304
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,520
It's summarizing those,
highlighting risks,

305
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,040
pulling those out, sending
you a summary update.

306
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,270
And you're able to, you know,

307
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,660
not have to go do that
drudgery work, right?

308
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,620
Of collecting all the information.

309
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,403
It's doing that for you
automatically in the background.

310
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,600
And when we think about
combining those things, right?

311
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,814
Automated actions plus the
kind of risk project expertise

312
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,317
and risk analysis and all that,

313
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,522
we are bringing those
together into agents.

314
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,060
And agents then can perform
a lot of that work for you

315
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,410
in the background automatically.

316
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,410
So, rather than you going
to log in to Smartsheet

317
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,690
and saying, "Hey, what's
the risk in this project,

318
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,620
this portfolio?

319
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,320
It is continually monitoring
that in the background,

320
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,314
looking for changes to the risk profile

321
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:53,370
of different projects,

322
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,909
doing heuristic-based analysis of like,

323
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,427
how urgent is that risk?

324
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:00,600
Is it really a high risk or low risk?

325
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,910
And then sending you
alerts and warnings here.

326
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,490
So, this little demonstration is showing,

327
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,673
like a project manager getting
alert in Microsoft Teams.

328
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,030
That there's a resourcing
risk within their project.

329
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,863
And so, they don't even have

330
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:14,040
to be logging in and monitoring.

331
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,270
It's monitoring it for them.

332
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,642
It brings them in,
shows them some options,

333
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,900
gives them opportunity to reassign work,

334
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,820
address that risk, take action,

335
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,570
and it can actually perform
the action on their behalf.

336
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,841
And this is my favorite part here,

337
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:31,170
where at the end of that it's
also maintaining a raid log.

338
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,813
How many people know what a raid log is?

339
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,603
A couple people.

340
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:38,133
Okay, so it's like risks,
actions, decisions.

341
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,170
This is a great way,

342
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,171
it's a good project management practice

343
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,510
but it takes a lot of diligence,

344
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,030
and to remember to do that every time.

345
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,430
Like, oh, this changed
or we're gonna log that.

346
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,740
So, the agent can track project changes

347
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,050
like when dates shifted,
when risks got occurred,

348
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,280
actions were taken,

349
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,230
and it's maintaining
this raid log for you.

350
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,360
And that is gonna help inform

351
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,660
continuous learning and
improvement over time.

352
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,700
And so, when we think

353
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,513
about how that portfolio
lifecycle comes to a close,

354
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,200
if we've successfully
delivered on the project,

355
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,981
you know, projects never
run perfectly, right?

356
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:16,932
So, you have those learnings,
you have those raid logs,

357
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:18,780
you have the data that's been collecting.

358
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,920
Again that's feeding back into the data

359
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:24,330
and into that foundation
of what's happening with,

360
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,860
across your portfolio.

361
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,576
We can start to run analysis
on patterns and trends

362
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,110
that are happening across your work.

363
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,017
So, we can use, like, for
this example is saying,

364
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:37,230
"Hey, we've noticed this common pattern

365
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,269
within your portfolio
where you have this issue

366
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,150
and we are recommending
based on best practices

367
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,570
and other customers who
in similar domain as you,

368
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,760
that they have implemented this practice

369
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,313
within their project management solution.

370
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,783
And through, because we have
the ability to deploy changes

371
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:57,310
to your solution design
for your portfolio,

372
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,940
you can immediately
deploy those changes out

373
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,520
even to projects in flight
and make those changes.

374
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,327
So, you're continuously improving
the work that's going on."

375
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,811
All right, so bringing
it all back together.

376
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,663
We'd look at the project
life cycle, right?

377
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,900
From setting the strategy
through execution,

378
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,670
all the way to delivery

379
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,560
and looking at that across the portfolio.

380
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,230
This kind of a little bit
of a mess of a diagram here

381
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,060
is showing how we walked
through those stages

382
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,200
and you could see how agents and AI

383
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,677
are powering each stage of that process,

384
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,100
but at the end of it,

385
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,080
you're getting these postmortem learnings.

386
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,535
So, yes, you're getting value on day one,

387
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,210
but the idea is that
all of those learnings

388
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,063
are feeding back into that
data into virtuous cycle.

389
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,850
So, every time you go through this loop,

390
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,120
you are increasing the knowledge

391
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,679
that the knowledge graph has.

392
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,589
And that that is improving
and increasing the level

393
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:59,490
of sophistication and insights
and tailored to your business

394
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,020
so that you are continually improving

395
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,730
and increasing the efficiency

396
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,875
and throughput of your portfolio work.

397
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,125
(attendees chattering)

398
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,953
All right.

399
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,780
Well, I can't really talk
about this unless I mention AWS

400
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,543
'cause we're here at the
AWS conference, of course.

401
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,200
So, how is all this working?

402
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,360
So a lot of this that, that I showed you,

403
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,279
some of it we have that Smart
Assist Copilot experience

404
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,300
is in private beta for
some of our customers today

405
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,267
and is coming out to our
Early Adopter Program later.

406
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,850
Those other capabilities
are in development

407
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,993
and all of that is built
on AWS as a foundation.

408
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,969
So, we think about these,

409
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:42,238
I've kind of grouped this more
into like conceptual layers

410
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:46,260
to think about at that
foundation is that data, right?

411
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,360
We have that knowledge graph.

412
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,110
The knowledge graph is being
powered by Amazon Neptune.

413
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,760
We have, we are building
conversation history

414
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,200
and long-term memory.

415
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,293
And that is using a Postgres SQL database.

416
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,410
We have, we're building out a data lake,

417
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,780
so we are aggregating and
collecting all of that data

418
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,710
and bringing that together.

419
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,660
And that forms that data foundation again,

420
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,510
that you're recycling through, right?

421
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,080
On top of that, we have agent tools.

422
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,100
So, these are the actions

423
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,110
that the agents can perform, right?

424
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,754
And these are both
tools that are available

425
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:20,359
inside the product so that the agent

426
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,163
is running those tools

427
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,300
within the project that you're managing.

428
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,825
But we are also gonna be exposing those

429
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,841
through an MCP server that
allows you to access them

430
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,713
through external AI services.

431
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:36,447
And those agent tools, we
actually started this process

432
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,913
before AgentCore was a thing,

433
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,505
or at least before it was available.

434
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:42,960
So, we've built a lot of this,

435
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,750
some of this are kinda
from scratch, right?

436
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,450
And right now we're going
through that evaluation of like,

437
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,700
oh, maybe there's a way
that we can leverage

438
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,035
a lot of the capabilities that
just got announced here today

439
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:56,160
or this week.

440
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,753
So, we're currently evaluating AgentCore

441
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,610
as part of that experience,

442
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,613
specifically AgentCore
runtime for these tools.

443
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,790
Then you have the Agent
Orchestration Layer.

444
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,833
So, this is where we
have different sub-agent

445
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,450
that are specialized, right?

446
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,280
You have a sub-agent who is tuned

447
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
to understand resource management.

448
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
There's another sub-agent who is tuned

449
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,163
to look at risk profiles
and evaluating risk.

450
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,480
And those sub-agents then are,
we're using Amazon Bedrock

451
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,130
and the Claude models
built into Amazon Bedrock,

452
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,801
and using the Strands SDK
to then build and define

453
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:31,023
how those agents are operating.

454
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,500
And those agents then deploy those tools

455
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,496
as needed to take action.

456
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:38,100
So, we talk about this
as insight to action.

457
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,965
So, the agent is monitoring,
looking for risk,

458
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:45,005
looking for challenges,
identifying like stale data

459
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,530
or missing data, and then
deploying these tools

460
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,750
to take the appropriate
action to fill in the data,

461
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,720
get updates, flag risk,
change resourcing adjustments,

462
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,023
et cetera, to take action on that.

463
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,200
And then, on top of all of that

464
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,410
is a responsible AI layer, right?

465
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,000
So, this is governance across all of this.

466
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,610
Like, you can't just
have the AI running wild.

467
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,630
You need to be able to observe

468
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,280
exactly everything it's doing.

469
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,609
So, we have guardrails, which is managing

470
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,530
like moderation of inputs and outputs.

471
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,710
You have OpenSearch to
track logs and auditing.

472
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,792
So, there's full
traceability and auditability

473
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,992
of all the actions that
are being performed.

474
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,420
And we have an administrative
layer experience.

475
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,010
So, our Smartsheet admin experience

476
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,403
has data access controls,
user access controls

477
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:34,320
and feature enablement/disablement,

478
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,710
and overall auditing across
all the actions across,

479
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,870
not just, you could actually
have multiple portfolios

480
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,945
operating within Smartsheet
and you can observe that

481
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,833
at the administrative layer.

482
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,690
And so, what does it
mean that we have tools?

483
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,570
Talk a little bit about that for a second.

484
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,728
We are building all of these out today.

485
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:56,179
We have, you'll see
kind of a gradient here.

486
00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:00,459
The tools that are full opacity
as it were on this slide

487
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,547
are available as part of
our Smartsheet experience,

488
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,740
and we're continuing to add to those.

489
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,360
So these are, again,
are gonna be available

490
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,350
inside the product.

491
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,630
They enable a lot of
capabilities inside the product,

492
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,330
not just existing features but new ones.

493
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,770
And we're gonna be enabling those

494
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,990
through an external MCP server

495
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,972
so that you could take advantage of,

496
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:21,187
you know, for example, being able to call

497
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,390
a Smartsheet agent
externally through the MCP

498
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,090
to perform actions on your behalf.

499
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,224
And when we think about responsible
AI on that layer on top,

500
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:37,020
really there's kind of four
principles that we see.

501
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,556
Data privacy and security.

502
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:41,250
So, that's that control accountability.

503
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,360
So, that's being able to like,

504
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,500
see everything that it's doing,

505
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,360
that you can govern every
action's being performed,

506
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,420
transparency, explainability,
understanding each action,

507
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,160
why it's recommending actions,

508
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,801
and why it perform that action.

509
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:52,980
And then making sure

510
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,182
that it is providing fair
and reasonable responses

511
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:57,982
to everything that you're inputting.

512
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,523
So, let's wrap it up.

513
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:02,280
It looks like I'm out of time anyway.

514
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,870
So, the future of portfolio management

515
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,220
looks like this, right?

516
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,400
From hours spent building
out project plans to minutes,

517
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,544
turning a doc straight
into a working project.

518
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:15,630
From stuck processes to
intelligent end-to-end flows.

519
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,760
From manually tracking down,

520
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,650
you know, hounding down
a particular person,

521
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,380
you have agents automatically
updating, tracking,

522
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,709
and responding to stale data
or updates that are required.

523
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,700
And instead of just the status quo,

524
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,983
you're getting this continuous, virtuous,

525
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:34,230
continuous learning and virtuous cycle
