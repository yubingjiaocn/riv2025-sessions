1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,360
- [Peter] Hi everybody.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,110
Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,350
We know that investing in travel

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,200
and investing in being
here is no small thing.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,513
So welcome to Las Vegas.
Welcome to re:Invent.

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,350
We know that customers
have this expectation

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,910
around where their data is,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,710
and ISVs have this insane
covenant that you are holding

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,670
and handling customer data
on behalf of that customer.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,290
And if you're doing it on AWS,

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,630
there are some very definite ways

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,150
to not only secure customer data,

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,400
but to provide the necessary assurances

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,410
and transparency so that customers

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,450
can form independent opinions

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,973
that you're doing the
right thing in over time.

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,460
My name is Peter O'Donnell.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,900
I'm a principal solutions architect.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,490
I've been with Amazon Web Services

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,320
for just about 10 and a half years.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,030
This is my 12th re:Invent

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,210
and I'm joined today by Jenn
Reed, another principal SA

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,530
who covers one of our largest

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,813
and most strategically critical ISVs.

25
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,970
So we're gonna talk a little bit

26
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,450
about what this means to protect data

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,907
and where cryptography
plays a role in that

28
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:11,970
and the history of what
it means to manage keys.

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,970
We have come a long way from
very expensive, hard to manage,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,480
cumbersome, single tenant, gigantic HSMs

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,400
that live in your own building

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,370
to a much more flexible
cloud-like capability.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,550
With AWS KMS, our key management service,

34
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,550
which does still indeed have
very expensive HSMs behind it.

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,280
We talk about why customers care

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,733
about bringing their own
key and what BYOK means.

37
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,460
'Cause as it turns out, we've overloaded

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,113
that term in our history.

39
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,710
We talk about two different
ways of approaching

40
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,870
what it means to protected
secure customer data

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,250
with customer keys.

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,930
And then finally, Jenn's
gonna show you some

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,450
really neat software, some
code that we've developed

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,220
to give you an example and a taste

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,420
for what it takes to
implement these things.

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,210
So I mentioned that we've
overloaded the term BYOK.

47
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,980
In the beginning we had a very large

48
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,870
and important financial services customer

49
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,180
who demanded that we create something

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,353
that was a "big red
button" in their words.

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,120
And this became a feature
known as import key material.

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,130
If you're familiar with
KMS, there's this idea

53
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,030
of a customer managed key, a CMK.

54
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,720
And you think about it as
a key and it has a key ID

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,660
and it even has an ARN,
an Amazon resource name.

56
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,483
But the CMK is not the actual key.

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,990
The key is a notional construct.

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,573
And there is in fact
key material within it.

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,630
The original BYOK feature allowed you

60
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,807
to import your own key
material into that thing.

61
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:51,510
And that was actually
not the interesting part.

62
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,360
The interesting part is
that we allow you to burn

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,270
that key material instantaneously

64
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,783
while keeping the construct of the CMK.

65
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,420
That allows a customer to
hit that big red button,

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,430
remove the key material
from inside of that CMK,

67
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,430
but later reimport it and
undo that big red button.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,580
What we're primarily talking
about today when we say BYOK

69
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,540
is allowing customers to
have their own key material

70
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,750
and their own key to protect their data.

71
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,270
And that is the high order tenet.

72
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,600
The high order tenet is that customer data

73
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,260
ought to be protected by customer keys.

74
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,050
This is the expectation
that the engineers have.

75
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,570
This is the expectation
that the executives have.

76
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,180
This is the expectation that regulators

77
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,580
and other third party
stakeholders may have.

78
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,160
It's a very simple, straightforward idea.

79
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,590
If it's customer data,
it should be protected

80
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,000
with customer keys.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,790
And indeed we take that
tenet very seriously

82
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,360
in our own services when
we store and process data

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
on your behalf across
dozens and dozens and dozens

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,870
of such services, from
databases to file systems,

85
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,300
to the object store and everything else,

86
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,030
we allow our customers to protect
their data with their keys

87
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,180
in some as ISVs, same covenant,
same set of expectations

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,713
for largely the same reasons.

89
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,460
So Slack was one of the first big ISVs

90
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,140
that really got this right.

91
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,570
And you could imagine
if you've used Slack,

92
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,980
and we certainly do,

93
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,290
there's a lot of
confidential stuff in Slack,

94
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,520
whether it's messages,

95
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,760
the contact data itself, exchanging files.

96
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,680
And of course Slack these days can do lots

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,290
of other really interesting
collaboration things.

98
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,370
But this idea of what it
means to have your own key

99
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,583
is often perceived differently
by different customers.

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,460
We generally take it to mean
that it's a customer CMK,

101
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,490
in a customer account that is shared

102
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,970
cross account to the ISV to make use of,

103
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,583
and that's what we're gonna talk about.

104
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,740
So when customers think
about this problem, right,

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,290
I think it's important as
ISVs that you understand

106
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,700
where they are coming from

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,043
and why they are asking this of you.

108
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:12,540
"I need to have my keys protect my data."

109
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,940
And I mentioned this idea
of the big red button.

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,220
That because of this strange
role where you are handling

111
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,320
and processing customer
data on their behalf,

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,860
that's core to your business,
it's a covenant of trust.

113
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,950
But customers still
will very often believe

114
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,900
that they need a big red button

115
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,740
so that if you have an event

116
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,580
or they spill something
into your software,

117
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,400
which depending on what
you're using, if it's logging,

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,140
everybody who's in the logging business

119
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,880
should know about log spills.

120
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
The customer will want a mechanism,

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,900
a mechanism to immediately
disable access to that data.

122
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,120
And that's the big red button.

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,340
But there's also dimensions of assurance

124
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,990
that are required here.

125
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,790
Customers want to observe

126
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,640
how you are using the
key material over time

127
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,850
and how you are implementing the covenant

128
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,560
of what you agreed to on paper

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,810
or what you agreed to in a meeting.

130
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,630
And that's also part of what it means

131
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,003
to let them use their own key.

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,960
On AWS, we log almost all
of our APIs into CloudTrail.

133
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,460
And I say almost all

134
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,470
because there are data plane events in S3,

135
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,080
that's actually something
you have to go turn on.

136
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,920
But KMS logs everything, all encrypt,

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,380
decrypt generate data key, describe key,

138
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,053
there's a bunch of other
APIs, are in CloudTrail.

139
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
What's interesting about KMS

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,590
is that if you use it cross account

141
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,580
that a calling principle
in one account using S3

142
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,950
but references a key in another account,

143
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,510
we output two events, identical events,

144
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,790
but into two separate trails.

145
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,160
The trail of the calling principle,

146
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,203
which might be your ISV service account,

147
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,250
and the trail that belongs to the account

148
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,833
that holds the resource,
that is to say the key.

149
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,040
And customers really like this.

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,620
So you'll still have your own CloudTrail

151
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,590
where you can see your
use of the customer's key,

152
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,350
but because the key
belongs to the customer

153
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,880
in the other account, they
will get corresponding

154
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,470
CloudTrail records as well.

155
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,820
And this is very important.

156
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,180
I mentioned, you know, this
idea of the big red button,

157
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,910
but disabling and revoking
access, customers want to be able

158
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,610
to also control the lifecycle of that key,

159
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,673
maybe give you a new key
after a period of time.

160
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,550
By thinking of this way

161
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,420
and building the support into
your products from the outset,

162
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,830
you can support that.

163
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,810
Oh, we're gonna start
using a different key.

164
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,810
Sure, go into those settings control panel

165
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,060
and change the ARN of the key

166
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,560
and of course make sure
you properly authorize it.

167
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,230
And there's also a
compliance dimension to this.

168
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,010
Whether it's compliance
with an external entity

169
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,900
like a regulator or anything else,

170
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
or even just internal controls compliance,

171
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,438
that being able to protect
the data is not enough,

172
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,630
you also must be able to tell that story

173
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,643
and provide assurances over time.

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,560
In the international market,
the idea of data sovereignty

175
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,780
becomes even more important,

176
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,220
especially in Europe now

177
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,730
and increasingly in
jurisdictions all over the world.

178
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,390
There is again this heightened
emphasis on the core tenet

179
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,700
that my data should be
protected with my keys

180
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,263
and that can help lead to
data sovereignty outcomes.

181
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,270
And third party
stakeholders also love this.

182
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,570
The beginning of my career I
worked for a very large bank

183
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,310
through AWS, I worked for AWS,

184
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,560
but they were by big baby, my customer.

185
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,900
And they made a clear decision early on

186
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,390
that all data in the
cloud would be encrypted.

187
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,180
Today that's a very normal thing to say.

188
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,240
10 years ago it was actually
pretty revolutionary

189
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
that they were gonna A,

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,270
move a bank system of
record to the cloud at all

191
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,990
and B, demand that ubiquitous encryption.

192
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,003
But today this is table stakes.

193
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,710
And if your product doesn't
support these capabilities,

194
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,450
there will be customers who will see that

195
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,440
as a gating decision, a
purchasing gating decision

196
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,540
that if they can't have
their data protected

197
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,083
by their keys, they might not buy.

198
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,110
So the motivation for
you is, as I just said,

199
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,583
that this is table stakes.

200
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,040
Having been here since 2015,

201
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
I can tell you when this
wonderful customer of mine,

202
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,780
of ours, first said this,

203
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,820
ubiquitous encryption was a big idea.

204
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,970
We didn't really have ubiquitous
encryption at the time,

205
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,140
in 2015.

206
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,043
Today we do.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,790
But that also means that
your products must as well.

208
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,130
And even if you support encryption,

209
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,620
you need to be able to tell a rich story

210
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,200
that if it's just an encrypted file system

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,630
and there is no separate authorization

212
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,490
once the file system is mounted,

213
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,490
that that may not solve your
customer's requirements either.

214
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
Now the good news is customers
tend to trust AWS KMS.

215
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,260
I can tell you firsthand,
a lot of the first part

216
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,177
of my career here was
explaining to customers

217
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:18,960
how KMS worked, explaining
to them the HSMs,

218
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,600
the design of the HSMs,
our regulatory position

219
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,943
as it regards FIPS or anything else.

220
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,320
And now customers generally support KMS.

221
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,850
They like its characteristics,

222
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,470
they like that it comes from us,

223
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,420
they like that it's FIPS validated now

224
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,240
with the 140-3, which is the new program

225
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,990
that succeeded dash two and level three.

226
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,660
And if you're not a FIPS
nerd, it doesn't matter.

227
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,560
Just know that those are the
table stakes, but we have it.

228
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,990
But achieving this kind
of compliance coverage

229
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,940
is really critical for customers,

230
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,180
especially as they tell their own story.

231
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,743
Their data that they are
holding is protected by KMS.

232
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,330
Why wouldn't their data
that you are holding

233
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,823
also meet that same bar?

234
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,480
Now what's cool is that
KMS is really flexible

235
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,460
and it's lovely and it integrates

236
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,780
with all of our managed services

237
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,750
and you can integrate it
with your own software.

238
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,190
In the second part of the presentation

239
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,410
Jenn will kind of show you what that means

240
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,470
because we have built
some really nice SDKs

241
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,033
to make this easier for you.

242
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,970
An SDK for database services

243
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,520
that even allows a little bit of searching

244
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,980
over encrypted data in Dynamo,

245
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,160
and an SDK for just general encryption.

246
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,050
So general client side encryption,

247
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,180
whether it's a blob or anything else.

248
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,640
We've got some SDKs
that integrate with KMS,

249
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,130
but they certainly don't lock you into it.

250
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,240
One thing that Jenn will show you

251
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,360
is that you have alternatives
for the key provider.

252
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,310
Again, it works out of the box with KMS,

253
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,900
but if you wanna hook
it up to something else,

254
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,803
you certainly can.

255
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,080
And so KMS solves a lot
of problems for you.

256
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,420
The soul of what we do here at AWS

257
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,300
is what we call
undifferentiated heavy lifting.

258
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,570
And so we've already figured
out how to scale KMS,

259
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,743
how to keep it healthy.

260
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,580
It is our highest level of SLA.

261
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,450
We deliver KMS at a SLA of five nines.

262
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,220
And in fact the reality is significantly

263
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,470
more available than that.

264
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,760
There's already transparent
rotation built into KMS

265
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,870
where we will increment
the underlying key material

266
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,320
and just a lot of genuine
value that comes from the fact

267
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,003
that you're integrating with KMS.

268
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,410
So there are a couple of
different kinds of KMS

269
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,540
that all has a top layer, the KMS APIs.

270
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,010
Then there's a second layer,

271
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,963
which is where the keys actually live.

272
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,230
The best solution for
effectively all customers

273
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,060
is regular KMS where the key
material is both generated

274
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,810
within and used for
cryptographic operations

275
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,870
within KMS multi-tenant HSMs.

276
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,360
And again, these things are the real deal.

277
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,630
They are bespoke, they're
built to our design

278
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,490
and they are FIPS validated.

279
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,330
And point in fact, the
entire box is FIPS validated.

280
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,470
It's not just a little widget

281
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,510
inside of a plain vanilla server.

282
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,783
The entire widget is a
validated FIPS module.

283
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,020
But there are some alternatives

284
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,780
that will be relevant for your customers.

285
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,460
I mentioned earlier that
the original definition

286
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,310
of BYOK allowed for imported key material.

287
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,060
We call this an imported
CMK, where the CMK,

288
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,090
the construct, exists at the KMS API,

289
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,943
but the key material is
injected by the customer.

290
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,617
Some customers came to us and said,

291
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:49,260
"Well I can't quite convince everybody

292
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,020
that a multi-tenant HSM is a good idea.

293
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,570
I think it is and I'm
an expert in this stuff.

294
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,500
But sometimes people are like,

295
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,350
what do you mean a multi-tenant HSM?"

296
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,120
And so we offered an alternative.

297
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,960
We have a cloud HSM product

298
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,180
that is in fact a single tenant HSM

299
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,470
and you can graft that thing
onto the top layer of KMS

300
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,877
and that's called custom key store.

301
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,340
And it does exactly what it says.

302
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,630
If you've got a stakeholder

303
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,370
or a customer stakeholder

304
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,240
who absolutely can't
accept using a regular KMS,

305
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,183
you can hook cloud HSM up
to it and get that outcome.

306
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,120
We built another thing

307
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,620
that we're sure we don't
think anybody should use,

308
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,230
but we built it because
customers demanded it of us,

309
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,260
which is practically the
reason we build anything.

310
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,603
And that's called XKS,
the external key store.

311
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,800
This allows for sometimes
what you will hear

312
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,603
referred to as HYOK, hold your own key.

313
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,780
The cool part about
the cloud is that we do

314
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,780
all of the impossible part,
from the ground to the concrete,

315
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,783
to locking the doors at night,
all the way up to the stack.

316
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,150
Some customers, whether
because the requirement

317
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,960
is placed upon them by a third party

318
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,790
or because there's somebody
in the security org

319
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,943
that needs a warm blanket,
which is an okay reason,

320
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,390
believe that that key
needs to live in a building

321
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,860
that they control.

322
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,930
It needs to be in my house.

323
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,113
Like all right, we'll
build it and we built it.

324
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,780
This allows you to have an HSM

325
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,640
that lives in your own office building

326
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,250
but is hooked up to the front end of KMS

327
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,453
and that's called XKS.

328
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,990
Probably don't let people do this.

329
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,700
It comes with scaling,

330
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,830
it comes with availability characteristics

331
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,930
that are gonna be radically different

332
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,170
than good old regular KMS
where we do the scaling

333
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,550
and the availability for you.

334
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,720
But it is out there.

335
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,460
But the good news is as you
build to integrate it with KMS,

336
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,490
your customers still get
all this flexibility.

337
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,020
That you yourself as the ISV,

338
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,720
don't really need a
reason about this part,

339
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,970
but it will be relevant
for the conversation.

340
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,083
So let's do a quick primer.

341
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,010
I think a lot of people think
they know what encryption is,

342
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,103
but as it turns out, encrypting
data is the easy part.

343
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,280
All you gotta do is combine
a data key with data

344
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,200
and then you get ciphered
data, encrypted data.

345
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,093
That is categorically the easy part.

346
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,150
That's what you're probably already doing.

347
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,700
But the problem is what do
I do with this data key?

348
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,023
Where do I put it? How do
I keep it safe over time?

349
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:35,370
And the answer is that
you combine that data key

350
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,860
with another key and you encrypt

351
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,200
the key with a different key.

352
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,440
This is known as wrapping.
Wrapping like a present.

353
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,470
So you're gonna wrap that
data key with the KMS key

354
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,663
and now you have an encrypted data key.

355
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,840
So where do you store that?

356
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,049
Well, as it turns out, the right place

357
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,073
to store it is just store
it with the encrypted data.

358
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,860
You store the data encryption key,

359
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,140
I'm gonna start calling that a DEK.

360
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,120
You store the DEK wrapped with the top key

361
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,450
that lives in KMS and
you put it in one package

362
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,600
and then you put it
somewhere safe like S3.

363
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,090
The question is, "Well you told me Pete

364
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,870
start with the DEK.

365
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,280
You got a data encryption key,

366
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,290
then you gotta protect
that with another key.

367
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,600
Great. Is it turtles all the way down.

368
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,280
What do I do with the KMS key?"

369
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,530
And that's where we come
in. We do the rest of it.

370
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,490
And if you wanna learn about

371
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,000
all the full key hierarchy of
KMS, you can find that online.

372
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,010
It's actually a pretty interesting story.

373
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,990
We take care of all that other hard part.

374
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,790
And of course we protect
your KMS keys at rest

375
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,930
by encrypting them again.

376
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,070
And then there's a whole thing

377
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,380
and it kind of is
turtles all the way down,

378
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,070
but it ends in, you
know, printed out paper

379
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,930
that if we ever lost curb power,

380
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,230
we could turn the stack of
turtles back on the hard way.

381
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,300
We've never had that, knock wood,

382
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,343
but we do have a plan for that.

383
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,400
And so that's what the
perimeter for encryption is.

384
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,030
We call this pattern of unique DEKs

385
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,020
that protect data with DEKs
that are then protected

386
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,680
by a high order key, envelope encryption.

387
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,520
And this is the way
all of it works at AWS,

388
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,190
and this is the way you
should probably do it as well.

389
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,620
And Jenn's gonna talk about
this idea of a key ring,

390
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,410
about starting your own key hierarchy

391
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,483
with a key that you get out of KMS.

392
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,700
So that all sounds great.

393
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,460
Now we know why customers care.

394
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,500
We know what they're looking for

395
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,730
and we kind of understand, okay,

396
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,240
envelope encryption, how do you do it?

397
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,770
How should a customer let
you use their key material

398
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,010
to integrate with your
software to protect their data

399
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,723
that is in your hands?

400
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,080
There's a couple simple ways to do this.

401
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,810
If you're just writing objects into S3,

402
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,510
just do cross account key sharing.

403
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,123
End of list.

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,140
But if you're holding
a multi-tenant database

405
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,260
with individual customer records,

406
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,960
it's a lot more complicated
than just give me the ARN.

407
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,860
And depending on the nature of your ISV,

408
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,470
if you've got your own data plane

409
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,870
and it's not just a relational database

410
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,750
but perhaps a much more complex data plane

411
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,470
that is itself probably multi-tenant.

412
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,130
Now you've got some very
interesting complexities,

413
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,901
complexities around availability,

414
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:36,900
complexities around persistence.

415
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
'Cause the only thing
worse than losing data

416
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,680
is losing a key 'cause losing a key

417
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,953
is like losing data, except even harder.

418
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,290
So how do customers share
their keys with you?

419
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,060
So there's three ways to do this.

420
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,110
If what you're doing is
primarily just interacting

421
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,010
with AWS resources, that is
to say you're not in the weeds

422
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,470
of your own data plane and
a multi-tenant data plane.

423
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,440
Just do it cross account resource sharing.

424
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,050
It's one of the oldest
tricks from the IAM book.

425
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,660
You write a resource policy
that goes on the key,

426
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,523
we call that a key policy.

427
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,280
And you delegate effectively,
a service principle

428
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,310
that belongs to you, the ISV.

429
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,930
So service.acmecorp.com

430
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,980
is allowed to call for encrypt, decrypt,

431
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,813
generate data key and describe key.

432
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,870
That's the simplest part.

433
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,370
Some customers think well

434
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,560
or some ISVs think "Well
no, what I really want,

435
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,420
what I really wanna do is
assume one of their roles

436
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,490
and then use that to access the key."

437
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,280
No, why would you do that? Don't do that.

438
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,230
Just do cross account resource sharing.

439
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,297
Now sometimes vendors are like,

440
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:55,120
"Oh well I'll call this BYOK

441
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,130
and I'll have all the key material

442
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,130
and there's a key for Alice
and there's a key for Bob."

443
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,983
But it's not really bring
your own key if you do that.

444
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,740
Customers don't get the logging visibility

445
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,573
that we talked about.

446
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:09,406
They certainly don't get

447
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,400
the big red button that we talked about.

448
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,350
And so your customer's level of trust

449
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,000
in the eventual solution that you're going

450
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,150
to market with can be greatly affected

451
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,983
by the choices that you make here.

452
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,770
We want you to be successful,
we really want our customers

453
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,350
to be successful and you
guys are our customers.

454
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,683
But often your customers are
also somehow our customers.

455
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,500
And so we want you to
do this the right way,

456
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,550
which is why we're here having this talk.

457
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,360
So as it turns out,
cross account key sharing

458
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,660
is really straightforward.

459
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,660
Resources on AWS have
their own policy document

460
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,130
called a resource policy.

461
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,570
And when you're talking about S3,

462
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,420
it's often referred to as a bucket policy.

463
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,120
If you're talking about KMS,
it's called a key policy.

464
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,383
And as it turns out, this
is really straightforward.

465
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Statement, allow principle
that belongs to Acme Corp.

466
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,660
Action, encrypt, decrypt,

467
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,643
generate data key and describe key.

468
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,200
Pretty straightforward stuff.

469
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,090
It's key to understand, haha pun,

470
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,250
it's essential to understand

471
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,940
that you're only going to get authorized

472
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,590
for the cryptographic operations.

473
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,810
That you do not need and
nor should you ask for

474
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,523
other actions on the key.

475
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,623
Those ought to belong to the
key owner, your customer.

476
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,890
'Cause some of those actions
could be really powerful.

477
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,560
Disable does exactly what it sounds like.

478
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,980
You don't need the ability to
call for disable on the key

479
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,513
and you should not ask for it.

480
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,390
There's a couple of other
very powerful actions.

481
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,890
Put key policy.

482
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,013
You do not need that and
nor should you ask for it.

483
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,860
And perhaps most powerful of all,

484
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,593
there's an API called
schedule key deletion.

485
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,830
We don't actually let
you delete it right away

486
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,020
'cause that's a very serious foot gun.

487
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,810
But schedule key deletion,
you do not need it

488
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,730
and you should not ask for it.

489
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,010
All you need is very simple.

490
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,290
Write on the key, encrypt, decrypt,

491
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,123
generate data key and describe key.

492
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,233
Now how do you get this going?

493
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,123
How do you kind of bootstrap
this new customer onboarding?

494
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,543
It's probably enough to
just publish some JSON.

495
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,000
This is what it needs to look like.

496
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,893
Copy and paste it on your key policy.

497
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,360
Your sales engineers can probably
do this for your customer

498
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,093
during onboarding or ramping or whatever.

499
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,650
You could probably give
them some cloud formation

500
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,600
which would create a key

501
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
and then put the right policy on it.

502
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,567
And lots of other ways
to think about this.

503
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,813
You wanna give 'em a terraform
thing? Sure, whatever.

504
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,260
But you should be reasoning about this

505
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,970
'cause it's essential that your customers

506
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,220
not only get it right so they can start

507
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,530
receiving the benefit of your software.

508
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,330
It would be dumb to delay time to value

509
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,400
just because it takes a week to figure out

510
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,900
what to put on the key policy.

511
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,320
And you want your
customers to get it right

512
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,330
for safety and security.

513
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,590
Because if they give you allow KMS star,

514
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,880
you now have too much ability

515
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,270
for all the things I just talked about.

516
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,270
Schedule key deletion,
disable, put key policy.

517
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,123
Don't let them give you
KMS star on the key policy.

518
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,330
Only take the actions you need.

519
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,370
Everybody knows the
phrase least privilege.

520
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,413
Make sure you get least privilege.

521
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,030
So there's a couple different
patterns, ultimately.

522
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,770
What I just described
is really simple stuff.

523
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,027
Like if I'm gonna put an object in S3

524
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:50,100
and I wanna protect it by your key,

525
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,193
all I have to say is put
object, dash, dash key ID.

526
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,160
But there are some more interesting

527
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,170
and complex ways to do this

528
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,983
in this idea of a data key broker.

529
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,560
Where you're gonna start
your own key hierarchy

530
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,150
from the customer's KMS key.

531
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,090
And then as you say, ingest log files

532
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,330
or create, you know, whatever kind of unit

533
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,853
of entity in your data plane.

534
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,360
You can take that envelope
encryption pattern

535
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,533
and add one more layer.

536
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,240
So it's KMS key to customer key,

537
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,390
customer key to data keys.

538
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,040
And you can add one more layer too,

539
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,855
depending on what makes
the most sense for you.

540
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:34,650
And this effectively,
again, is a key hierarchy.

541
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,480
And the data key broker pattern here

542
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,983
is a simple way to do that.

543
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,670
So as customers upload data,

544
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,980
there is certainly this
idea of crypto wear out.

545
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,660
You don't want to use a single DEK,

546
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,710
a single data encryption key
for a colossal body of data

547
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,630
that's got blast radius problems.

548
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,480
And at hyperscale there's a theoretical

549
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,340
crypto analytic problem with that.

550
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,170
Like if you go and
create petabytes of data

551
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,410
with a single DEK, it
creates an entry point

552
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,190
for an adversary to do
something like reverse the key.

553
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,930
It's very easy to avoid that

554
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,330
by not encrypting everything

555
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,030
with a single data encryption key.

556
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:14,861
And the workflow kind of looks like this.

557
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:16,740
I don't know how visible this is to you,

558
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,240
but you know these slides will eventually

559
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,100
get published on the internet.

560
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,490
But this is effectively
what the flow looks like

561
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,173
for this idea of the broker.

562
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,460
So there are some more
questions about this.

563
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,070
How do I request and
deal with the data keys?

564
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,140
How do I deal with multi-tenancy

565
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,360
and where does this kind of solve?

566
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,240
And again, this is where
our encryption SEKs come in,

567
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,760
they're open source, they're
available for a handful

568
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,240
of very popular languages,
Java, Python, things like that.

569
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,860
And it's awesome.

570
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,870
It does right what it says on the tin.

571
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,910
It's written by a group of experts

572
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,620
and it's open source so
you can understand it

573
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,520
and reason about it and maybe
even improve it on your own.

574
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,870
For client side encryption,
there are a bunch of questions,

575
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,700
how do I properly implement it?

576
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,140
What modes should I be using?

577
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,800
And again, the SDK is almost definitely

578
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,293
the right way to answer
all these questions.

579
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,350
The SDK has a message
format. It's pretty flexible.

580
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,300
You can even get multi-region resiliency

581
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,420
by either using multi-region keys,

582
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,300
which is a new thing we
introduced two, three years ago.

583
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,050
Or you just take the data

584
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,547
and the wrapped data key

585
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,830
and it's wrapped under
two different regions.

586
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,160
So if it's in Oregon, you
can unwrap the DEK in Oregon.

587
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,110
There's another version of the same DEK

588
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,710
that you can unwrap in Virginia.

589
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,460
There are two of these.

590
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,740
One is the general purpose ESDK.

591
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,110
This is suitable for blobs, right?

592
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,420
Whatever it is. A lump.

593
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,150
For database-specific applications,

594
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,470
particularly Dynamo,

595
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,660
which is probably the right
data store for most things.

596
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,960
But it certainly works with the
relational products as well.

597
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
The database-specific
SDK has some additional

598
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,790
considerations built into it.

599
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,330
And again, these are expert
level software packages.

600
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,610
They're both open source,
they're maintained

601
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,510
by a really brilliant group of people.

602
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,640
The ESDK is designed to
make it easy for portability

603
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,070
so that you can deal with these things.

604
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,160
There's again, a way to
register multiple key providers

605
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,660
so that if your customer expects you

606
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,790
to be available in both
Oregon and Virginia,

607
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,253
just as examples, that
there's a way to do that.

608
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,880
The single message format
makes it really easy

609
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,650
and high speed to deal with.

610
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,930
Mention this idea like where
do I store the wrapped key

611
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,820
and where do I store the encrypted data?

612
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,320
And I said the answer is put 'em together.

613
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,060
Well the ESDK does that.

614
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,890
It automatically puts them together.

615
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,630
And ultimately you kind of only need

616
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,490
to keep track of two things.

617
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,850
One that lump, the data,

618
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,400
and where the key is, the key provider,

619
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,920
which is not the DEK, 'cause
the DEK is with the lump,

620
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,090
the encrypted lump.

621
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,010
The key provider is, you know, which KMS?

622
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,040
The KMS in Virginia, KMS and Oregon.

623
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,110
'Cause of course like most things at AWS,

624
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,583
that will be region specific.

625
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,020
This is what that kind
of ends up looking like.

626
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,820
This is a little bit of an overview,

627
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,310
there's some details left out of this

628
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,170
for the simplicity of the diagram,

629
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,300
but this is basically
what that looks like.

630
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,223
That you call through to the ESDK.

631
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:24,450
The ESDK calls down to
the operating system

632
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,010
to get the right crypto.

633
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,100
Every operating system is
gonna know how to speak AESGCM,

634
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,863
which is an implementation of AES.

635
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,230
A mode.

636
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,665
And again, we get the blob that comes out,

637
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:38,010
that's in the lower right there,

638
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,210
where you get everything
necessary together.

639
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,500
I mentioned this idea of
a hierarchical key ring

640
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,170
and this is where I'm
gonna turn it over to Jenn.

641
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,440
There's a deep explanation of this

642
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,760
and practically everything I said

643
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,790
is examined very deeply
in our documentation.

644
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,800
So hopefully this is a pretty good primer.

645
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,030
This is a code talk

646
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,890
and I'm gonna turn it
over to my friend Jenn

647
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,480
who's gonna get into it.

648
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,313
Cheers.

649
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,623
Break a leg.

650
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,263
- [Jenn] I should not tape.

651
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,653
Okay.

652
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,693
Now for code.

653
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,893
Very good.

654
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,380
I hope everybody can see that pretty good.

655
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,213
Yep.

656
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,680
Visual Studio is your friend.

657
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,503
So how many people in
here understand Java?

658
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,690
Okay, so this will look familiar to you.

659
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,770
So this is basically a Java application

660
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,780
that was written called Beer Store,

661
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,300
which is an example application.

662
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,540
But what has been done here
is actually constructed it

663
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,500
to actually show the hierarchal key.

664
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,150
I wanted to start by just looking

665
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,400
at how those tenant data keys are created.

666
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,320
And then from that we'll take
a step back to understand

667
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,770
where that's stored in Dynamo
and where that's declared.

668
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,280
And then from a step back from
that, look at the actual KMS

669
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,010
so you can understand where the KMS ID

670
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,380
and those components are
configured and declared

671
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,090
that then get called down here.

672
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,890
But just so that you can
understand the context,

673
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,840
really seeing it from this perspective.

674
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,440
So if we look down here,

675
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,200
the most important part here is of course

676
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,040
you're gonna have KMS credentials,

677
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,803
of course, in this implementation.

678
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,640
So when you're onboarding a tenant,

679
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,720
each tenant's gonna get their own KMS ID,

680
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,200
their own client ID and credentials.

681
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,663
So this is so that each
one of your tenants,

682
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,330
will be able to understand
from a process perspective,

683
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,800
which one is used for which key.

684
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,440
Because for SaaS providers,
you wanna make sure each

685
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,350
customer that you have,
each tenant that you have

686
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,870
are actually being able
to manage their own keys

687
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,963
independently, not all on one cycle.

688
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,250
And we scroll down a
little bit further here

689
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,920
on that onboarding process.

690
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,250
Each of those is of course
gonna get a branch key

691
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,630
and then it's gonna have their credentials

692
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:24,033
within the application
that's going to call it.

693
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,140
And then when someone is offboarding,

694
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,370
because we are gonna cache those in Dynamo

695
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,450
and then they will age out.

696
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,440
So the caching in default
here is set to 15 minutes,

697
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,290
but it becomes deactivated
within the application.

698
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,310
They can no longer use it.

699
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,763
And then it comes out of
the Dynamo DV system itself.

700
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,293
So you can see that
thereafter it has expired.

701
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,590
And if we scroll down here, and of course

702
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,470
you're gonna see for the
rotation of each of the keys.

703
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,780
So of course if you're
going to have customers

704
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,250
managing their keys, you want them

705
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,860
to manage the rotation of those keys.

706
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,960
And each customer's going to, of course,

707
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,000
have different expectations of what

708
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,340
that rotation cycle should be,

709
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,740
based upon what their internal compliance

710
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,123
or security program requires
or compliance program requires.

711
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,330
Then scrolling down, we can see

712
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,920
how you might want to handle

713
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,080
multiple tenants data at a single time.

714
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,350
And so here's a key ring,

715
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,890
it's a multi-tenant key ring
handling multiple customers

716
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,430
at the same time, but each of
those are cached separately.

717
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,930
And each of those data streams,

718
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,980
one can't read the other

719
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,600
because each of those data streams,

720
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,900
even though it's being
handled by the same process,

721
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,780
each of those data streams
are only really readable

722
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,693
by the encryption and the
encryption key stored for it.

723
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,523
Make sense?

724
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,840
And then here at the very bottom

725
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,810
is if you have a customer,
and so you can support

726
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,390
both mechanisms because setting up

727
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,640
and establishing and maintaining KMS

728
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,043
can be a bit of a process bear.

729
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,740
From most customer's perspective,

730
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,840
when you're setting up key rings

731
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,190
and setting up those KMS keys,

732
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,680
holding them from a
multi-tenant perspective,

733
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,933
like the upper example here on 208,

734
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,260
makes a lot of sense.

735
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,197
But if you have a customer's like,

736
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:32,610
"No, I really want my KMS
to be in a single tenant

737
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,360
and it's only ever in the
process with only my data."

738
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,780
Then here's an example of
that just with a single tenant

739
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,603
within that key ring
being handled at one time.

740
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,600
So there's two ways of doing that.

741
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,400
Now, if we take a step
back, remember when I said

742
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,400
that in the Dynamo DB handle,
how that expiration works.

743
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,590
So here is actually setting
up that data key broker

744
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,700
for the Dynamo DB table.

745
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,380
And so you can see how each of
those for actually setting up

746
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,960
that those data objects is established.

747
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,830
And the important part down
here is really understanding

748
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,320
the coordination of those keys

749
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,780
for each tenant within Dynamo.

750
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,660
And then when you're
actually rotating them,

751
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,300
setting up your intermediate keys.

752
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,180
And then of course down here

753
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,630
is where you're actually
setting up your key ID

754
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,570
and the branch ID,
which is per each tenant

755
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,910
and then the encryption context

756
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,850
and the actual credential
provider that's being called

757
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,220
and can be defined in
the other Java object

758
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,110
we'll go into next.

759
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,630
And then for that branch key request,

760
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,193
how that's being called.

761
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,150
And once again just
explaining the default time,

762
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,070
which is here, how long you're
gonna hold on that delete.

763
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,530
In the actual sample
application it's 15 minutes.

764
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,420
It can be five minutes,
it can be one minute

765
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,460
how long you're gonna hold it cached.

766
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,460
And that caching will be,
if someone deletes it,

767
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,190
it will then no longer
be in Dynamo after that.

768
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,250
But it may mean that you're
going to make the request

769
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,010
to Dynamo more frequently
to refresh your cache.

770
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,780
So you have to hit that parameter

771
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,940
of how long do you wanna cache for,

772
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,370
'cause that will be when something
it's marked for deletion,

773
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,770
when it'll actually disappear from Dynamo.

774
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,580
But that also just means you have to

775
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,600
be querying Dynamo to
actually refresh your cache.

776
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,430
So it's really like what does
the application you're doing

777
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,710
and what does that mean
from a deletion perspective?

778
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,330
And letting that guide that.

779
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,480
Now if you have most of
your customers are happy

780
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,760
with say 15 minutes or five minutes,

781
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,310
but you have one customer
that it needs to be a minute,

782
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,870
then in that instance it might make sense

783
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,450
to have most of them under
the multi-tenant aspect

784
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,730
and then have the other one
on the single tenant aspect

785
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,250
that has that more reduced time phrase

786
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,990
so that you can handle their refresh

787
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,010
but not have to be refreshing

788
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,910
every tenant's keys at the same cycle.

789
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,953
Does that make sense to everyone?

790
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,963
Excellent.

791
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,580
So if we take a step back from that

792
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,920
to actually look at the KMS client.

793
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,300
So here you can actually see

794
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,240
how it's actually
establishing from the SDK

795
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,240
setting up the individual
KMS in keys, scrolling down,

796
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,930
that then the service
client will actually use

797
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,243
when the application is running.

798
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,763
Any questions?

799
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,630
It's pretty straightforward.

800
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,100
A lot of our security and
observability customers

801
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,070
use this as well as some
of our business apps.

802
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,880
So like Slack or Zoom and some others

803
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,100
also use the same sort of concept.

804
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,930
And really it's about how do I expose that

805
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,740
so the customer's providing
access appropriately to the KMS

806
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,003
so they're not having
to like plug in the ARN.

807
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,010
Peter was explaining earlier

808
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,940
how you can give them cloud
formation scripts to do that,

809
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,707
but on November 19th of this year,

810
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,850
pre re:Invent the IAM team announced

811
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,043
partner-managed delegated permissions.

812
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,300
Which actually makes
this a little bit easier

813
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,230
in the fact that within your
app, your SaaS application,

814
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,260
you can make a request via IAM.

815
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,990
Now in order to register,
you have to provide

816
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,540
policy boundary templates
that are approved

817
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,790
by AWS to the IAM team.

818
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,310
But what that is, is a scope down policy.

819
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,620
So then from your SaaS
platform, you can make a request

820
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:57,510
on the customer's behalf
to the administrator

821
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,720
or the user with the
appropriate permissions

822
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,830
into IAM for that administrator
to approve or deny.

823
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,680
And what that does is then from
then you can actually update

824
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,350
the permissions via cloud
formation or Terraform

825
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,440
leveraging that temporary delegation

826
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,440
to actually say deploy a role
or deploy sharing of KMS.

827
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,243
Right?

828
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:23,040
But it can only do that to
actually do it that one time.

829
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,340
But then after that point,

830
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,450
I know we talked about encrypt,
decrypt and generate key,

831
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,360
most observability and security providers

832
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,280
tend to just need decrypt

833
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,680
because they're not encrypting the key.

834
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,890
They want to decrypt it
so that they can read it

835
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,100
and then store it on their side

836
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,020
in the data store that they're using,

837
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,820
but they don't necessarily wanna wrap it

838
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,130
in an envelope on their side.

839
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,750
Then they make the request back

840
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,140
to actually read the data using your key.

841
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,210
So using that cross account role,

842
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,690
but they never want to do
actually any physical encrypting

843
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,150
or you wouldn't wanna do
any physical encrypting

844
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,883
of additional data because
that can be a bit risky,

845
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,590
or generate the keys using their key.

846
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,480
The customer should always
generate those keys.

847
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,010
So there are different
things you wanna think about

848
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,500
from your application's
perspective in the design.

849
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,940
What do you really need

850
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,030
and is it something you just
need in order to set up,

851
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,630
in which case you can use a
partner delegated permission

852
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,850
or request for a one-time action,

853
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,820
and then with permission boundaries.

854
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,400
Or is it something that
you're going to want

855
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,400
a general rule for encrypt
or decrypt or generate keys?

856
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,220
But there are ways you
can spread that out.

857
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,860
So at any one point in time you can give

858
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,860
that granular access to your customer.

859
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,220
But what I think is really powerful

860
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,440
is the ability for you to then make

861
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,080
those specific requests
and policy statements

862
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,920
so the customer can make those choices.

863
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,040
So you're not having the
friction of having them

864
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,010
go talk to the DevOps
person to provide the script

865
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,840
to the template to the right account.

866
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,880
It'll initiate it in
the appropriate account

867
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,823
for that appropriate
admin to approve or deny.

868
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,780
So I think combining these
capabilities together

869
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,590
gives you the ISV, the
ability to help customers

870
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,420
be able to bring their own keys

871
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,290
but do it in a way that
makes the most sense

872
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,427
and always encouraging our
ISV partners to build on AWS

873
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:31,740
so you can use KMS where appropriate.

874
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,560
And then still if the customer does have

875
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,830
an on-prem key store,
being able to access that

876
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,570
by leveraging the KMS
construct to import as well.

877
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,730
Any other questions?

878
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,563
Yes.

879
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,370
- [Audience Member] With branch keys,

880
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,827
do you see any pushback from customers

881
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:52,770
who are like super hyped
up on observability

882
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,780
where, you know, you're
kind of caching the key,

883
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,573
not showing every (indistinct) logging?

884
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,430
- [Peter] I think you can
have a patient conversation

885
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,690
with the customer to explain.

886
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,780
So the question there is
right with branch keys

887
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,790
because you're not going
back to KMS every time,

888
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,470
you're not gonna get KMS CloudTrail events

889
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,030
for all the cool things.

890
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,080
True.

891
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,300
I think customers, I'd like to believe,

892
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,700
maybe this is me being a
naive solutions architect

893
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,100
who always believes I could convince

894
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,570
someone of something if I'm right.

895
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,190
But the question is ultimately
if you want hyperscale

896
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,530
and performance, you can't emit logging

897
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,660
every time you touch something.

898
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,340
I think it shouldn't probably
be at the top of your list,

899
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,230
but you could admit your own logging.

900
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,063
- [Jenn] 100%

901
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:41,010
You should always prevent for
being providing the telemetry.

902
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,770
And those actions,
because it's also in here.

903
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,300
I scrolled past it,

904
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,510
but you're also logging
the number of times

905
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,423
your application's making use of that key.

906
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,390
And then of course that would be

907
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,390
emitted in your logs of your application.

908
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,290
- [Peter] But I would tell you, you know,

909
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,197
the question of caching anything is like,

910
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:03,840
'cause this also maybe undermines
the big red button, right?

911
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,110
If I'm caching, if I
invented a new top key

912
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,390
and I've got that clear top key,

913
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,090
the big red button goes away,
a lot of things go away.

914
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,710
Your colleagues in your security team

915
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,630
and your application security team

916
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,820
and the people that are
doing your SOC report

917
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,320
should all have strong
opinions about this, right?

918
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,920
Caching is one thing,
committing that top key

919
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,650
to non-volatile storage and clear, right?

920
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,850
There's a lot of things that

921
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,103
of course you should
not be doing, but yes.

922
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,897
- Yes.

923
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:43,533
- I just wanted to add (indistinct).

924
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,840
- [Peter] Kevin Lee, one of
the product managers for KMS.

925
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,965
- [Jenn] Yes.

926
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:50,632
(Kevin speaks indistinctly)

927
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,230
Make sure that you still
have permission (indistinct).

928
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:03,842
The time frame (indistinct)

929
00:44:05,984 --> 00:44:08,280
- [Peter] Right. Yeah, that's
a really interesting point.

930
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,570
I think the point that
Kevin's making there

931
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,330
is that there are somewhat
out of band ways to check

932
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,590
to see if you still have the authorization

933
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,600
in the first place and you
could use that as a signal

934
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,623
to drop the cache.

935
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,710
Right. Did I repeat that back okay?

936
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:24,810
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

937
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,060
- [Jenn] I couldn't hear.

938
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,860
- [Peter] Should we do more questions?

939
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,180
- [Jenn] Yeah. Huh?

940
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,830
- [Peter] The question is
should we do more questions?

941
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,963
- [Jenn] Yeah, 100%. Ask your questions.

942
00:44:36,146 --> 00:44:40,646
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

943
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:50,781
between security key and (indistinct)

944
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:55,781
outside organization
especially (indistinct).

945
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,180
Create your own key (indistinct)

946
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,680
Essentially (indistinct).

947
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:15,546
The only way you can provide true security

948
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:20,546
is you hold your own key. (indistinct)

949
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,980
- [Jenn] Well, I mean, so like you could,

950
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,780
that was one of the
examples that we showed

951
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,127
is you own your own key
and or hold your own key.

952
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:42,270
And here, each of the
processes has access to it,

953
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,070
but the admins don't have access

954
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,470
to the processes themselves.

955
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,744
- [Peter] Well said.

956
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,430
- [Jenn] (laughs) So it's kind
of, it's one of these things

957
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:55,430
that, it might be a digression,
but I happen to do it a lot.

958
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,420
It's when we're talking
about AI and agents,

959
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,580
people like to think of them as people

960
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,010
and I beg you stop
thinking of them that way.

961
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,020
Think of them as processes.

962
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,853
Right?

963
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:09,570
And if you think about them as processes

964
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,660
because that's what they
are, then it's making sure

965
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,930
that only that process ever
has access to that component.

966
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,750
And how do I architect
a solution to ensure

967
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,750
that process only has access
to that data and those keys

968
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,650
and another process never has it

969
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,060
nor can it hand the data over.

970
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,893
- [Peter] Right.

971
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:30,450
I mean the notional idea
of ownership, right?

972
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,080
Without pulling apart the
ontological concept of ownership.

973
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,200
If it's the customer's key
and the customer's account,

974
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,930
that to me is as strong
of an ownership model

975
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,910
as if it's in their own building.

976
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,110
You know, I work here but
I'm very passionate about it.

977
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,223
You own your data.

978
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:50,250
So if you put an object into S3,

979
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,110
is it any less yours

980
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,100
than if that same file

981
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,540
was in a file system in your building?

982
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,020
No, it's absolutely still yours.

983
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,740
I think XKS is, I kind kidded that earlier

984
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,673
is a warm blanket,

985
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,610
but to me it is still
very much your own key

986
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,410
if it is in your account

987
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,690
and the ISV has cross
account authorization

988
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,743
to make use of it.

989
00:47:15,055 --> 00:47:16,403
- [Audience Member] My main point is

990
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:21,403
it doesn't give you extra
security. (indistinct)

991
00:47:25,085 --> 00:47:30,042
Doesn't it's secure. (indistinct)

992
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,800
- [Peter] But that's a path that leads to,

993
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,820
well you don't own your own data

994
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,010
if you're hiring an ISV
to process the data.

995
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,360
And that can't be true.

996
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,370
'Cause then none of you
would have businesses, right?

997
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,690
Like, so the boundaries of ownership

998
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,480
to my taste are if
you're accepting the idea

999
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,500
that you're gonna hire an ISV
to do stuff with your data,

1000
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,080
you are already through
that looking glass.

1001
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,720
You are already asking
them to touch your data.

1002
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,726
- [Jenn] And that's also
where you start to say,

1003
00:47:56,726 --> 00:47:58,830
make sure if they're gonna do
any processing on that data,

1004
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,100
what security and compliance
have they gone through?

1005
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,933
- Right.
- You know,

1006
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:04,410
do they have ISO certification?

1007
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,453
Do they have-
- A competent SOC 2 program?

1008
00:48:07,453 --> 00:48:08,430
- Correct.
- Yeah.

1009
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,930
- [Jenn] I like to go further than SOC 2,

1010
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,915
but to each their own.
- Sure.

1011
00:48:11,915 --> 00:48:16,800
But table sticks. Table sticks.

1012
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,060
- [Jenn] Because what that does

1013
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,800
is you have a third party auditor

1014
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,901
coming in and validating those controls

1015
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,480
that are put into place

1016
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,740
- [Peter] That's right.

1017
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,000
- [Jenn] That they're handling the data

1018
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,550
and making sure that the
employees never have access

1019
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,653
and the processes themselves
never write out data,

1020
00:48:36,094 --> 00:48:38,220
and not any of that activity is logged in,

1021
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,990
which you have that telemetry.

1022
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,210
- [Peter] Yeah, but I
think I heard you say

1023
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,960
for so long as the ISV has the
authorization to use the key,

1024
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,010
you've got a security problem.

1025
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,390
I can't accept that.

1026
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:52,230
'Cause again, I hired
the ISV to touch my data.

1027
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,160
- [Jenn] Right.

1028
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,690
And also that's why I was saying

1029
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,790
it depends on what your
application's doing.

1030
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,450
So if I'm writing something
and I only ever write,

1031
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:03,360
then I should only have encrypt, right?

1032
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,082
On behalf of the customer.

1033
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:06,220
- [Peter] And generate data key.

1034
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,170
- [Jenn] Right. And generate the key.

1035
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,430
If all I'm ever doing is
reading it from say you're a sim

1036
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,350
or detection and response,

1037
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,888
I should only ever be able to read it.

1038
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:16,740
- Right.
- I should never be able

1039
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,750
to actually write it or generate

1040
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,190
a key for it.
- That's a great point.

1041
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,780
- [Jenn] And so making
sure that you understand

1042
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,700
what the action is

1043
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,860
and making sure that you don't
give permission beyond that

1044
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,590
and there's an appropriate
permission boundary

1045
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,453
in place in addition to those things.

1046
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
- [Peter] Well said.

1047
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,218
- Yes. Oh yeah 100%.

1048
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,487
- [Audience Member] So how do you deal

1049
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:41,137
with different customers
with different requirements?

1050
00:49:42,664 --> 00:49:44,223
I get that some customers are gonna be,

1051
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:45,720
"Oh, I wanna hold my own key.

1052
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,040
I want to do it in KMS
and I'm an avid AWS user."

1053
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,180
So that's fine.

1054
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,365
While others are gonna be, "I don't know

1055
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,740
what you're talking about
and I don't use AWS.

1056
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,990
I don't have an account."

1057
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,670
How do you usually deal with that.

1058
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,310
- [Peter] I think my short
answer to that is build to KMS

1059
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,810
and if customers wanna hold their own key,

1060
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,430
there's a way to do that with KMS.

1061
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,950
- [Jenn] Right. And and
it's abstracted from you.

1062
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,783
- [Peter] Right.

1063
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:14,463
- [Audience Member] Does that impact

1064
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:17,735
how you interact with the APIs?

1065
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:21,633
- [Peter] It doesn't change
any of the API contracts.

1066
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,460
XKS, the external key store
where it lives in an HSM

1067
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,813
in your office building or data center.

1068
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:33,090
It does have implications
for performance. Right?

1069
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,610
If you're operating a petascale data lake

1070
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:39,300
with 1,000 nodes banging on it.

1071
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,680
- And globally,
- Right.

1072
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,190
And you have to go back
to the HSM every time.

1073
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,380
- Or you have to go to an on-prem HSM

1074
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,700
going for a network connection

1075
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,100
and you have a really small caching time.

1076
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,480
- Right.
- Yeah.

1077
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,520
- [Jenn] I mean this is where
it starts to become important.

1078
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,810
The caching discussion.

1079
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,440
Just like in for a
database itself, you know,

1080
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,710
you sometimes have to cache the
most frequently asked things

1081
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,480
and that's why you set a time to live.

1082
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,460
Same thing for DNS.

1083
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,900
You set time to live

1084
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,600
because I need to cache the
fully qualified domain names.

1085
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,440
Now if I have very dynamic IPs

1086
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,120
for load balancers and things like that,

1087
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,400
my time to live is probably in seconds.

1088
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,570
Right?

1089
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:21,390
But if I'm sitting at the
top of the name space,

1090
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,207
my time to live might be 24 hours.

1091
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:24,060
- Right.
- Right?

1092
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,310
And so it's really understanding

1093
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,790
that from a KMS perspective

1094
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,030
and architecting that in
a way that makes sense

1095
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,840
based upon where the customer determines

1096
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,673
where they want to,

1097
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:39,360
how long and where it's being stored

1098
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,440
and you as the provider.

1099
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,270
That's why I'm saying like it might be

1100
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,920
for that really particular customer,

1101
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,360
it's that bottom example.

1102
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,750
And that time to live has to
be longer because it's on-prem.

1103
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,720
And I have to take into effect the fact

1104
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,550
that every time I clear my cache,

1105
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,620
I'm gonna have to pull it back

1106
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,587
and then I need to make sure
it's distributed, right?

1107
00:51:57,587 --> 00:51:59,937
And so I have to architect
to account for that.

1108
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,763
- [Peter] But to summarize the answer,

1109
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:09,180
the characteristic of the
key, XKS, custom key store,

1110
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,760
regular KMS, does not
change API interactions.

1111
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,987
- [Jenn] It doesn't. Yeah.

1112
00:52:12,987 --> 00:52:15,240
- [Peter] It can change
performance characteristics.

1113
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,180
And availability
characteristics of the results.

1114
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,403
- 100%.

1115
00:52:20,953 --> 00:52:23,790
That's why I'm saying that
the multi-tenant one above,

1116
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,530
most of the time that makes sense.

1117
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,363
Right?

1118
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:27,660
If I have one that then is

1119
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,335
that particular customer
is gonna be on-prem,

1120
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,280
they wanna hold their own key,

1121
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,670
I am not having that
impact the other tenants.

1122
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,600
Does that make sense?

1123
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,670
- [Audience Member] Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. (indistinct)

1124
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,620
Probably on the onboarding side

1125
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,447
there's gonna be lots
of different processes

1126
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:44,610
for different requirements.

1127
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,580
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And onboarding a new client.

1128
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,747
- [Jenn] Yeah.

1129
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,533
Yes.

1130
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,873
- I have a question.
- Please.

1131
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:00,119
- [Audience Member] So I'm used
to thinking in terms of data

1132
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:01,410
and key encrypt.

1133
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,760
So now my data's encrypted.

1134
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,079
We talked about rotation (indistinct)

1135
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,372
and I'm having trouble getting past that.

1136
00:53:10,372 --> 00:53:12,622
That hurdle of now I've
got a petabyte of data

1137
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:13,610
that's been encrypted.

1138
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,540
- [Peter] So we are very opinionated about

1139
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,210
what rotation is and what it is not.

1140
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,360
A lot of people think of
rotation as if I rotate,

1141
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,940
then I'm gonna destroy the previous key,

1142
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,970
which necessitates
re-encrypting all the data

1143
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,980
so that it's now protected by the new key.

1144
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,393
That is not how we do it.

1145
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,050
Historically, again, I'm very
opinionated bit about this.

1146
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,120
So let me get through this quickly.

1147
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,580
Historically you rotated for two reasons.

1148
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,770
Number one, humans had access to it.

1149
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,930
And now that human left the building.

1150
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,940
We don't have that problem with KMS.

1151
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,460
Nobody ever touches
those keys. Not even us.

1152
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,160
There is no way for us to
access your key material.

1153
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,620
The other reason you
rotate is crypto wear out.

1154
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,320
I used the same key for all this data

1155
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,300
and now I need another one.

1156
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,650
The envelope encryption pattern
addresses both problems.

1157
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,900
That the blast radius of an individual key

1158
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,360
is necessarily very, very narrow,

1159
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,110
'cause it's typically per
resource or per file or whatever.

1160
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:15,110
And there is no such thing as
getting the key out of KMS.

1161
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,170
Like there's no API

1162
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,633
to dematerial.
- You can't export.

1163
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,483
- [Peter] And even if you could,

1164
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:22,290
you couldn't make use of it.

1165
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,800
What we do when we rotate
is, I mentioned earlier

1166
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,740
that the idea of the CMK, the ARN

1167
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,773
is itself effectively a vessel,

1168
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,040
inside of that is the real key material.

1169
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,000
If you turn on rotation
on a periodic basis,

1170
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,370
I think by default a year.

1171
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,870
And did we ever lower the
period for that? We did?

1172
00:54:44,879 --> 00:54:47,160
- 30 days to 7 years.
- There you go.

1173
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,633
30 days to 7 years.

1174
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,440
This whole week there's
gonna be new things.

1175
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,690
And it's hard for us too.

1176
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,950
At that rotation period
we create new key material

1177
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,740
that will be used for future encrypt

1178
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,120
and generate data key events.

1179
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,570
We keep the old key material.

1180
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,890
Because if we didn't, we would have

1181
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,490
to go re-encrypt a giant body
of data, which is expensive

1182
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,250
and time consuming and
really hard to get right

1183
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,900
because of edge cases.

1184
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,443
And if we got rid of the key material,

1185
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:19,350
it would be very dangerous.

1186
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,563
So when we rotate, we just
generate new key material

1187
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:25,500
that is used for new
cryptographic operations,

1188
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,580
but we keep the old one.

1189
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,756
- [Jenn] Right.

1190
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:29,483
And it's really important because if ever,

1191
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,870
that's why the retention for seven years,

1192
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,390
is if you ever have to go back in time

1193
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,760
to go look at data from a period of time

1194
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,930
where it was previously written,

1195
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,822
you need to be able to read that.

1196
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:42,655
- [Peter] That's right.

1197
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:43,488
- [Jenn] And so that might be something

1198
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:44,940
that's historically stored in Glacier,

1199
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,760
but it's still attached to that older key

1200
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,140
for when it was created.

1201
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,400
So then when you need to access it,

1202
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,980
you as the owner of it

1203
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,560
when the application's
making the call can still,

1204
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,417
it can go look back on that point in time.

1205
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,130
- [Peter] But let me restate the two big

1206
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,780
punchlines though to this topic.

1207
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,970
Number one, the envelope
encryption pattern

1208
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,950
takes away-
- All that complexity.

1209
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,030
- [Peter] Off the table the reasons

1210
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,310
to even think about rotation ever.

1211
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,330
Full stop.

1212
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,310
Number two, we have a rotation thing

1213
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,193
that you can turn on and
make somebody in audit happy.

1214
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,420
- [Jenn] And you don't need to worry about

1215
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,040
how do I then go back in time

1216
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,070
and use the key that
goes back and does that.

1217
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,510
It's being taken care of for you.

1218
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,343
- [Peter] Right.

1219
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,367
But if you encounter a colleague who says,

1220
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:30,630
"No, we need new data encryption keys

1221
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,897
and we're gonna rewrap
and rekey all the data."

1222
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,053
That person is wrong.

1223
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:46,387
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

1224
00:57:14,112 --> 00:57:18,445
So what I'm asking is (indistinct).

1225
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:30,067
So what is the solution
for that? (indistinct)

1226
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:32,050
- [Peter] So what I think I heard was

1227
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,000
you've got a kind of set of
competing interests, right?

1228
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,260
You want to encrypt everything,

1229
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,500
but there are trade-offs
that you want to work around.

1230
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,180
Let's talk about some of those trade-offs.

1231
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,880
The classic one is searching, right?

1232
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,380
That's the biggest problem.

1233
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,140
If I wanna have a column
in a relational data store

1234
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,263
of taxpayer ID, social security
number in this country.

1235
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:57,600
But I also wanna look up
customers by taxpayer.

1236
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,950
It's not a great way to do that.

1237
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,270
There are vanguard, cutting edge

1238
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,540
homomorphic encryption options

1239
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,070
that are just finally starting
to really become real.

1240
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,390
There were some talks this week.

1241
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,820
We hired a trio of cryptographers,

1242
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,590
this lovely interesting group of people

1243
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,480
that have worked together for 20 years.

1244
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,223
Tal Rabin, Hugo,

1245
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,480
I'm gonna blank on their
names, which is embarrassing.

1246
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,228
- [Jenn] There's people
like Robert Alcorn and Avni

1247
00:58:27,228 --> 00:58:28,061
over on the crypto team.

1248
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:28,894
- [Peter] Yeah.

1249
00:58:28,894 --> 00:58:31,200
But the searchable encryption
thing is out there.

1250
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,863
You can kind of search across
encrypted fields these days.

1251
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:38,220
It's not super high performance.

1252
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,900
I wouldn't put it in the hot path

1253
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,840
for a really high TPS application.

1254
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,520
But there are some ways to do that.

1255
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,480
Deterministic encryption for
particularly narrow key spaces

1256
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,360
like a social security number,
like a credit card number,

1257
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,430
can be super dangerous

1258
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:58,200
because social security
numbers are super predictable.

1259
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,010
If you know when and
where someone was born,

1260
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,260
you've already lost half of
the social security number,

1261
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,460
it's very predictable.

1262
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,750
Same with credit card numbers.

1263
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,180
Because of CVV too, there's
like an internal check sum

1264
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,610
to the format of a credit card number

1265
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,580
and the first six digits belong to banks.

1266
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,190
And so the key spaces get
really narrow really fast,

1267
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:20,130
which means it's trivial
to create a rainbow table

1268
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,010
of all possible values.

1269
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,860
So you gotta be very careful
at deterministic encryption.

1270
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:32,261
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

1271
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,400
It's getting there. It's getting there.

1272
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,850
But again, the larger the field is

1273
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:48,210
and if the cardinality of the field blooms

1274
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:52,320
like a free text field, then
all the promises fall apart.

1275
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,940
If the cardinality of
the encrypted payload

1276
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,990
that you're attempting to search across

1277
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:00,990
is relatively finite, the
solution works much better.

1278
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,200
But if it's like, I want
to encrypt all the notes

1279
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,900
from the call center, but still search it,

1280
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,550
no, that's not gonna happen.

1281
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:13,140
But could I encrypt addresses
and still search across it?

1282
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,640
Yeah, probably.

1283
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,690
And the database,

1284
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,500
SDK implements this for
Dynamo, that's available today.

1285
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,050
Searchable encryption in
Dynamo is available today.

1286
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,290
Again, it comes with a pile of asterisks

1287
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,110
that you and your engineering
team should investigate.

1288
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,120
But it's cool and it works.

1289
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,932
We have customers using it.

1290
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:35,730
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

1291
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,703
- [Peter] With the AWS
database encryption SDK.

1292
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,883
Yeah. It's pretty cool.

1293
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,990
And you should have your
account team follow up with us.

1294
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,560
Like the team that is working
on this kind of vanguard

1295
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,200
of exploring stuff is
very interested in talking

1296
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,593
to customers and hearing use cases, right?

1297
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:01,641
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

1298
01:01:04,842 --> 01:01:05,910
Tell your account team you're interested

1299
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,770
in having a conversation
about homomorphic encryption.

1300
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,503
If you search the session
catalog for homomorphic,

1301
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,400
you'll find the sessions.

1302
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,400
I'm pretty sure Tal and Raj
are talking about it this week.

1303
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,263
Tal Rabin, who leads that trio.

1304
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,890
This trio of cryptographers,
they all have Wikipedia pages,

1305
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,060
if that helps contextualize

1306
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,860
who they are and what they're about.

1307
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,460
Yeah, we're doing some
really cool stuff there.

1308
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,650
- [Jenn] All right. So we've
reached the end of the time.

1309
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,270
The red light is flashing.

1310
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,400
So thank you all for coming.

1311
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,220
Hope you found this very informative.

1312
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,630
Please fill out the survey

1313
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,630
and let us know how you liked it,

1314
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:46,230
and we look forward to
talking to you guys more.

1315
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,553
- [Peter] Cool.
