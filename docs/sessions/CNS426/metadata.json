  "abstract": "Imagine an application that changes its deployment form while maintaining its essential nature—a digital shapeshifter adapting to any AWS compute environment. This session unveils the architectural patterns enabling true deployment flexibility, transforming applications to flow seamlessly between Lambda functions, ECS containers, and EKS pods. Through practical demonstrations, discover design principles that separate business logic from infrastructure concerns, creating applications that leverage AWS's specialized services without becoming tightly coupled. Learn to craft adaptable applications that maintain their core functionality while thriving in any AWS compute environment.",
  "abstract_cn": "想象一个应用程序在保持其本质特性的同时改变其部署形式——一个数字变形者，能够适应任何AWS计算环境。本次会议揭示了实现真正部署灵活性的架构模式，将应用程序转换为在Lambda函数、ECS容器和EKS Pod之间无缝流动。通过实际演示，发现将业务逻辑与基础设施关注点分离的设计原则，创建能够利用AWS专业化服务而不会紧密耦合的应用程序。学习如何构建适应性强的应用程序，在任何AWS计算环境中都能保持其核心功能并蓬勃发展。",
