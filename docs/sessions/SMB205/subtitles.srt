1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,010
- Good afternoon everyone,
and welcome to the session.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,960
Great to see so many people here today.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,880
My name's Bharat Mistry.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,140
I work for Trend Micro.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,030
And over the 40, 45 minutes,

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,230
we're gonna kind of look at
why it's important to recognize

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,200
that actually cyber
risk is a business risk

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,929
and something that needs to be
tackled in a business manner.

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,450
And what we're gonna do

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,100
is we're gonna dive into a
number of things actually.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,560
I suppose in today's cloud
and really, AI driven world,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,450
innovation growth has to go
hand in hand with security,

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,810
especially when we look at
the regulatory landscape

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,880
that sits right now around AI,

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,010
the privacy, the data and everything.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,970
They have to go together

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,270
because breaches can
become expensive, right?

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,510
The question is how do
you manage that innovation

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,910
and growth without that disruption?

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,710
And that's what this session aims to do,

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,210
is to kind of look at some
strategies around that.

22
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:08,580
What we'll do is we'll cover
some practical insights,

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,580
some real world outcomes,
and really kind of how AWS

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,490
and Trend Micro can empower
proactive risk management

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,070
because that's the kind of
the name of the game here.

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,720
And we'll take a kind of
meandering tour as we go through,

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,070
and we'll look at really

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,130
what does today's security
environment look like,

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,292
the approaches that have been adopted,

30
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,100
and the problems that it has created

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,693
for all organizations, right?

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,440
We'll then think about the
mind shift change required

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,753
to go to proactive and
why we wanna do that.

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,670
We'll look at things
like communicating risk

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,860
to non-technical stakeholders,

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,334
so outside of the security
team or the IT team,

37
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:56,910
and really why something like
a platform-based approach

38
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,420
is really needed to kind
of have a true visibility

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,430
of your enterprise and what's going on.

40
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,040
And we'll finally end
off with a case study

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,070
with Northeast Georgia Health System

42
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,560
who are actually
transforming cyber security

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,053
in their environment to
be a business enabler.

44
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,010
Hopefully, we'll have some time at the end

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,593
for some Q&A as well, so
let's see how we go on.

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,990
So in light of kind of recent
high profile cyber attacks

47
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,430
that we've seen, like certainly in the UK,

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,550
most people will know about
Jaguar and Land Rover.

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,290
I think recently in the US
with Bridgestone as well.

50
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,180
It's had some major impact.

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,850
If we look at just JLR,

52
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,803
the direct impact on
them was $220 million,

53
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,600
five weeks loss of production.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,600
So you can imagine the
state of that organization,

55
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,460
everything shut down for five weeks.

56
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,293
That's huge, right?

57
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:04,020
For a manufacturer where
you've got piling stock,

58
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,160
you wanna get that money out,

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,410
you've gotta sell those assets.

60
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,320
More importantly, you've gotta
think about the disruption

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,540
to the supply chain as well.

62
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,690
In many cases, some of
those niche suppliers

63
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,793
that supply JLR have gone bust.

64
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,140
So not only is it an impact
on you as an organization,

65
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,763
but who do you partner with?

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,760
And then really lastly,

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,140
it's the cost to get
them out that situation.

68
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,140
They had to take a 1.5 billion
pound loan from UK government

69
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,690
to kind of rectify the situation.

70
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,373
So you can see in every
boardroom right now,

71
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,590
it's become a war room
for managing cyber risk.

72
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,900
And I suppose we need
to kind of peel back,

73
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,763
what do we mean by cyber risk?

74
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,323
I think at its core, it's
really an operational risk.

75
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,540
We've gotta think about moving
the conversation beyond IT

76
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,640
or beyond technology

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,180
and moving it back into an
operational kind of context.

78
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,083
And I'll give a bit bit
of detail behind this.

79
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,292
So for example, in the UK,

80
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,952
the National Cybersecurity Center,

81
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:26,100
they're calling and they wanna advocate

82
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,710
something called resilience engineering

83
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,050
or business resilience.

84
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,880
And this is where cyber needs to come in

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
because it's about the ability

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,610
to provide core and critical services

87
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,453
and applications whilst
under any kind of disruption,

88
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,422
being able to absorb that pressure

89
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,933
and maintain those critical
services whilst under attack.

90
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,910
That's very different to
where cyber's being seen.

91
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,206
Cybersecurity has always been
about prevention in the past,

92
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,250
but what we are looking to do now

93
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,110
as we talk about business risk,

94
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,510
it's moving it into a
conversation around resilience

95
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,470
and into business continuity,

96
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,020
'cause that's the name of
the game now I would say.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,570
Certainly, on the
resilience side of things,

98
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,320
it's very much a differentiator.

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,440
And just going back to
what the NCSE was saying,

100
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,150
they're actually advocating
that in worse case scenarios,

101
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,340
you assume that no IT is available

102
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,893
and you have to go back
to paper-based systems.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,320
And that's quite a big step,

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,181
and a bold step that needs
to be tested and tried.

105
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:41,460
And it tells you this is more
than just a technology issue.

106
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,573
It is now become a people
and a process issue as well.

107
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,990
And these are the kind of differentiators

108
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,433
that really start to matter.

109
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,080
So when we think about the reality

110
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,270
of modern cyber risk.

111
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,640
Actually, before I talk
about the risk itself,

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,620
if you think about most organizations,

113
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,210
there are four pillars

114
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,200
that the board will always
focus and center on, right?

115
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,210
First it's growth, right?

116
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,490
Having that revenue, going
back to shareholders,

117
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,680
and making sure that we
are growing the business

118
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
in the right way.

119
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,650
Hence we've got kind of
innovation through cloud

120
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,030
and AI happening right now

121
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,230
is to give you that
competitive edge, right?

122
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
That growth is underpinned
by customer trust.

123
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,860
That's the fuel factor

124
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,380
that drives the growth
engine for any organization.

125
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,970
If you've got trust in your customers,

126
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,855
they're gonna buy from you,
they're gonna innovate with you

127
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,333
and take that forward.

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,640
And customer trust is
largely based on compliance.

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,300
They wanna know that anything
that they're acquiring,

130
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,990
they're buying, they're
using is compliant.

131
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,800
So if you buy, for example,
any electronics in the UK,

132
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,140
you'll always get a CE badge

133
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,690
to tell you it's at a certain level

134
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,910
or a certain standard, right?

135
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,880
And then lastly, it's
around operational risk

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,443
or operational resilience.

137
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,200
And the factor

138
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,410
that connects all of these
four pillars together

139
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,300
is cyber risk.

140
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,090
Because if you get cyber risk wrong

141
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,250
and you don't manage it in the right way,

142
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,250
it has a direct impact on all of them.

143
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,770
Just going back to the
growth pillar alone,

144
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,503
it can severely hamper innovation.

145
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,520
By any breach, it could lead
to a compliance friction,

146
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,070
it could lead to other activities

147
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,763
which you would never foreseen
and delay that go to market.

148
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:44,310
Same in things like regulations as well.

149
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,950
Regulations are getting
tighter as I spoke about,

150
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,170
and having a breach has a
material impact on that,

151
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,540
which is linked to the
operational resilience

152
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,230
because any outage will carry downtime,

153
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,890
and potentially high costs as well.

154
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,720
Not just loss in business,

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,330
but also penalties that
could come out of it as well.

156
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,810
So you can see, cyber risk
is a integrating factor

157
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,260
that kind of drives all
of these things together.

158
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,170
So the question really
now comes to saying,

159
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,723
well, why does it matter right now?

160
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,573
And there are a number

161
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,380
of different things behind this, right?

162
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,080
It kind of, I suppose at its base level,

163
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,030
it kind of signals the start

164
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,830
of what we call shared
responsibility and accountability

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,160
where cybersecurity outcomes
influence executive pay

166
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,573
and corporate governance.

167
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,890
So let's just take a step back here.

168
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,630
What was just an IT issue

169
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,510
is now being taken right up the stack,

170
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,173
right up to the board.

171
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,780
And I would say every business
unit owner is accountable

172
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,750
for the data and the systems they manage.

173
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,410
And if you wanna see a
real world example of this,

174
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,040
Qantas, they cut executive bonuses

175
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,370
by 15% recently on the back of the breach

176
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,333
that they suffered.

177
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,230
So you can see that
corporate responsibility

178
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,460
is going all the way to the top.

179
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,463
So there's a vested
interest at the board level.

180
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,860
Cyber risk is no longer delegated,

181
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,590
it's actually collectively owned.

182
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,560
And going back to what I said earlier,

183
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,010
it's gotta go hand in hand
with that innovation and growth

184
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,730
to have that security element there.

185
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,949
And when we think about
this innovation and growth,

186
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:41,610
this is a hot theme right now.

187
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,960
AI is reshaping every
business as we see right now,

188
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,960
new business models, new insights,
new go to markets, right?

189
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,460
It's allowing you to do things
faster, quicker, cheaper.

190
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,413
But as you can see from the stats,

191
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
there are some concerns here, right?

192
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,310
We see two kind of two
sides to a coin I would say.

193
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,480
On the one hand, we see
in organizations use AI

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,290
to boost that kind of
efficiency and competitive edge.

195
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,280
But on the other hand,

196
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,520
and you can see the figure up
there, 93% express a concern

197
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,450
around the increased security risks

198
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,210
both by not only internal use,

199
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,830
but also third party developed capability.

200
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,110
I talked about the supply chain earlier,

201
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,860
and in this context, it's
that software supply chain,

202
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,050
that software bill of materials.

203
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,030
How do you know what the exposure is?

204
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,300
How do you vet what is coming
into your organization,

205
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,050
and what does it leave you open to?

206
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,950
This duality underscores
the kind of balancing act

207
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,423
that organizations are under.

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,060
It goes back to my opening statement

209
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,480
about how do you manage
innovation and growth

210
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,590
with the right security

211
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,740
or the guardrails to
kind of get you there.

212
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,310
And I suppose what it boils down to really

213
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,265
is having some robust
risk management strategies

214
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:15,300
when integrating innovations like this

215
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,380
into your organization,

216
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,280
and that's what we're gonna dive into.

217
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Again, for a bit more context,

218
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,780
let's have a look at why
does this actually exist

219
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,543
and why is it so complex right now?

220
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,293
This is a picture

221
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:32,760
of the kind of what we
call the tax surface.

222
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,330
And I would say maybe five years ago,

223
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,250
probably been less than that.

224
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,093
Certainly pre-pandemic,
everything was on premise.

225
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,900
So from an organizational point of view,

226
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,910
you had your arms around all those assets,

227
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,950
you knew what you were controlling,

228
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,310
all your people were working in an office,

229
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,230
all your assets predominantly

230
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,400
would've been in the data center,

231
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,630
but there could be some in the cloud,

232
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,880
but you had a good handle
on what's going on.

233
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,080
Certainly, throughout the
pandemic and post-pandemic,

234
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,080
we've seen this accelerated
growth of the earth tax surface.

235
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,810
We've seen use of SaaS
applications at a level

236
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,860
that we've never seen before.

237
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,860
If you think about just AI
applications, ChatGPT, CoPilot,

238
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,790
and all that, over the
last kind of 15 months,

239
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,010
you've seen that acceleration.

240
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,480
I've talked about their supply chain

241
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,490
and third party already as well,

242
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,878
more and more as they become
digital in their nature.

243
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:32,850
How do you control,
how do you manage that,

244
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,200
how do you know what's going on?

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,245
Work from home is an attack surface

246
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:38,523
that has exploded I would say.

247
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,980
Organizations are struggling

248
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,260
to get their employees
back into the office

249
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,760
because hey, I could get up
at six o'clock in the morning,

250
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,690
do a couple of hours work,

251
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,793
and then have a good few hours off, right?

252
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Everyone wants that kind of flexibility.

253
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,845
But that home environment
alone introduces complexity.

254
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,360
If you think about the
devices that could be there,

255
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,920
there could be unmanaged devices,

256
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,510
you've got PlayStations on there, right?

257
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,443
You've got all these other
kits, people with smart fridges.

258
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,870
Why would you want a smart fridge?

259
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,480
I dunno, but it doesn't make sense.

260
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,100
But you can see that there
is an opportunity certainly

261
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,470
for a threat actor or a hostile person

262
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,590
to breach one of these devices.

263
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,180
And we've seen these reports already.

264
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,180
They're easily broken into,
home routers, smart TVs,

265
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,470
and then it's just a lateral hop

266
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,870
onto what would be a corporate device

267
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,270
and you tunnel back through.

268
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,630
IoT/OT, that's a known issue as well.

269
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,491
Cloud native apps and
services is on the incline.

270
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:47,940
The use of non sanctioned applications

271
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,280
and the risks they introduce as well.

272
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,113
And then lastly,

273
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:53,283
we've kind of spoken
about AI already, right?

274
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,820
So how have organizations tackled

275
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,323
managing this kind of
complexity in the past?

276
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,851
It's been done like this.

277
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,990
Actually, there's three
parts to the equation,

278
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,110
but they've always defaulted
to the easiest one.

279
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,181
It's really a people problem,
it's a process problem,

280
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:16,324
but everyone's jumped onto
the technology bandwagon

281
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,733
to address this problem.

282
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,723
And there's no kind of blame here.

283
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,540
I would say the people
to blame could be vendors

284
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,150
like Trend Micro, I suppose,
who create the hype,

285
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,051
say you need this technology,
there's a bit of FUD,

286
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:32,520
fear, uncertainty and
doubt in all of this,

287
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,233
and trying to promote those sales.

288
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,650
So what we end up doing
certainly as organizations,

289
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,580
we end up buying technology for specific,

290
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,980
very specific use cases.

291
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,290
If you think about it,
like on an endpoint,

292
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,055
you'll buy some anti-malware capability,

293
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,380
you might buy some DLP capability.

294
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,610
Lo and behold, someone says actually,

295
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,867
you need some EDR capability.

296
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:58,680
And all of a sudden, I've got
three tools on that end point.

297
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,900
We've seen organizations with firewalls.

298
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,480
There was a mantra,

299
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,770
I would say probably six years ago.

300
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,180
You need dual skin firewalls
from two different vendors

301
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,490
based on the kind of fear

302
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,380
that actually if one was compromised,

303
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,213
the other one wouldn't.

304
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,720
Or if there's a vulnerability
in one firewall,

305
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,970
they wouldn't be in the second, right?

306
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,110
And we see that through things

307
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,173
like sandboxing technology,
cloud technology.

308
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,320
And more often than not,

309
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,183
these are, I would say
dependent best of breed tools.

310
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,187
And you'd be right in
your mindset thinking,

311
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,680
"Oh, I'm gonna buy the best of breed,

312
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,110
it's gonna protect me for this."

313
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,140
And yeah, that's probably
the good way of doing it.

314
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,813
But the investment required is quite high.

315
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,760
And the real kind of proof
of the pudding is here,

316
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,270
when we are under attack
or even before an attack,

317
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,950
and we start to ask these questions,

318
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,635
and these aren't technical
questions, these are questions

319
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,650
that the board might ask or
a non-technical stakeholder.

320
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,213
We say are we in danger?

321
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,403
What happened?

322
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,430
How many resources have we got?

323
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,993
And what should I do next?

324
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,310
Invariably this happens, right?

325
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,690
You jump from console to
console, manual processes

326
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,760
because doing things, that's
the only way you could do it

327
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,673
unless you've got a team that
can do integration for you.

328
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,880
And the repeatability factor goes away

329
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,400
because that IPR sits
with that individual.

330
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,435
If you've got junior staff coming through,

331
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,510
how are they ever gonna learn?

332
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,940
Or they build their own kind of IPR stack.

333
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,540
The thing is, it's unique
in each environment

334
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,000
and you just cannot replicate that.

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,343
And we end up in this kind of scenario.

336
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,370
Risks, threats, and infections

337
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,443
are absolutely impossible to see.

338
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,113
Now, you imagine

339
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,830
that, that could be an
on-premise environment.

340
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,010
But what if you are in cloud, multi-cloud

341
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,020
and third parties as well?

342
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,700
How do you create that true picture?

343
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,053
It causes a problem, right?

344
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,103
And it leads to, I would say
this kind of scenario here,

345
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:11,190
leaders are struggling and
it's no real surprise, right?

346
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,390
When we are talking

347
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,140
and we are communicating
about risk, it comes down

348
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,312
to posture and understanding the posture.

349
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:20,970
These independent tools
don't give you that.

350
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,313
They give you alert and
telemetry information.

351
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,990
And that leads on to that second point.

352
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,903
It's demonstrating the
return on investment.

353
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,590
More often than not, certainly in my time,

354
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,840
I've worked with a lot of organizations

355
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,330
that have bought the latest and greatest,

356
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,740
and they've never deployed
anywhere near 30 to 40%

357
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,060
of their tech.

358
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,870
Not only the the licenses,
but the capabilities as well.

359
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,520
They've bought it for a very tiny use case

360
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,353
and they've never used it.

361
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,403
In some cases, it's
been left as shelfware.

362
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,000
So how do you demonstrate
that return on investment?

363
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And the last is really,
it's linking exposure back

364
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,050
to what I would say service chains

365
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,703
or those business critical assets.

366
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:09,840
I see something, I've got some technology

367
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,620
that I've got from this vendor,
something happens on there,

368
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,240
how do I know which tier
one services it's affecting?

369
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
How do I know it's not affecting my ERP?

370
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,060
How do I know it's not
affecting my e-commerce site

371
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,160
or anything like that?

372
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,583
So you can see where kind of leaders are

373
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,333
in this kind of situation.

374
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,960
And we'll kind of dive into some.

375
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,903
These are the challenges
that we see right now.

376
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,520
Those independent tools
that I talked about.

377
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,909
I've worked in organizations

378
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:45,903
where they've had 40 plus tools,

379
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,923
and it's meant

380
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:51,880
that they've had to have
three full-time employees

381
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,723
just doing tool maintenance.

382
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,316
Just think about that,
three FTEs just managing

383
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:03,240
and maintaining your
security infrastructure,

384
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,618
not doing any triage,
not doing any analysis,

385
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:09,030
they're just babysitting, watering

386
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,290
and feeding that environment.

387
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,840
I mean that's expensive, right?

388
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,610
Second problem is you've
got these siloed tools,

389
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,990
and you end up in this situation,

390
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,480
where you've got alert overload.

391
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,570
There's just so much coming through.

392
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,833
Where do you even begin?

393
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,520
How do you even actually say,

394
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,040
oh, a critical on this
tool here is the same

395
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,690
as a critical on that tool there.

396
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,720
Do the two of them come together,

397
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,483
and do you get a true
picture of what's happening?

398
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:42,180
You might do, you might not

399
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,770
unless you've done some integration.

400
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,470
So you end up with these visibility gaps

401
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,763
in your organization.

402
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:51,570
And it's kind of partly led

403
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,970
unless you've got those
complex integrations right

404
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,400
in the first place, it's a nightmare.

405
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,003
You think about when you
do a change in the stack,

406
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,690
the impact it could have.

407
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,173
So think about an endpoint.

408
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,650
You might have anti-malware,
you might have DLP,

409
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,933
you might have media
control, you might have EDR

410
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:15,390
and you might have a
management agent on there.

411
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,223
That's five, right?

412
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:20,283
So if you update one, what's
the impact on the others?

413
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,857
So you can see where we are,

414
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:24,810
and we end up this in this scenario

415
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,000
where costs are spiraling.

416
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,282
They're actually very high,

417
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:30,240
and the alignment back to the business,

418
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,190
going back to what I was saying
about exposure is very low.

419
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,090
So the result, you end up with this,

420
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,613
reactive security kind
of waste time and budget.

421
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,460
Reactive approaches, they
kind of lead to firefighting

422
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,873
after the incidents occur.

423
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,343
It's time consuming and it's expensive.

424
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,080
Unplanned responses often require,

425
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,003
I would say emergency fixes,

426
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,780
depending on whether
you can do it yourself

427
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,764
or whether you've got a service
organization to help you.

428
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:11,043
There is operational disruption
in all of this, I would say.

429
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,130
And it's no surprise, right?

430
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,880
Business leaders struggle
to quantify the exposure

431
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,820
and making it hard to
prioritize investment.

432
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,270
So when you're out there
saying we need this capability,

433
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,350
it's really difficult

434
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,350
because they just see this
as it's just sunken costs,

435
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,450
which isn't delivering any
value back to the business.

436
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,150
It's just a bottom line cost,
like an insurance policy

437
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,883
that you might use, you might not, right?

438
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,470
And without kind of I would
say measurable outcomes

439
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,340
and some predictive metrics,
security investments,

440
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,253
as I said, they don't
really mean anything.

441
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,719
So what do we actually need?

442
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,603
Lemme grab a sip of water.

443
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,000
We need to fundamentally kind
of rethink how we do security.

444
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,863
We need a mind shift change,

445
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,030
certainly to move away from where we are.

446
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,200
And I think really the best way to do this

447
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,540
is to really go up the stack again

448
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,540
and think about actually what
drives boardroom funding.

449
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,370
What is the board,

450
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,220
and what is a business
actually interested in?

451
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,090
And again, it comes down

452
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,600
to I would say these are
three core pillars I see.

453
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,710
There are others,

454
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,950
but it's materially down to these three.

455
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,533
It's around reducing that material risk.

456
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,630
I'm not talking about cyber,

457
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,790
I'm talking about risk across the board.

458
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,956
All organizations have a
corporate risk register,

459
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:52,015
and there's an appetite
against each of those risks.

460
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:54,540
Is it something that I cannot live with,

461
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,770
and I'll do something about it?

462
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,520
Is it something I can kind of tolerate,

463
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,860
or is it a risk where I
just put my head in the sand

464
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,030
and hope nothing happens?

465
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,040
It's one of those scenarios, right?

466
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,562
But ultimately boards, they wanna invest,

467
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,987
really where risk reduction
protects the business

468
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:11,280
and the value.

469
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,140
That's the core to it.

470
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,990
And this is about the alignment
of your security strategy

471
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,333
into that process.

472
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,280
It's also about lowering the
run costs and complexity.

473
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
Going back to that
scenario I talked about,

474
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,113
where you've got 40 plus
tools, it's complex,

475
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,750
the operational side of
it, maintenance side of it,

476
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,710
it is super complex and it
adds, I would say exposure

477
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,160
that you wouldn't really
want in an organization.

478
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,110
And measuring those threat
metrics back to business impact

479
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,370
is difficult as well.

480
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,440
I spoke about it before.

481
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,790
And the last bit is really
increasing the value

482
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,090
or the speed to value,

483
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,720
so faster delivery,
giving better outcomes,

484
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,030
and really giving confidence to the board

485
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,070
because they're ultimately
gonna have to respond

486
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,097
to shareholders and say "Yeah,
we've got this level exposure

487
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:07,047
and this is how we're dealing with it."

488
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,740
So we need to actually think

489
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,250
about how do we put
something like this in play,

490
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,400
or what kind of strategy could we use?

491
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,230
And one model that I've used in the past

492
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,523
is a maturity model.

493
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,410
So on the left hand side,

494
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,453
we've got varying degrees of maturity,

495
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,163
and on the vertical side, we've
got situational awareness.

496
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,633
Situational awareness is what's happening,

497
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,190
what should I do to combat that,

498
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,730
and what's going to happen, right?

499
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,560
What's happening, what should I do next,

500
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,990
and what will happen after that?

501
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,490
It's anticipating all of that.

502
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,670
And you can see we've got
this kind of growing chart

503
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,520
where I suppose where
you've got low maturity

504
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,510
and just got those tools,

505
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,243
you're just taking alert information in.

506
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,470
Your maturity level's low,

507
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,900
and it's very low on that
situational awareness

508
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,870
'cause all you're seeing
is just alert information

509
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,720
and nothing else.

510
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,380
As we start kind of going up that curve

511
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,820
and looking at dynamic data,

512
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,450
so let's say vulnerability
information for example,

513
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,800
we start to get a picture

514
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,040
of actually what could I be open to?

515
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,750
And we see patching regimes

516
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,060
and things like that which
kind of get you partly

517
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,110
on the front foot.

518
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:33,630
But really, where the
differentiator really starts

519
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,600
to kick in is understanding risk.

520
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,670
What does that exposure
mean in my business,

521
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,213
and how can I relate it
back to something tangible?

522
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,345
And when we start to map

523
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:47,940
what I call actionable
intelligence on top of that,

524
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,670
it really does kind of drive some value.

525
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,040
I'm in a vertical like pharma for example.

526
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,382
We see something happening with our peer,

527
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:57,210
we've got some intelligence,

528
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,250
we know it's this kind of campaign,

529
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,380
we see these kind of tactics.

530
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,730
If I know that beforehand,

531
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,580
I can start doing something about it.

532
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:08,310
And as we kind of start
going up the chain,

533
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,460
we can think about
actually reporting as well.

534
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,080
And people often forget about this,

535
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,870
reporting those metrics
in a way that makes sense,

536
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,260
reporting and against
how are we doing today,

537
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,580
how are we doing tomorrow,

538
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,257
and what's our projection likely to be?

539
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:25,240
And the analysis behind it.

540
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,430
And I suppose what we're trying to do here

541
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,410
is we're creating a journey path

542
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,904
to proactive risk management.

543
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,343
'Cause if you start putting
these blocks in play,

544
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,193
we get this kind of side
benefit that comes from it.

545
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,450
The time to fix dramatically increases.

546
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,450
We've seen recent studies
right now to every year,

547
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,440
probably gonna do it,

548
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,890
and it's still kicking around 240 days.

549
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,170
Mean time to detect, mean time to contain,

550
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,313
mean time to respond.

551
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,360
If you can get on the front foot,

552
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,384
and what I mean is if you can understand

553
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:06,450
what's open right now,
the impact it can have,

554
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,200
and start remediating them
before anything happens,

555
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,260
you dramatically reduce that time to fix.

556
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,750
You're only then kind
of responding to things

557
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,583
that you would never foresee really.

558
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,370
And that makes a big difference.

559
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,430
It goes back to the previous
slide, those three pillars.

560
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,870
This helps you kind of address,

561
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,870
give you a tick box against all of them.

562
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,300
So when we think about it
from a security perspective,

563
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,270
what are the mind shift
changes we need to think about?

564
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,120
We need to actually move
from that reactive defense

565
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,583
to a more proactive risk-based approach.

566
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,900
It's like if you buy a house, right?

567
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,060
You do risk management
every day in your own heads.

568
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,290
You buy a house.

569
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,940
I've spent so much money,

570
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,430
I've only got like, let's say $1,500 left

571
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,750
to secure the home.

572
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,130
Where do I begin?

573
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,097
You'll automatically say,

574
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:03,330
"Actually, I'm gonna
protect my front door first,

575
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,430
and I'm gonna put two or three things.

576
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,920
I'm gonna put a bolt in,

577
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,343
I'm gonna put a five lever lock in,

578
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:13,713
I'm gonna put maybe some CCC
TV in or a Ring doorbell.

579
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,593
But I've got a window up in the attic.

580
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,260
I'll leave that alone

581
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,930
because I know no one's
gonna go up there, right?

582
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,240
They're not gonna take the
time to break in and do that

583
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,710
because the risk is too high."

584
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,150
And that has to be the same
when we're looking at security.

585
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,400
Gotta take that approach.

586
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,380
Second thing is you've gotta move away

587
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,790
from those independent tools,

588
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,190
and look at an integrated platform,

589
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,990
somewhere where you ingest the data once

590
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,980
and then it can be shared

591
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,726
across a number of different capabilities

592
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:45,480
to drive different outcomes,

593
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,710
whether it's reactive data,

594
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,030
whether it's exposure management,

595
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,480
whether it's trying to
predict what could happen.

596
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:54,240
And last, it's about really mapping

597
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,633
that technical information into
business relevant insights.

598
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,080
When the question is
asked, what's our exposure

599
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,790
in terms of our Tier One services,

600
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,500
that's what we're talking about.

601
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,390
It's knowing that these alerts,

602
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,630
mapping onto these
applications, onto this compute,

603
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,090
onto this storage,

604
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,013
onto this part of the
network has an impact.

605
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,390
So what we really need is security

606
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,570
that's gonna adapt to your business.

607
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,570
And what we're trying to do really here

608
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,570
is make security a vehicle
to drive those innovations

609
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,470
in a secure manner.

610
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,990
Not the department of know, not
that kind of reactive model,

611
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,055
but actually allow you to
innovate in a way that says,

612
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,260
yeah, we can use cloud, we can use AI,

613
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,455
we can do agentic or autonomous

614
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:49,863
and know that we are
covered on these guardrails.

615
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,400
And it begins with things
like having total visibility,

616
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,710
especially in the kind of hybrid context

617
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,810
that we've seen now where you've got data

618
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,100
and applications on premise,

619
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,680
data and applications out in public cloud.

620
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,770
A need to have that true
picture be it across,

621
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,240
I would say identity.

622
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,690
So people think identity is
all about humans, but it's not.

623
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,370
In this new kind of AI world,

624
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,660
it's non-human identities

625
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,130
that we need to think about as well.

626
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,080
There's NHIs, how many people,

627
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,722
actually just as a quick show of hands,

628
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:20,521
how many people treat non-human identities

629
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:25,230
as a human identity that you
would then do kind of moves,

630
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,333
ads changes and revoke privilege?

631
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,366
And oh, one person, you're brave.

632
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:34,110
But people forget, they completely forget.

633
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,970
And it's same with like AI agents,

634
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,320
you've gotta treat them as humans

635
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,110
because they're kind of augmenting

636
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,660
what a human employee would do.

637
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,090
You need to take that kind of
risk driven approach as well.

638
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,540
I talked about looking at your house

639
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,890
and assessing where the risks are

640
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,860
and then putting your
investment in those places.

641
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,300
And that's what really matters here

642
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,113
is to get the best bang for your buck,

643
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,870
you've gotta put it in the
right place to give you

644
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,180
that kind of deliverable outcome.

645
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,530
And then it's that
strategic alignment as well,

646
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,710
those priorities that
actually lower costs,

647
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,310
that actually drive to the
business forward as well.

648
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,933
Oh come on, why isn't it working?

649
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,640
So one of the vehicles that we can use

650
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,590
is actually measuring risk,

651
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,730
and a very specific form of it

652
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,463
called cyber risk quantification.

653
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,340
Let's start off by actually saying

654
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,353
why do we wanna measure it, right?

655
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,963
It's about the very end pillar,
it's about decision making.

656
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,180
You wanna measure the risks

657
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,630
so you can actually answer
these questions around hiring,

658
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,380
around justifying the budget that you want

659
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,580
for your projects, for your
transformation programs,

660
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,743
the insurance choices that you might make.

661
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,378
Those investment decisions

662
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,240
are based on some tangible information,

663
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,820
but actually, those decisions are based

664
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,970
on two other assessments
or two other pillars here.

665
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,680
Assessment is also key.

666
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,750
You need to kind of have a view

667
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,442
of what does a posture look
like in the environment.

668
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:23,442
You need to look at the likelihood
of incidents I would say.

669
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,220
So techniques like threat modeling

670
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,010
where you might use something
like pasta as a framework.

671
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,746
You need to understand how
might an attacker infiltrate,

672
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:35,790
and then laterally move
around the organization,

673
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,790
and what's the chance of that happening,

674
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,740
what could over time as well?

675
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,210
And then it's about the communication bit.

676
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,310
It's about linking the two together

677
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,950
from the security team
talking predominantly speeds

678
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,730
and feeds to actually
talking to a language

679
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,390
that non-technical stakeholders

680
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,120
such as business unit owners or the board

681
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,020
are likely to understand,

682
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,473
people like the CFO, legal,

683
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,900
and really translate it in
a way that comes out to,

684
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,030
I would say outcomes for the business

685
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,963
in terms of operational resilience.

686
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,303
And if we look at how risk
management is done right now,

687
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,420
in most organizations,

688
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,750
people are in these three
bubbles I would say right now.

689
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,370
People have either done custom
reports either using Excel.

690
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,590
Excel's a great tool, but I've
seen a lot of people do that.

691
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,822
But it's only in that
instant in that time, right?

692
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:37,800
We've seen manual compliance
reports happening as well.

693
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,473
Again, it's in that instance, that time.

694
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,560
And certainly in these two areas,

695
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,130
I've seen external auditors come in

696
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,740
because organizations
just don't have the skills

697
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,440
or the knowhow how to do risk management

698
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,490
ought to do an audit.

699
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,783
And so we see these,

700
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,383
I would say scorecards are now coming out.

701
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,790
They're basic in their
nature, very external focus,

702
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,790
no real insight into I would
say what your attack surfaces.

703
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,060
You don't really know the
algorithms they're using.

704
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,860
So we've seen some automation,
but it's not good enough.

705
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,940
Where we need to get to
is these three pillars.

706
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,310
We need some kind of continuous scoring,

707
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,743
so you know what's going on.

708
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:28,080
Your cloud and AI environment is agile,

709
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,440
it's dynamic, it's either
changing left or right

710
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,000
or growing, shrinking,

711
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,973
so you need a scoring capability
that maps that as well.

712
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:39,150
You need to understand where you are

713
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,700
in terms of compliance as well.

714
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,920
Your developers might be
bringing up new services

715
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,330
and using data in different ways.

716
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,710
Are we violating anything?

717
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,543
Do we need to know?

718
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,400
If you think about it in the AI context,

719
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,210
if you think about the
prompt that someone uses

720
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,383
and puts PII information in there,

721
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:57,780
what have we violated in one go?

722
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,113
So you've gotta have an
indication of what could happen.

723
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,120
And then ultimately, it's
cyber risk quantification.

724
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,900
And what I mean by that is
actually mapping the risk

725
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,493
to some kind of tangible value,

726
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,853
and we'll look at some
of that in a minute.

727
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,600
So risk scoring in terms
of cyber risk exposure,

728
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,830
we can think of it in two ways, right?

729
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,674
First of all, it's the environment itself,

730
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:33,690
looking at the wide kind of asset types

731
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,813
that we have out there,
the range of data sources.

732
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,380
You may even wanna do things
like comparison to peers

733
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,100
to understand what are
my competitors doing

734
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,950
in this place and how do they stack up?

735
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,993
You wanna know about trending over time.

736
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,540
'Cause once you get that
kind of information,

737
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,013
you can track it over time.

738
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,430
You can use it as a basis
for the communication

739
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,793
to those non-technical stakeholders.

740
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,103
What are the weak spots?

741
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,730
What's the most important
mitigations we need to address?

742
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,770
What's our exposure look like over time?

743
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,140
Are we getting better
or are we getting worse?

744
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,723
That's a common question
I see in a lot of boards.

745
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,150
The question is how do
you kind of answer that?

746
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,810
Do you put your finger up in the air

747
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,960
or do you prove it with
some tangible data?

748
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,680
And this is where kind
of risk quantification

749
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,330
really comes in.

750
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,820
There are various models out there,

751
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,290
but the most popular one

752
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,670
that I've seen certainly right now

753
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,750
is a model called factor
analysis of information and risk,

754
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,583
or FAIR model.

755
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,130
And what we are looking
to do here is go away

756
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,080
from that finger in the air model

757
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,660
to actually putting some
quantitative metrics

758
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,040
around what could be
happening in the environment.

759
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,585
So you're looking at information
like loss event frequency,

760
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:56,820
you're looking at the kind
of threat event frequency,

761
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,943
the vulnerabilities that are
open, the loss magnitude.

762
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,730
This looks probably very
similar to the actuarial tables

763
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,787
that insurance companies use.

764
00:37:06,787 --> 00:37:08,100
I know at the moment,

765
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,160
cyber insurance doesn't use
any actuarial based tables,

766
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,750
but this is what we're trying to do

767
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,450
because once you're armed
with this information,

768
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,030
you can take a very different view.

769
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,960
As you can see from the
curves on the right hand side,

770
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,770
we've got like a low, a
maximum, and a medium point.

771
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,560
And what we can do is we can
actually start mapping these

772
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,503
into some specific scenarios.

773
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,130
Here we can see ransomware with encryption

774
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,130
or data breach with
exfiltration as two examples.

775
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,009
What we're effectively doing
is creating a spectral range

776
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,340
that the business can understand.

777
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,670
'Cause if you think about
your chief risk officer,

778
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,980
business risk officer, that's
what they're gonna be doing.

779
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,470
They're looking at scenarios like this

780
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,060
and trying to understand what
could be the minimum hit,

781
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,830
what could be the maximum hit,

782
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,050
and what's the likelihood right now

783
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,240
based on our current posture?

784
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,564
And you can see in these scenarios,

785
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:09,630
they're just the ransomware alone

786
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,980
because it's quite topical,

787
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,110
12.3 million based on alert
and telemetry information

788
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,600
that we see in your environment.

789
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,660
And it equates to about
18% of your annual revenue.

790
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,330
That's the language, that's the business

791
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,590
that the board will understand

792
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,140
and will justify your security budgets

793
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,963
or your programs that
you're looking to do, yeah.

794
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,710
And we can see some of the
outcomes that come out of it.

795
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,160
It's very much, I would say
the language of the business.

796
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,583
It's informing decisions
and investments, that's key.

797
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,723
Now you're kind of saying something based

798
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,650
on some tangible facts,

799
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,840
based on your environment
and mapping it back

800
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,313
to some business context.

801
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,553
What you're also doing is really,

802
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,490
I would say influencing business

803
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,730
including non-cyber decision makers

804
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,950
where the key of the problem is really.

805
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,980
I talked about it earlier
about saying cyber risk

806
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,580
is a shared model now,
and it's things like this,

807
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,953
which will obviously help going forwards.

808
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:20,996
So, thinking about that mind shift change,

809
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,270
we really need to be thinking
about two factors here.

810
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,950
We need to get on the front foot

811
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,813
and have that proactive approach,

812
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,100
and I would say move
away from those tools,

813
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,612
so it's really taking a platform

814
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:37,653
or a framework based
approach to all of this.

815
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,550
If we kind of just think

816
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,550
about what does this actually look like?

817
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,370
Well, let's just step it back in terms

818
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,290
of what are the kind of core components

819
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,643
of a security strategy.

820
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,273
And look at it in terms of,

821
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:56,553
I would say investment
profile that goes with it.

822
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,960
The majority of the investment,
in fact the bulk of it

823
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,390
is in that top right hand corner.

824
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,160
It's the layered security controls,

825
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,170
so these are the protection mechanisms

826
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,700
that I talked about earlier,

827
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,440
firewalls, malware, email,
security, web proxies,

828
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,390
that kind of stuff.

829
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:20,040
And as the kind of threat
landscape has evolved over time

830
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,490
and we know that we can't do
these signature based controls

831
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,670
or kind of looking for basic anomalies,

832
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,950
we've gotta go to this kind of era

833
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,280
where really we need
to look for anomalies,

834
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,080
we need to be able to see some pattern,

835
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,940
some behavior that we haven't seen before

836
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,800
and take action on it.

837
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,200
And this is where kind of
detection response starts coming.

838
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,120
And we've seen some
significant investments

839
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,980
starting happening in this place,

840
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,753
certainly around XDR
capability around SIEM and SAW.

841
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,800
The area that we really wanna focus on

842
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,210
is on the proactive side.

843
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,290
As I mentioned before,

844
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,924
if you can address these things first,

845
00:40:57,924 --> 00:41:00,663
you can significantly
improve the other three.

846
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,530
But surprisingly enough, this is the area

847
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,423
that's got the least amount of spend,

848
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,110
partly because these
tools are disconnected.

849
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,810
But if you take a platform approach

850
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,210
and start to map in your attack surface,

851
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,611
your vulnerability information,
your attack path prediction

852
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,940
and map it in

853
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,050
with what we call the real
time telemetry information,

854
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,000
you're creating almost a,

855
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,463
I would say a cyber fusion platform.

856
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,470
You're marrying real
time alert information

857
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,660
with what a governance
and risk team would use

858
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,433
in terms of exposure information.

859
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,330
And these are the byproducts
that come out of it.

860
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,750
You're gonna prevent
breaches before they occur,

861
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,710
certainly gonna reduce

862
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,410
that incident response
costs in the down downtime

863
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,180
that's associated with it.

864
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,640
And that shift from reactive overspending

865
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,243
to predictive defenses as well.

866
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,383
So, how do you go about doing this?

867
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,073
One approach is you could
build the platform yourself.

868
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,220
Question is, do you have the
time, the money, the expertise?

869
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,360
And you go back to the trap

870
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,090
that I spoke about probably
about half an hour ago,

871
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,380
I think nearly.

872
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,700
Now, you've got all these tools

873
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,520
and you've got the
complexity of managing them.

874
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,563
Or you could look to see what AWS

875
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:29,730
and Trend Micro are doing in this space

876
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,143
and take a platform
approach that's integrated,

877
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,610
not only from an independent
security vendor like us,

878
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,460
but also with the cloud fabric itself.

879
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,560
And we have a platform called Vision One

880
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,540
that does exactly this.

881
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,840
You think about the
capabilities of the cloud,

882
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,843
a lot of people are looking
at things like C. Napp.

883
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,180
If the platform gives you that

884
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,410
in that top right hand corner,

885
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,570
but also gives you risk information,

886
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,920
say actually we see these
things, this could occur,

887
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,870
then you start to leverage tools

888
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,870
and that telemetered together
to take some proactive action.

889
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,520
So what does actually Vision One give you?

890
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,650
It gives you kind of
three things at its core.

891
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,090
It's about that visibility piece,

892
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,910
giving you a complete picture
across your enterprise.

893
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,260
And what I mean complete picture,

894
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,839
I mean everything from
on-premise, out to the cloud,

895
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,250
and across that full stack,

896
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,290
whether it's infrastructure as a service,

897
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,073
platform as a service,
software as a service, yeah.

898
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,460
It's given you that
prioritization as well.

899
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,152
So we talked about the risks,
talked about the exposure,

900
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:43,650
that's fine, but where do
you start on that list?

901
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,580
What matters the most?

902
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,830
The platform, because it's
got contextual information

903
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,154
about your business critical assets.

904
00:43:49,154 --> 00:43:52,020
We can start giving you
a list of where to begin

905
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,910
and then go forward from there.

906
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,860
And we'll also give you the mitigations

907
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,153
that go with it as well.

908
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,080
How do I fix this misconfiguration?

909
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,880
Oh how do I change the
permissions on this,

910
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,243
so it's a bit more kind of
acceptable corporate governance?

911
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,733
And when we get this right,

912
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:15,693
your kind of security platform,

913
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:19,500
it kind of helps your
business kind of go forward.

914
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,840
It actually becomes ingrained

915
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,280
and becomes a business enabler

916
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,040
for your initiatives, for your programs.

917
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,090
'Cause what we're starting to do now

918
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,573
is we're holistically
managing cyber risk in one go.

919
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:35,220
We're actually streamlining,
I would say SecOps

920
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,557
or Security Operations with automation

921
00:44:38,557 --> 00:44:40,773
and contextual visibility.

922
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,080
We're strengthening compliance

923
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,303
through automated
reporting and dashboards.

924
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,890
But most importantly,
we're bridging that gap

925
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,590
between leadership and operations

926
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,630
'cause that's where the gap is right now.

927
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,870
That's why security spend or
budget availability is so low

928
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,230
because leadership just
can't see the connection

929
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,180
between I'm spending so much money

930
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,880
on these technology components

931
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,030
and what does it mean
back to the business.

932
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,670
Okay, and we'll see a
practical example of this now.

933
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,514
So this is with Northeast
Georgia Health System,

934
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,330
and I'll just pop the statement

935
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,643
from Stuart Samples, the CTO.

936
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,260
Northeast Georgia Health System

937
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,723
is a regional healthcare
delivery provider.

938
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,220
They're a nonprofit
community health system,

939
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,990
which is based around five
campus hospitals I would say.

940
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,066
They have about 1,000
beds, 1,500 medical staff,

941
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:45,066
specializing over 60 specialties, right?

942
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,890
It was vital for NGHS to architect

943
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,074
and operate a secure 24/7,

944
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:55,980
so 24 X 7 solution to meet the needs

945
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,274
of critical operating environment.

946
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:02,280
And this is an environment
where you've got on-premise,

947
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,660
you've got legacy, you've got
new stuff, you've got that IT,

948
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,490
and you've got OT boundaries as well,

949
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,140
so marrying all of that together.

950
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,893
And you can see from Stuart's statement.

951
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,153
Actually, when he approached
Trend Micro and AWS,

952
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,060
his intention was about risk
reduction was his main goal.

953
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,920
And his kind of biggest area of concern

954
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,210
was the attack surface,

955
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,660
internal and external and
getting a handle on that,

956
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,740
knowing what's out there,

957
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,133
what does the exposure look
like, and what does it mean?

958
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,610
And we can see that these
are the challenges, right?

959
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,760
So he had exactly what I spoke about,

960
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,560
that fragmented visibility
with lots of different tools,

961
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,130
inefficient threat detections,

962
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,890
having to do that manual
correlation every time

963
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,773
and that kind of operational
complexity as well.

964
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,130
Talent resource allocation,

965
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,250
people just doing day in,
day out, alert triage,

966
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:07,230
not really kind of
doing anything exciting,

967
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,400
not doing any project work,

968
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,083
not kind of driving innovation.

969
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,075
And I think after an extensive study,

970
00:47:14,075 --> 00:47:16,470
they looked at Vision One,

971
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,720
and these are the solutions they took.

972
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,510
They took the cyber risk
exposure management module

973
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,070
to give them that kind of foresight

974
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,870
and understanding what could happen.

975
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,330
They used cloud extensively

976
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,670
so they put the cloud
security elements as well,

977
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,933
endpoint and email.

978
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,140
And then they also took
threat intelligence as well.

979
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,760
So you can see the elements

980
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,410
of the platform coming
together to give that picture.

981
00:47:40,244 --> 00:47:44,790
And these are the kind of
real world business impacts

982
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,500
that they got out of it.

983
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,420
60% reduction in time spent
chasing false positives.

984
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,970
I mean, that's huge on its own.

985
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,270
I would say Trend Vision
One has enabled them

986
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,873
to secure its rapidly growing systems.

987
00:48:01,855 --> 00:48:04,320
Gives them both that proactive

988
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,423
and reactive kind of security strategies,

989
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,050
and gives them a handle on
that attack surface as well,

990
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,293
assessing risk and mitigating
those active threats.

991
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,890
The XDR capabilities

992
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,633
have helped improve the team's efficiency

993
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:22,563
and providing that centralized
visibility as well.

994
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,680
And again, bottom right hand
corner, simplified reporting

995
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,160
to board of directors,
that's helped them huge

996
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,530
'cause that's now secured some

997
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,390
of their investment profile going forward

998
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,240
for other initiatives that they want.

999
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,120
You can read the full
story on the QR code.

1000
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,170
I'll leave it up for a few minutes.

1001
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,393
Don't worry, it is good (chuckles).

1002
00:48:45,393 --> 00:48:48,360
I know QR codes have
got a bit of an issue,

1003
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,713
but no, it is good.

1004
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:54,660
And let's quickly start to wrap this up.

1005
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,700
So what have we spoken about?

1006
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,930
Cyber risk is a business risk.

1007
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,610
I think you can all understand that now

1008
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,760
and why it's important.

1009
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,210
You've gotta measure it, manage it,

1010
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,460
and mitigate it like
any other business risk.

1011
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,550
A proactive platform-based approach

1012
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,980
is what will drive that resilience,

1013
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,540
being able to operate
under stress conditions,

1014
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,943
disruption or any kind of outage.

1015
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,642
And really what Trend Vision
One and AWS combined together,

1016
00:49:22,642 --> 00:49:24,483
really just make it simple.

1017
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,510
And if you're up for it
and you can crack the code,

1018
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,403
come down to the stand and
you could win $10,000 as well.

1019
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:36,720
I think there might be some Trend people

1020
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,650
in the audience as well.

1021
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,360
They might have one or two of the numbers

1022
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,153
if you ask them nicely, but let's see.

1023
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,273
And that's it really.

1024
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,680
So I'll open the floor up to any questions

1025
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,580
that anyone's got.

1026
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,886
No?

1027
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,187
In that case, thank you very much.

1028
00:49:54,187 --> 00:49:55,475
Enjoy the rest of the day.

1029
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:56,889
(audience applauding)
