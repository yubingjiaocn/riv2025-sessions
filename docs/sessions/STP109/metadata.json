  "abstract": "Physics AI models for automotive aerodynamics traditionally struggle with real-world applications due to limited training data diversity. PhysicsX addresses this challenge with their new Large Physics Model (LPM), powered by AWS's GPU-accelerated CFD simulations and active learning to generate diverse automotive geometry training data. Learn about how this foundation model significantly reduced fine-tuning requirements and has already been successfully deployed at major automotive manufacturers demonstrating how data diversity and scalable computing can drive practical engineering solutions.",
