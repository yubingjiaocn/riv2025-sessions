1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,869
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,459
Um, I'm Ambuj Gupta

3
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:05,459
from uh PWC, uh, director

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,549
in AI engineering.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,970
Um, with me today we have,

6
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:10,398
uh, Kevin as well

7
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,849
who's, uh, uh, also from, uh,

8
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,810
PWC director in AI engineering,

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,339
uh, Nafi and, uh, Nafi and Wale

10
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,958
who are from the automated, uh,

11
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,339
uh, reasoning team who actually helped with

12
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,420
this overall solution.

13
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:25,019
So today we are gonna talk about

14
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,199
how we are, uh.

15
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,809
Utilizing automated reasoning in addition

16
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,969
to bedrock, uh, to bring

17
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,368
a more accurate and verifiable answers,

18
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,109
uh, to different inquiries, be it be, uh,

19
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,918
any sector.

20
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,389
So, uh, let me get into that.

21
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:43,298
So let's talk about that, uh, why

22
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,469
did we

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,630
Why did we come up with automated reasoning? Uh,

24
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,840
what is automated reason and why do we

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,609
need it when we already have guard rails,

26
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,329
right? So,

27
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,408
We all know that in the last many

28
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:58,728
years, a couple of years, we have seen tremendous

29
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:00,929
progress with respect to LLM's Gen AI,

30
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:01,709
and we have seen

31
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,689
it is spanning in all the dimensions and horizons

32
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,370
with the

33
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:06,959
greatest speed,

34
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,370
but one consistent problem we have seen all

35
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,439
the time is that the accuracy of the

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,609
answers and ha hallucination, as you can

37
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,269
see here

38
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:17,329
uh. The hallucination

39
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,680
part is the toughest uh

40
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,969
uh outcome of that where it is

41
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,010
creating a lot of problem if we are

42
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,120
dealing with customer service industry, if you're

43
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,989
dealing with the

44
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,448
industry where accurate answers are more

45
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:30,028
important,

46
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,680
then it becomes a problem when we don't have

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,689
a solution for that um in a

48
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,739
timely manner, right?

49
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:36,948
So

50
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,609
to do that, uh.

51
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,278
Uh, we have, uh, Amazon,

52
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,859
uh, automated reasoning which works automatically

53
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:44,439
with the,

54
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:45,659
uh, in the guardrail space

55
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,698
where it works to ensure that the answers

56
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:50,980
are accurate, which means that it identifies

57
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,680
and suggests

58
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,230
why this answer is correct and based

59
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,359
on what factual knowledge.

60
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,269
Secondly, that it checks for the soundness,

61
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,500
which means that

62
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,909
whether this answer is derived

63
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,549
logically based on verifiable

64
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,710
information or is it something else

65
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,949
because it always comes back with three types of

66
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,229
responses number 1, whether the answer

67
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,439
is valid or not.

68
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,308
Number 2.

69
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,808
Um, if it's not valid, why it's

70
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:20,050
not valid? And number 3, it never pretends.

71
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,179
It will say that, hey, I don't know if

72
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:22,838
the answer

73
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,210
is, uh, valid or invalid. And, in

74
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,300
addition to that, it just doesn't come back with

75
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,460
a couple of, uh, responses. It

76
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,659
provides recommendation that should we ask more

77
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,240
questions to,

78
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,618
uh, the customer, maybe information is missing

79
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:36,699
or, uh, we should pass

80
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,979
this information for another scenario

81
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,139
where we can, uh, present a different answers

82
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,080
to the customers,

83
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,729
right? So let me

84
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,080
get to the next one, right?

85
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,750
Lastly, that with the responsible AI

86
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,770
um implementation,

87
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,889
we need to make sure that any answer which is

88
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,490
provided is, uh.

89
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,179
Explainable and uh there is

90
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,969
transparency in that and it consistent

91
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,469
with respect to any channel if customer is

92
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,710
reaching out to us with automated reasoning

93
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,868
all this happened because uh as I was saying,

94
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:08,389
guardless, they have uh limitations

95
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,469
where you can do content filtering, you can do

96
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,008
topic filtering, but after that

97
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,588
what we cannot do at the scale is that

98
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:16,750
implementing the business rules and this is

99
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,929
where automated reasoning comes into the

100
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:21,588
picture to ensure that we are able to utilize

101
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:23,669
these business rules or a standard operating procedure,

102
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:24,808
be it any industry.

103
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,360
Uh, pharmaceutical

104
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,000
or, um, uh, utility

105
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,360
or, uh, financial,

106
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,939
anything where we can have these business rules

107
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:33,879
that would change

108
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,179
in uh they would vary with different subject

109
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:36,960
matter but

110
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,659
with this automated reason we are able to scale

111
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,699
it, uh, without a lot of

112
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,659
modifications.

113
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,330
Let me get to the next one.

114
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,118
Yeah. So as

115
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:51,569
you can see that automated reasoning is the algorithm

116
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,719
search for new mathematical proof. The way

117
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,460
it works is that it derives

118
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:58,179
the mathematical proof of the rules

119
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,399
and applies them on the answers

120
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,229
which are coming from GAI or LLM

121
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,599
and then provide the answers based on that. And

122
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,338
for that it uses a logical model

123
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,819
and software to explore the states because

124
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,099
it is able to search across a different

125
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,349
or vast state of information as well.

126
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,928
Yeah, let me, let me also specify

127
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,678
that, uh,

128
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,358
automated reasoning is not a new service.

129
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,449
It has been used already in Amazon for

130
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,689
many, many years, right?

131
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,290
So if you go to the next page, you would see that it

132
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,028
has been used for, uh, VPC,

133
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,389
uh, reachability to make sure that

134
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,709
if a connection should be going out or going in,

135
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,569
uh, IMS analyzer, that, that's

136
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,730
how it's able to quickly change the permission

137
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,809
whenever we make the changes in the policy or a

138
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,088
role for a group or anything like that, right?

139
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,509
Uh, ensuring that S3 block public

140
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,850
access, how can we make sure that, uh,

141
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,069
in service, which is our data, which is not

142
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,769
supposed to be exposed publicly,

143
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,269
uh, is, uh, is, um, is managed

144
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,290
accordingly and then utilizing the, uh,

145
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:02,488
inspector service as well, which is utilizing

146
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,769
the same automated reasoning to

147
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,428
identify different, uh, vulnerability and anomalies

148
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,369
happening in the AC2 instances, right?

149
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,108
Now let us, uh, uh, let me present you,

150
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,238
uh, a one,

151
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,178
diagram where you would be able to see

152
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,699
that how we have been utilizing automated reasoning

153
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
with the generative AI. So on the top

154
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,238
you would see that generative AI is providing

155
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,480
answer for uh, all type of uh

156
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,619
questions, right? But as we all know that

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,699
there would always be an answer, but

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
accuracy of it is not guaranteed, right?

159
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,759
Uh, and that's where automated reasoning

160
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,100
comes like a lawyer

161
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,428
who never pretends to know the

162
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,809
information, whether it will say that the information is valid

163
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:46,119
or it's not valid, or it will

164
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,358
say that, hey, we have to take one of these systems,

165
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,439
maybe ask more questions to the customer,

166
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,100
maybe some information is missing,

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,660
or provide some additional annotations because

168
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,879
utilizing those, uh, downstream

169
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,000
lender processes can take corrective actions

170
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,178
or maybe transfer the chat or the call

171
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,959
to a human agent.

172
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:05,619
Right? And um, uh, in addition

173
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:07,778
to that, it also provides recommendations

174
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:08,699
what needs to be done.

175
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,209
So, let me hand it over to Kevin, who will,

176
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,899
uh, look into that. Yeah.

177
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,600
Hello everyone. So

178
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,298
just quickly dialing back to everything that

179
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,319
Ambuj was mentioning here. So

180
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,178
working across different use cases, building

181
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:27,220
air solutions, different industries,

182
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:28,250
all regulated.

183
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,819
Now these are probabilistic systems,

184
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,379
so we're very aware that we're producing outcomes

185
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,420
that need to be verified. So essentially we're

186
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,019
not

187
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,459
flying blind. We have metrics such

188
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,139
as faithfulness. We build retrieval augmented

189
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,230
generation. Uh, metrics

190
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,528
that assess quality

191
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,899
that falls into the evaluation,

192
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:49,259
uh, dimension of the AI

193
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,588
solution development life cycle.

194
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,069
So when AWS came to us and told us

195
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,649
they had this specific service

196
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,209
that gave us an entirely different dimension

197
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,329
which could be brought in,

198
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,869
which could give us auditability and

199
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,850
traceability of what we're building, so.

200
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,629
Primarily what I'm referring to is that,

201
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,129
you know, there is a different branch of mathematics

202
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,548
that could be applied and effectively

203
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:12,528
verify the solutions that are being.

204
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,500
Produced and the language model outcomes

205
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,619
that are being derived for any solution

206
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,689
that you're building, you're building all of these wrappers on top of

207
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,019
language models, but there is a layer that actually

208
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,670
mathematically verifies this.

209
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,278
Now when PWC started doing

210
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,660
this, we approached it from the lens

211
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,899
of having two different concrete portions.

212
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,259
So whatever Ambuja was describing in terms of that

213
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,379
logical design and then the

214
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,500
answer verification piece is kind of what

215
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,579
we did in these two parts that you

216
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,579
see. You call it policy design

217
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,579
and then verification and testing. So staying

218
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:44,980
with that for a second here.

219
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,689
The policy design is a key

220
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,699
concept which hasn't necessarily been

221
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,119
approached in this way before

222
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,548
while we were dealing with probabilistic systems,

223
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,778
so you have a bunch of business rules. Language

224
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,028
models are good at understanding those business rules.

225
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,540
You ask models to look at those business

226
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,439
rules, follow them,

227
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:04,019
and ensure, you know, they're producing a

228
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,079
result in line with those business rules.

229
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,238
The most we used to do was, you know, absolutely

230
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,500
follow these business rules

231
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:11,379
do not

232
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,678
spell something out if you're unsure about

233
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:15,959
the solution. That's something that we've always

234
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,420
produced, but how do you

235
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,079
ensure that those results are consistent,

236
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:22,399
mathematically verifiable and accurate?

237
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,178
So this was, you know,

238
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,509
ringing good news to the ears of all

239
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,858
governance committees that review models

240
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,048
and then pass them through to production, right?

241
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,678
So. They came up with a solution

242
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,178
which first and foremost lets us

243
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:38,418
define those policies as

244
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,739
logic statements. So logic statements are

245
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:41,479
basically

246
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,399
statements that use your

247
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,090
uh and operations or

248
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,580
operations, all of your boolean logic that we traditionally

249
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,779
learned in high school, right?

250
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,619
So once we're able to derive them

251
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,058
technically what is supposed to happen,

252
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,599
and again this is where you need full certification

253
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,119
of it

254
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,519
from an actual logician or somebody

255
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,418
who has a PhD in formal methods

256
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:05,239
looking through those statements and ensuring

257
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,298
that they actually reflect the business rules.

258
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,668
Now what Nafi and Wali and team have created

259
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:13,009
is a system that's close to 99%

260
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,428
accurate in terms of deriving those policies

261
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,239
as well as verifying them because verification

262
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,009
is a step

263
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,489
where you populate these logic statements

264
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:23,529
with variables coming in from your language model

265
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,158
outputs.

266
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,729
Say you, if you have X and Y

267
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:29,320
and then R with like a bunch of other variables,

268
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,570
you fill them in and then you have a true

269
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,489
or false outcome.

270
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,058
That effectively is, you

271
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,099
know, a standardized deterministic

272
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:39,279
outcome for you to verify if the

273
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,779
model is performing as it's expected

274
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,019
based on some policy that you've laid out and this

275
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,379
becomes paramount in regulated industries,

276
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,119
right? So

277
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
that was the key thing that we were able

278
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,820
to derive from the service and we're

279
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,840
starting to sort of

280
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,399
uh. Extrapolate

281
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,399
and apply this to as many use cases as

282
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:57,940
possible,

283
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,759
so the verify and test bucket that's being

284
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,080
described here is effectively

285
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,210
testing it at training time. So you derived

286
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,359
a bunch of statements you're trying to see if

287
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,440
that applies to your use case and

288
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,080
if it works well enough, you're effectively

289
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
progressing it to inference time, which

290
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
is the deployment and monitoring solution.

291
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,529
And this is where Ambuch was referring to,

292
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,288
you know, this being applied to security protocols

293
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,288
already within AWS.

294
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,808
So in some sense, AWS is the leader

295
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:25,519
in this field.

296
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,048
They've already developed formal verification

297
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,250
methods for security protocols, say within

298
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,950
S3

299
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,889
or, you know, judging IM policies

300
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:34,489
through, you know,

301
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,908
converting. Network topology into

302
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,950
these formal statements but now given

303
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,950
the fact that we have language models this could

304
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,029
broadly be applied to any given use

305
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:43,869
case that you have.

306
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,428
So that's what we found value

307
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,469
in and we've tested this out

308
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,750
in a few industry applications so one

309
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,820
being pharma content review. So

310
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,408
you're generating content for,

311
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,070
uh, pharma copy in some sense

312
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,149
and you're making sure that that is aligned with

313
00:10:59,149 --> 00:10:59,700
the label,

314
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,750
a bunch of business rules that are

315
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,570
set out by, you know.

316
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,330
Central organizations like the FDA for

317
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,469
example, and then Ambuj will be talking

318
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,570
about utilities outage, which is the other use

319
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,048
case that we're focusing on here.

320
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,548
Uh, there are other use cases like the EU AI

321
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,570
Compliance Act where we're broadly

322
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,769
applying every single use case and

323
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,058
linking it back to the Compliance Act itself.

324
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,629
And then there's some sense of doing this on

325
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,969
cloud security where we're ensuring

326
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,000
that cloud infrastructure is compliant

327
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,250
against a bunch of rules like HIPPAA

328
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,609
or FINRA or something of that sort, right, so.

329
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,359
With that, uh.

330
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,599
Moving back to utilities outage, and I'll let

331
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,580
Ambuch go back.

332
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,389
Thank you. Uh,

333
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,190
thank you, Kevin.

334
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,389
So, uh,

335
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,190
let's talk about the use case, um, uh,

336
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,320
of the utility outage. We all know that,

337
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,830
uh, during outage situation or a storm

338
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,288
situation, uh,

339
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,960
Utility companies, they prepare,

340
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,469
uh, uh, uh really well uh

341
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,509
for situations where uh if customer is

342
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,509
uh losing a power they are able to

343
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,509
respond to that how soon our power will

344
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,029
be back,

345
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,609
how soon they'll be getting the services back,

346
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,908
and, uh, what is the, uh, what are the

347
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,019
like uh uh situations around it, right?

348
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,649
So the way we have been working with other utilities

349
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,788
is that utility they work across the states,

350
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,379
right? And every state has different, uh,

351
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,719
state laws, and they have to follow that.

352
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,200
Now, uh, so far it has

353
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,279
been that he, it is pretty much

354
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,359
determined a way to design these

355
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,139
processes that for one state we have.

356
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,899
A process which says that

357
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,119
a low, low level or maybe a low

358
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,320
priority ticket will be responded or

359
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,428
would be fixed and maybe in 10 to 12

360
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:41,769
hours, but other places the

361
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,479
uh the ETAs is different, right?

362
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,099
Not to manage all these uh scenarios,

363
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,359
uh, the system.

364
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,923
Have been tightly coupled and built in

365
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:52,024
a manner that they are doing the job, but when it comes,

366
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:53,575
uh, for the scalability,

367
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,014
we hit a roadblock, right?

368
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:57,524
So the problem that we are seeing here is that, uh,

369
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,923
customer who's experiencing a power outage,

370
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,465
they demand that, um,

371
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,303
they are provided response in a quick manner,

372
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:07,119
um. Inaccurate inconsistency

373
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,200
should not be there at all, right? And

374
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,288
there should be useful self-service options,

375
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,580
right? So they, they know that when the power is coming

376
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,639
back or there's a truck rollout would

377
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,710
happen and then there would be crew at their

378
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,399
location, right?

379
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,158
So to do that, uh, we created, uh, utilizing

380
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:23,158
Amazon services. We created this

381
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:25,308
particular, uh, utility outage chatbot.

382
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,710
So what you would see on the top is that,

383
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,408
um.

384
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,428
Outage of standard operating procedures, these

385
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,729
documents, which

386
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,389
which can change based on the states, they are

387
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,389
loaded to automated reasoning,

388
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,529
right? And what automated reasoning does

389
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,668
is that it, it extract all that

390
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:43,788
information and create mathematical model,

391
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,288
derive different variables, creates rules,

392
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,259
and index those rules, uh, in an efficient

393
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,149
manner, right?

394
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,678
And uh at the bottom you would see

395
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,960
that we have a chatbot which is created

396
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,000
using Amazon services such as Amazon

397
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,428
Lex, uh, Amazon, uh, uh,

398
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,019
Amazon generative VI application,

399
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:01,940
Bedrock.

400
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,320
We also have Lambda, and also you would see uh

401
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,739
Dynamo DB which is storing the real-time

402
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:09,649
information about uh the

403
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,700
outage situation.

404
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,094
Different, uh, across different zip code there are

405
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:15,215
many companies, they offer different version of these

406
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:15,815
databases,

407
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:18,173
but this is a NoSQL highly scalable

408
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:20,215
inform uh information database which is gonna

409
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,315
store all the insights

410
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,114
related to those, uh, those, uh, uh,

411
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,215
locations. So you would see that customer is asking

412
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,254
that, hey, when my, uh, power will

413
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:30,364
be back or what is the status of the

414
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:31,053
outage, right?

415
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,019
So generative AI or the AI

416
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:36,190
would provide an answer, but it that

417
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,529
answer has to be verified,

418
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,609
and that's where,

419
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,279
uh, automated reasoning comes into the picture,

420
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:43,548
where it looks into the answer and before

421
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,788
it let that answer go to customer, it

422
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:47,889
checks whether the answer is valid or not, because

423
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:50,109
as I was saying before, that

424
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,428
a low priority ticket should not be answered. Answered

425
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,428
in 2 hours versus a high priority ticket

426
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,460
or critical situation where someone is dealing with a

427
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,649
life and that situation that should be handled

428
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,739
quickly, right? So we want to make sure that

429
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:02,750
those, uh, those scenarios

430
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,869
are scalable and you would

431
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:07,070
see that on the subject matter experts box

432
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,849
that you would see

433
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,308
that they are able to make these changes

434
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,408
live, right? Because during a storm situation

435
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,609
we also have to make validations

436
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:16,989
and verification that what policy

437
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:18,210
should or should not exist,

438
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:21,750
right? Uh

439
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,038
Uh, so, any question at this point, uh, with

440
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:25,918
respect to this diagram?

441
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:30,099
OK,

442
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,678
so this makes sense. Uh, seems like everyone

443
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,759
got it. Uh, with that, let me hand it

444
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,308
over to Kevin. He would, uh,

445
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,798
speak about the, uh, design for

446
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:40,178
pharmaceutical content review.

447
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:41,649
Yeah, yeah,

448
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,700
uh. So getting back to this

449
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,000
particular use case, uh, we were.

450
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:49,989
Dealing with the pharmaceutical content review use

451
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:51,168
case where we looked at

452
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:54,009
pharmaceutical promotional content and

453
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:56,979
Judging or ensuring that they were actually

454
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,080
sticking to the rules

455
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,460
that were laid out by the FDA and companies

456
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,739
have their own internal rules that we need to align

457
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,779
with purely for regulatory purposes

458
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:05,840
first and foremost,

459
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,259
so the flow that you have on the

460
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,440
top is what we develop

461
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,798
basically by instructing the language model,

462
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,259
uh, giving it access to the rules so that it

463
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,399
can produce

464
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,859
judgments on what needs to be

465
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,330
updated within a piece of content.

466
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,769
Now what we found with the flow below

467
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,009
is that it's complementary to what's on

468
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,070
top, right? So

469
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,529
language models are great at language understanding,

470
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,389
so they're producing your outcomes, whereas

471
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,129
formal verification or symbolic logic

472
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,190
gives us a means

473
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,489
to take those statements, actually convert them

474
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,788
into logical statements, and effectively

475
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,529
serve as a second line of defense for

476
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,408
the outcomes that are being produced, right?

477
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,940
So in this case if you ask

478
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,019
us what did we necessarily use

479
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,099
as these rules, certain times you don't have

480
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,259
these rules documented in that

481
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,200
case you could take a perfect example

482
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,619
that you think is already aligned with all of these

483
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,729
rules and you're able to derive rules

484
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,739
out of them as well, those

485
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:02,308
examples,

486
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:04,699
so. Just to sort of

487
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,818
close what we're talking about here, this

488
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,279
is again gaining a lot of mainstream momentum

489
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,689
as of last week, well, again,

490
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,019
like I'm describing a fundamental shift in

491
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:16,098
how we're using probabilistic systems and then

492
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,880
grouping them with deterministic systems

493
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,439
just last week, Deep Seek

494
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,828
Math We do came out and.

495
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:23,088
They were using

496
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:25,930
in order to verify mathematical theorems

497
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,410
a verifier which was effectively using

498
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,630
a theorem prover or a solver

499
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:33,189
that is used within the automated reasoning

500
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,430
service, right? So I mean it's

501
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,549
only probably going to get more ubiquitous

502
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,549
as we, as we're building more and more use

503
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,088
cases here.

504
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,630
Um, happy to take more questions, but I do

505
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,900
want to pass it along to Nafi and Wale to

506
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,140
give us a sense of the roadmap and what they're using this

507
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,789
for, so.

508
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,949
Thank you Kevin.

509
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,549
So I just wanted to reinforce uh

510
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,930
about what both Kevin and Ambush just talked

511
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,400
about to highlight that

512
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,939
even though we're talking about automated reasoning

513
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:01,209
and about math, it's still like

514
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,529
really we're talking about applying this and

515
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,529
the service is generally available to

516
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,338
the through the Applied guard rail API

517
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,469
and

518
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:12,009
really what we wanna do is basically

519
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,150
um. Work in terms of common

520
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,650
sense. Like there are a lot of small,

521
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,390
uh, actions or rules that we want

522
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,769
to make sure

523
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:22,029
that they apply and the idea is that

524
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,150
you can take these rules and turn them

525
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,189
into automated reasoning policy and what

526
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,309
you're really gaining is that now you can

527
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,368
move with confidence, right? You can take

528
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,729
the advantages of uh of generative AI

529
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,618
and be able to move this confidence

530
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,068
so um we're available to help,

531
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,630
you know, feel free to reach out to your account teams

532
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,068
if you have use cases that you would like to, um,

533
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,449
you know, look into the team is available to help.

534
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,140
I'll now pass it over to Wale.

535
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,449
Yeah, thanks Nafi.

536
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,118
Um, I think my colleagues already

537
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:55,279
said everything. I'm a scientist from AWS.

538
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:56,660
Um, we've been doing

539
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,818
automated reasoning for about a decade,

540
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,039
and the idea now is to bring deterministic

541
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,140
guarantees to probabilistic systems

542
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,598
because we know LLMs hallucinates

543
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:07,140
by design

544
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,125
and so with automated reasoning. You can take policies,

545
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,723
you can auto formalize them into logical

546
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:14,983
statement, build models, and then use

547
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,125
that as a verification layout for your

548
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,074
generative AI applications.

549
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,324
And so yeah, I think if anyone wants to talk to us about

550
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:23,443
automated reasoning and how to use

551
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:25,463
it as part of Bedro guard drills, um,

552
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:27,384
we'll probably wait behind. Thank you everyone.

553
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:27,963
Thank you.
