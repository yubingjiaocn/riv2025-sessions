1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,950
- [Praveen] Excellent.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,884
Folks, I just wanna start off by saying,

3
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:07,534
well, Justin and I were quite
nervous, as you can imagine,

4
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:10,770
but seeing you all here bright and early,

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,350
15 minutes before the
session started means a lot.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,920
So just wanted to say thank you so much

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,568
for being here so early

8
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,310
and hopefully, we can do justice

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,100
for the time you've
invested in us, all right?

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,519
Just on that note, I wanna
do a quick raise of hands

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,060
if that's okay.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,340
How many of you experienced a Log4j event

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,047
that happened a couple of years ago?

14
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:35,312
More than half the room? Excellent.

15
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:38,700
How many of you were on the
frontline on MIM bridges?

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,675
Having to answer CISOs and CIOs

17
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:44,237
or CTOs, you know, around
exposure, blast radius.

18
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,990
Any of you on the frontline?

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,123
So 1, 2, 3. I can see a few hands.

20
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:51,840
How awesome was that experience?

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,319
I'm being sarcastic here,
but you get the drill, right?

22
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,632
It was chaotic. It was absolutely nuts.

23
00:00:58,632 --> 00:01:01,773
Pardon my French here,
but it was insane, right?

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,000
And that's exactly what we
want to talk about today is

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,091
how can agentic AI help you

26
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,730
and your organization be better prepared

27
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,623
for situations like the Log4j event?

28
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,050
Everyone, I'm Praveen Bhat.

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm a principal solutions
architect coming all the way

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,480
from Down Under or Australia
as we like to call it

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,340
and with me today, I have?

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,920
- [Justin] Hello, everyone,
I'm Justin Thomas.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,710
I'm a senior cloud support engineer.

34
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,210
And I spend my days working

35
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,153
and helping customers
with cloud operations.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,380
So the Log4j event Praveen just mentioned,

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,390
I was there at the frontline

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,350
and I was helping customers,
many customers simultaneously.

39
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,826
And what I witnessed was chaos.

40
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:48,809
It was organized chaos at scale.

41
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:52,350
And I would be on a call with a customer

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,516
and helping them trying to find exposure

43
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,440
and suddenly I will see five
more customers coming in

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,170
with the same problem, same questions.

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,373
So I want to take a look of an example

46
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,587
of the same experience.

47
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,690
So this is a fictitious company,

48
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,237
Manual Everything Corporation.

49
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:15,450
And imagine this Friday
afternoon, the team is ready

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,540
to wrap up for the week

51
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,297
and suddenly, an alarm is raised.

52
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:23,447
A critical CVE gets announced

53
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:27,942
and now thousands of the
instances needs Apache.

54
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:31,470
So an emergency bridge call is scheduled,

55
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,793
security director joins the call and ask,

56
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:40,365
"All right, everyone,
are we exposed or not?

57
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:45,365
Do we have exposure and
what's our blast radius?"

58
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,727
So first few minutes nobody
answered. It's silence.

59
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:53,910
The platform team hasn't
even joined the call, right?

60
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,650
And after some time

61
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,050
after we paged the platform team,

62
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,200
the platform engineer join, and says like,

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,210
I'm still trying to figure that out.

64
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,890
I need to log into the instances,

65
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,826
I need to log into the accounts,

66
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,720
see how much number

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,440
of instances are non-compliant right now.

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,160
And also I need to test this
patch that just released

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,783
before we start deploying
to the production.

70
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,157
The IT compliance manager jumps in,

71
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:26,772
asks, are we doing an
emergency patching right now

72
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:29,010
or can we do that?

73
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,743
Can we wait till a patch
maintenance window?

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,970
So the CTO of the company is listening

75
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,120
to all this conversation, is frustrated

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,690
because this looks like a
scavenger hunt for the right data

77
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,690
to make the decision

78
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:49,125
and which acknowledges that
we need better automation,

79
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,333
we need better intelligence.

80
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:56,043
This conversation is something
that I constantly see.

81
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,440
First 30 minutes to an
hour, we are just waiting.

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,516
We are waiting for the right
people to join the call

83
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,723
at the emergency bridge call.

84
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,796
And when the right people joins the call

85
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,747
it's the same questions.

86
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:14,940
These questions, which
instances are affected?

87
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,980
When are we doing the patch?

88
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,180
Do we need a downtime, right?

89
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,089
So imagine like this single
assessment, this conversation is

90
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:30,089
for single CVE and this
is going to be for hours.

91
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,850
Now imagine doing that for
multiple CVEs in a month.

92
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,343
The team simply cannot scale to do it.

93
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,800
And that's why

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,887
what if we add an intelligent agent

95
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:48,286
which work alongside with your engineers

96
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:52,650
to help identify and assess
these vulnerabilities,

97
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,570
check the compliance requirements

98
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,336
and also do the remediation?

99
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:59,340
So your team stays in control

100
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,800
but it's now augmented by these agents

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,250
to do all the heavy lifting.

102
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,350
And that's what we want to show you today,

103
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,333
the intelligent agents that we built.

104
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,740
And we can move to the demo.

105
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,780
The demo setup that we
have is pretty similar

106
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,770
to an enterprise setup.

107
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,860
So we have three different environment.

108
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,710
Dev, Staging and Prod.

109
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,710
Each environment has
different patch schedule

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,530
and also have different patch
compliance requirements.

111
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,938
The existing service
is already configured.

112
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:42,240
Amazon Inspector, AWS
Systems Manager, AWS Config,

113
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,073
these are the services

114
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:46,080
which are already detecting
your vulnerabilities

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,580
already remediating.

116
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,003
What's missing is a
intelligent orchestrator

117
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:55,800
that leads the way when a
critical CVE gets released.

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,313
That's where we add our
intelligent patch automation.

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,070
This is a multi-agent pattern

120
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,940
so there are four agents that we create.

121
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,410
One is supervisor

122
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,353
and which have control of
three specialist agents.

123
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,060
So these agents are built using Strands.

124
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,874
Now Strands is an open source SDK

125
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,614
that makes it easier
to build and run agents

126
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,860
with few lines of code.

127
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,032
And what it brings is a
model driven approach,

128
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:30,990
which means we allow the
LLMs to think on its own,

129
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,850
to think autonomously

130
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,330
and make decision to use the results.

131
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,920
And this is deployed in our account,

132
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,457
in our demo account using
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

133
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,830
So AgentCore is an agent AI platform

134
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,100
which makes it easier to deploy

135
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,153
and operate AI agents at scale and safely.

136
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:56,490
Cool.

137
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,097
So I'll switch to the terminal now

138
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:01,937
and we can see the
patching in this automation

139
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:04,683
that we build in action.

140
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,547
- [Praveen] Folks, can
you see the font okay

141
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,100
and the back especially?

142
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,550
- [Justin] Yeah. Awesome. Thank you.

143
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,211
- [Praveen] Thank you.

144
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,960
- [Justin] Okay, so we call this Patchy,

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,847
that's the name that we
are given for the system,

146
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,950
the agentic system that we built.

147
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,198
And you can see we have access
to the specialist agents.

148
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,840
So first thing during a...

149
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,930
Okay, so what you're actually
seeing is a simple chat client

150
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,980
that we build to interact with the agent.

151
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:41,391
Naturally you'll build a
proper web app in production

152
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,200
which can even integrate

153
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,580
with your internal change
systems like Jira or ServiceNow.

154
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,253
But here we just want to
like show it like simply,

155
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,240
like how we can interact with the agent.

156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,343
So chat client seems pretty simple.

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,880
Okay, so first thing,
during a critical event,

158
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,300
what I want to know is
understand the environment,

159
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,330
understand what's running
in my account, right?

160
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,351
So even the platform
engineer is taking some time

161
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:10,050
to log into the console,

162
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,220
log in like

163
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,600
what my production instances

164
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,010
protection environment looks like.

165
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,510
So ask the agent,

166
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,723
just to summarize, what's
there in my environment?

167
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,650
Okay, so I'm gonna ask it

168
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,350
to also give me the information

169
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,090
about the compliance requirements

170
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,577
for those production instances.

171
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,450
So what we are doing is we are interacting

172
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,420
with that supervisor agent that we saw

173
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,890
and it's making that necessary API calls.

174
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,810
It's reading the EC2 task,

175
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,401
it's creating the AWS Config service

176
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:49,225
and within seconds, we
have the complete picture

177
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:51,543
of your production environment, right?

178
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
In society, we get a common
configuration information

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,630
about the production,

180
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,447
but most importantly, we
see the compliance framework

181
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,367
for each in society

182
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,970
and that's useful information
for us to make the decision.

183
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,440
So at Manual Everything Operation,

184
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,770
if you see, these information are spread

185
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,820
across spreadsheets,
Excel sheets, CMDB tools

186
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,970
but here we got it with one prompt.

187
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,631
Now do you remember the

188
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,183
first question security director asked?

189
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:24,570
It was, are we exposed?

190
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,888
What's our exposure?

191
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,059
So let's ask the agent to find

192
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:32,193
if there is vulnerabilities
in our production environment.

193
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,229
I can just say prod. Cool.

194
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,620
So this time, the specialist agents,

195
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,339
the vulnerability analyst agent,

196
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,452
the supervisor consults that agent

197
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,137
and that's being built to use

198
00:09:55,137 --> 00:10:00,137
to query the AWS inspector
to get these findings.

199
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,440
And imagine if you're a security
engineer, you would do that

200
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,333
by logging into the AWS Amazon Inspector,

201
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,133
download the findings,
check the CVE details,

202
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:14,237
check if there are patch
available for that CVEs,

203
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:17,940
then download everything,
get a priority list

204
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,360
and we are talking like
hours of work, right?

205
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,662
Here, within seconds, you will see,

206
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:27,301
exactly 37.6 seconds, you will see

207
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,280
that we got all those results.

208
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,270
So the agent summarizes

209
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,730
that there is 50 high
severity vulnerabilities

210
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,100
that's there in the production environment

211
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
and also summarizes the top critical CVEs

212
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,040
based on the CVSS score

213
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,096
and which instances are affected by it

214
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:52,320
and which compliance is at risk

215
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,573
if you don't pass these CVEs.

216
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,615
Now here comes the interesting question

217
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:02,010
which was asked by the IT
compliance manager is that

218
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,070
when is the right time
to patch this, right?

219
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,860
So there is an SLA
requirement of the company,

220
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,840
there's a patch manager window.

221
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,963
How do we come to a
decision when to patch this?

222
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,854
So I will ask the agent to come and see

223
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:22,010
and tell us like when is the
right time to patch this.

224
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:27,546
Also, I'm just,

225
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:30,870
if you notice I just write
when should we patch this?

226
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,790
I'm not specifying severity,

227
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,130
I'm not specifying vulnerabilities.

228
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,650
It's because like with AgentCore,

229
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,240
we are using AgentCore memory

230
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,480
which remembers all the
conversation history that we have

231
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,272
so it's a context aware agent

232
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:49,062
and we'll go through that
once we see the architecture.

233
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,678
But this time, like you see,

234
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:53,640
it's consulting the patch manager agent,

235
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,020
there's a specialist agent

236
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,830
and it's checking

237
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:02,640
what's our patch manager
window, what's our SLA.

238
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,495
And it gives you a decision,

239
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:09,302
like it says like patching
decision needed 24 days

240
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:10,950
until next window.

241
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,930
So your maintenance window
is 24 days from today, right?

242
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,003
And vulnerability status is,

243
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:24,015
okay, it actually says SLA data
unavailable for some reason.

244
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:25,365
Let's actually check again.

245
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:41,010
So the patch manager
agent, we'll see the code

246
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,460
and in the Strands, we give this,

247
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,640
the patch manager agent access to a tool

248
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,190
which can calculate the SLA requirement.

249
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,860
And when we ask this,
when should we patch,

250
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,500
it actually go and check
what's our SLA policies

251
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,195
for those specific se

252
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:01,800
and then see a delta with the
maintenance window, right?

253
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,120
Okay, so here it goes.

254
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,580
So it says emergency patching required,

255
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,809
there's an SLA violation.

256
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,570
So there is an SLA deadline

257
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,480
because your instances
are PCI-DSS requirement,

258
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,536
so you need to patch within 48 hours

259
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:18,270
but your maintenance
window is 24 days away,

260
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,820
so that's like, you are at risk, right?

261
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,809
So do the immediate
patching within 48 hours.

262
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,570
So that's the recommendation, right?

263
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,980
So the agents helped us
avoid an SLA violation

264
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,693
and gave a clear recommendation

265
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:32,940
that you need to patch this now.

266
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,110
So up until now we identify
which instance are affected,

267
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,730
which vulnerabilities are there,

268
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,630
and we came into a decision
that we need to do and apply.

269
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,670
We need to like do the patching now.

270
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,375
So let's ask the agent to do the patching,

271
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,443
but I want to like start with dev first.

272
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,100
We checked everything
for the prod right now,

273
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,633
but we need to like start with the dev

274
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,880
and then stating and the prod.

275
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,554
So just gonna ask,

276
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:03,220
okay, apply emergency patching

277
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,713
for the dev instances.

278
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,330
So this time, also the patch
manager agent will come

279
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,640
into picture which is built

280
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,550
to do all the systems manager API goals.

281
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,130
So in the patch manager you deploy,

282
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,549
you run a run command

283
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:34,953
and you use AWS-RunPatchBaseline document.

284
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:39,700
Okay, so it's actually asked me to clarify

285
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,423
which environment should I patch.

286
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,670
Okay, so let's patch the dev environment.

287
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,692
Yeah, so at the backend,

288
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:01,083
it's going to generate a run command ID.

289
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,540
It's going to target those dev instances,

290
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,370
the five dev instances

291
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,393
and it'll use AWS-RunPatchBaseline
document for that.

292
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,081
- [Praveen] Just if I
may add, Justin, please.

293
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:13,177
I think quite interesting

294
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:16,500
to know is the smartness
of a large language model

295
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,690
to be able to understand the fact

296
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,820
that you've been discussing
about production the whole time

297
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,530
and all of a sudden you're
saying you wanna swap,

298
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,526
you wanna switch to the dev environment,

299
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,853
actually trying to get a confirmation,

300
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,990
which in a lot of instances
doesn't really happen.

301
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,420
And again, it's something

302
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,254
that you'll notice the more memory,

303
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:38,520
the more context that the
large language model has,

304
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,500
the more aware it is about

305
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,570
your organization, your processes,

306
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,520
the better it becomes with such things.

307
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,010
- [Justin] Yeah, thank you.

308
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,238
So we can see like the
command ID is generated,

309
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:52,838
the status right now is pending.

310
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,510
So five dev instances are
affected, sorry, targeted.

311
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,535
So we do have some next
steps that provides

312
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:03,180
by the agent that we can check the status.

313
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,460
Also we can type "proceed"

314
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,320
to continue to the staging environment.

315
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,413
So basically agents understand
that this is a phase rollout.

316
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,240
So we started the dev.

317
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,760
I didn't specify this going
to be like staging a prod

318
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,230
so it understands that

319
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,726
if I type "proceed," it'll start

320
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,592
patching the staging environment next

321
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,290
or we can wait and check and verify

322
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,590
if everything's fine
and then we can do that.

323
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,910
So we avoided an SLA violation.

324
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,680
We did the emergency patching, right?

325
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,250
But what about the times
that we were not able

326
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,452
to catch that SLMS

327
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,900
and that's what the CTO

328
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,203
of Manually Everything
Cooperation is thinking right now.

329
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,288
How many times we were non-compliant

330
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:50,310
just because the team were busy

331
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,263
doing the scavenger hunt for the data?

332
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,580
And this is something even
the auditor's gonna ask,

333
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,250
what was your compliance history, right?

334
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
So Manual Everything Operation

335
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,880
does not have a tool to get this

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
so let's ask the agent to get,

337
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,030
how many times did we miss the SLA?

338
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,330
So this time, it's the
last specialist agent,

339
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,810
the compliance analyst agent

340
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,120
is consulted by the supervisor agent.

341
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,920
And what it does is it fetches
the reports from S3 bucket

342
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,870
and then do the math,

343
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,150
it checks when was the
vulnerability released,

344
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,540
when we did the patching

345
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:37,410
and also check the SLA policies.

346
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,170
Yeah, so it actually checks the SLA policy

347
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,450
and see like how many times
did we did the patching,

348
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,260
which should be like done
within the SLA timeline.

349
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,210
So it says there are total six
breaches in the last 30 days

350
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,100
and also gives the breach details,

351
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,556
like these were the CVE
IDs that were like breached

352
00:17:55,556 --> 00:18:00,303
and these were the team
that were affected by it.

353
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:02,810
Okay, so...

354
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,600
Yeah, so next we want to like
explore the architecture.

355
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,060
We want to explore how we build this goal

356
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,480
and how we come to like
the decision principle

357
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,310
that we took when we were building this

358
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,578
and for this I will hand over to Praveen.

359
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:22,328
- [Praveen] Awesome, thanks Justin.

360
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,090
Couple of things that
will kind of highlight

361
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,570
as we get into the code
is the patch manager

362
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,630
or the patch manager agent
itself has the ability

363
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,080
to verify or do health checks

364
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,371
as part of its patching process as well.

365
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,350
So the reason why we can't do it

366
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,270
and just in the interest of time,

367
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,000
but under the hood it's basically
checking your application,

368
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,638
your infrastructure and
we'll go into detail

369
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,420
of how it actually does it.

370
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,420
And once it completes its patching,

371
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,700
it's uploading all that
information into an S3 bucket

372
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,070
as Justin kind of pointed out.

373
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,289
All right, now that we've
seen the solution in action,

374
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,278
let's have a look at the
underlying architecture

375
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:02,553
and code that drives the solution.

376
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,380
As you've already noticed,

377
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,862
we've got multiple agents in the mix.

378
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:08,562
This is based on a pattern
called a supervisor pattern

379
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,506
wherein you've got a supervisor agent

380
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:14,394
that manages the end-to-end orchestration

381
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,440
of the whole workflow

382
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,968
while it consults or coordinates
with specialized agents,

383
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:22,697
each of which have a specialized
role, set of instructions,

384
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:25,697
a set of tools that it can use

385
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,070
to be able to complete a given task.

386
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,170
Now you might all know this,

387
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,840
agents by themselves
don't have the ability

388
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,657
to understand the user
intent, cannot reason.

389
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:40,890
And for that intent, we
have Claude Sonnet 4.5

390
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,440
as a large language model
running on Amazon Bedrock

391
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,207
that gives it the brainpower.

392
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,788
Now even with all the brainpower,
the agents need to be able

393
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,676
to interact with AWS services.

394
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,810
For that, we have specialized tools

395
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,960
that are exposed to
the specialized agents.

396
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,580
Justin's mentioned this, but very quickly,

397
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,606
in terms of the AWS services, we have

398
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:01,980
in the mix are Amazon Inspector
for vulnerability findings,

399
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,180
AWS Config to give the
agents an understanding

400
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,920
of the resource dependencies.

401
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,350
So when it actually makes
a patching decision,

402
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,110
it understands the business criticality

403
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,850
that might have an impact

404
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,800
on the whole patching operation, right?

405
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,428
If it's let's say a web app,

406
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,020
a frontend facing application

407
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,969
that has extremely high business impact,

408
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,240
you don't want to do it

409
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,870
or you don't probably
wanna patch it, right?

410
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,908
So all that decision is factored in

411
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:31,980
by the patch manager agent.

412
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,710
This in your case could
be something like a CMDB

413
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,350
like a ServiceNow or a
Jira that you're using.

414
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,340
But anything that is able

415
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,823
to give the resource dependency view,

416
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,671
the large language model
will absorb that information

417
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,662
and make it available for
the decision making process.

418
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,960
Systems manager to understand
the patch compliance state

419
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,433
to apply the patches.

420
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:52,830
And then you've got S3

421
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,170
to store and retrieve
the compliance reports.

422
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,570
And finally EC2 to apply
the patches themselves.

423
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,920
We are using Strands SDK,
Justin's mentioned this,

424
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,510
but the one thing I wanna highlight

425
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,683
why Strands is for one key reason.

426
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,740
Strands makes it very easy for users

427
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,919
to be able to build agents

428
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,320
that can interact in a continuous manner

429
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,020
with the large language
model and the tools

430
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,420
in what's referred to as an agentic loop.

431
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,490
What that means is think of a scenario

432
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,710
where a user puts in a request.

433
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,168
Alright, patch my instances
in dev environment.

434
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:29,235
The agents don't understand it

435
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:30,930
so they've gotta understand the intent.

436
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,961
This request gets routed to
the large language model.

437
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,970
The model says alright,
I understand the intent

438
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,085
but I need access to tools

439
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,270
that can interact with AWS services.

440
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,010
So the request gets routed to the tools,

441
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,900
the tools go talk to
the relevant services,

442
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,220
come back with a response.

443
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,224
That response is fed back
to the large language model.

444
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:49,523
It reasons that and goes on and on and on

445
00:21:49,523 --> 00:21:52,530
until the user's original
request is completed.

446
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,110
Now all of this happens within

447
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,070
what's called an agentic loop.

448
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,910
You don't need to code it.

449
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,080
It's just made available to you

450
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,428
and I'll show you when we
get to the code itself.

451
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,240
And very quickly in terms of scale

452
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,509
and security, it was super easy for us

453
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:06,960
to just deploy onto AgentCore.

454
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,000
AgentCore comes with seven perimeters,

455
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,069
if I'm not wrong, six to seven,

456
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,240
but we are only using three of those.

457
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,680
Runtime to actually
host and run our agents,

458
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,830
memory for making the
agents context aware,

459
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,800
and finally observability

460
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,516
to be able to understand
the state of our agents

461
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:27,248
by using tracing, metrics, logs.

462
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:29,880
All of which are very, very useful

463
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,585
when you're trying to debug a situation,

464
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,660
when you're trying to iterate

465
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,730
or evaluate your prompts,

466
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,563
you're making changes

467
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,812
to your large language
model parameters, et cetera.

468
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:40,200
All of that, observability
makes it super easy

469
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,693
for you to get that information.

470
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,193
And that's it.

471
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,912
Now, when Justin and I
came up with this idea,

472
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,470
this is like four months ago,

473
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,060
we didn't start with this whole idea

474
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,626
and like this sort of architecture at all.

475
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:57,810
We thought we'll start off

476
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,639
with something super basic, super simple,

477
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,130
understand the capabilities
of large language model,

478
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,095
understand what enterprise
users would prefer

479
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:06,682
in this capability.

480
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,395
So we thought we'll start off pretty small

481
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:12,900
and then we continue to iterate,
get feedback from customers

482
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,540
and then iterate again and
then again and again and again.

483
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,570
So we thought in the next 30 odd minutes

484
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,550
that we have left, we'll
kind of take you all

485
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,050
on that accelerated experience

486
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,200
of how we started off
with something very basic

487
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,820
and then how we iterated

488
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,400
and how we got to the stage
where Patchy is today.

489
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,696
So hopefully you can
leverage, you know, the tips

490
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:35,248
and practices that we followed,
the architecture patterns

491
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,665
to get you and your teams

492
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,750
to a stage where you are more comfortable

493
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,910
to be able to handle the Log4j event.

494
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,920
Sounds okay? Cool.

495
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,103
I'm gonna swap quickly to my demo screen.

496
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,263
All right. Excellent.

497
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,293
Okay.

498
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,953
So what we started off

499
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:07,260
with first was a super simple EC2 agent

500
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,540
that could just list
all your EC2 instances,

501
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,230
to get the compliance state, right?

502
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,103
So let's just start off with that. Okay.

503
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,680
If it's okay, I'm just
gonna get rid of the screen,

504
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,310
and make this a little bit on the left.

505
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,080
Yeah, perfect. Can you see okay?

506
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,670
All right, so I'm gonna start off

507
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:28,670
with importing of some main class.

508
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,960
So the agent class is the main class

509
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,040
because it's the core interface

510
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,990
into your large language model

511
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,137
for your conversation
management and all of that.

512
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:42,303
So this is the most
important class that you need

513
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:44,475
and then for your agent to be able to...

514
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:47,400
Wow, I'm a terrible typist.

515
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,810
For your agents to be able to interact

516
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,169
with your AWS services, you need a tool

517
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,487
and Strands has this built
in tool called use_aws

518
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:59,396
that's available with the Strands library.

519
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:02,760
And then I'm gonna just
quickly define the agent.

520
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,350
Start off with a name.

521
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,683
Yes, agents have their own identity now.

522
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,973
And then give it a system prompt.

523
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,680
System prompt is where you
specify the role, the persona,

524
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,850
the traits, the instructions

525
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,980
that you want your agent to have.

526
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,847
In our case, I'm gonna
keep it very simple.

527
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:25,203
"You are an EC2 assistant," that's it.

528
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,635
And finally don't forget the tools.

529
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,810
You are gonna say use_aws which is a tool

530
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,663
that allows the agent to
interact with AWS services.

531
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,946
That's it.

532
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:39,064
Six to seven lines of code within Strands

533
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:41,070
that allows your agent

534
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,698
to be able to interact
with the EC2 services

535
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:47,112
in your account, get the
list of EC2 instances,

536
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,370
and then interact with systems manager

537
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,502
to get the compliance state.

538
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,370
That's it.

539
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,217
So I'm gonna quickly start off,

540
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,577
I'm gonna say, "List all
my EC2 instances in prod

541
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,247
and their compliance state in us-east-1."

542
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,303
That's it. I'm gonna run this.

543
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,273
Alright, Python.

544
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,360
So hopefully I didn't make a typo. Yeah.

545
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,950
So what you're seeing

546
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,783
at the very top is,

547
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:28,350
I'll help you list all your EC2 instances.

548
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,310
That's a large language model

549
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,320
actually understanding the user intent

550
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,654
and it's figured out that
it needs to do a few things,

551
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:34,896
which is get the EC2 instances,

552
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:37,020
then get the compliance state.

553
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,460
And then you see the tool invocation,

554
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,254
the response that comes back.

555
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:43,830
The intent is being reasoned
by the large language model

556
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,420
and goes on and on, right?

557
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,318
So you'll see multiple
tool invocations happening

558
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:50,479
and then it comes up
with the final response

559
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,541
which is like here are all
your production instances,

560
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,514
are they noncompliant, compliant?

561
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,480
And a bunch of other information

562
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,070
that I probably didn't need.

563
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,220
But anyways, this is just
a basic agent, right?

564
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,820
What I do wanna highlight
is the agentic loop again.

565
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,180
The large language invoked
the tool, got the response,

566
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,130
and as you can see here,

567
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,450
I don't know if the highlight is working,

568
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,363
but the InvalidParameterValueException.

569
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:16,950
And we've reached a stage

570
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,780
where large language models
can auto correct themselves,

571
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,060
figure out that the syntax
that it followed was wrong,

572
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,380
goes back to its knowledge base,

573
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,662
figure out what's the
right in intent in syntax

574
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:26,370
and submits that again

575
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,240
and it probably tries AWS Config.

576
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,040
There you go.

577
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,215
Because we said compliance
state, it goes to config

578
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,200
for some reason to get
the compliance information

579
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,734
and then figures out
config doesn't have it

580
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,429
and then autocorrects itself

581
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,350
and tries to get that
information from systems manager,

582
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,740
which is here somewhere.

583
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,953
Yeah, I'll use the systems
manager compliance API to get it.

584
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,320
So that was it.

585
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
So we realized like we can do a lot,

586
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,000
but the performance was not optimum.

587
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,400
The fact that we had to go five
tool invocations sometimes,

588
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,779
sometimes seven, it wasn't ideal.

589
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:56,790
So we thought

590
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,370
how about we make the agent
more richer, more powerful,

591
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,643
give it more tools and
tweak our system prompt.

592
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:09,013
So at this point in time, we
went with something like this

593
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,653
which had, just gonna remove this,

594
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:19,501
the same agent but with
slightly more enriched prompt

595
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,580
and better tools that it has access to.

596
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,720
And I explained to you a bit more

597
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,580
of what's happening under the hood.

598
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,260
So you got Bedrock model defined.

599
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,060
When we didn't define one with Strands,

600
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,350
by default it uses Claude
Sonnet 4 today in us-east-1

601
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,890
and also sets up all the
parameters like Temperature, Top P,

602
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,090
which controls creativity

603
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,640
and a few other things
like max tokens as well.

604
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,020
It has default parameters

605
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,087
which might not be
suitable for our use case

606
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:47,010
so we had to control that as well.

607
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,251
And in our case, we just tried like,

608
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:51,960
can you use Nova which gives
us better cost of performance

609
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,793
to see how it works.

610
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:55,100
So this was a second iteration.
Literally, this was it.

611
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,850
And then control the temperature element

612
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,460
to control the creativity
of the large language model

613
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,911
to make it as deterministic as possible.

614
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:05,760
Now for all the Python aficionados,

615
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,140
you can see the tools here.

616
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,340
I've got two tools.

617
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,020
One, to get the EC2 instances

618
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,850
and another to get the
patch compliance state.

619
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,870
It's just a Python
function leveraging boto3.

620
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,489
That's all it is.

621
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,140
The only difference is the fact

622
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,610
that we use a tool decorator,

623
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,200
which exposes a Python
function to be used as a tool

624
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,060
by the large language model.

625
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,140
And the way it does it
is by the docstrings.

626
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,800
The docstrings, as long as
you're clear and structured

627
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,770
in terms of what the tool does,

628
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,330
it knows when and how to use it.

629
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,177
So in this case you just say,

630
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:39,542
"Get EC2 instances optionally
filtered by environment,"

631
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:40,757
and so on.

632
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:42,444
That's all it is.

633
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:44,946
And same thing with the patch compliance,

634
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:48,300
we're doing the same
thing here as well, right?

635
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,434
So that's the tool bit.

636
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:51,780
Now coming to the prompt,

637
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,930
previously we saw just the EC2 instance.

638
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,140
I wanted to change that

639
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,130
because you could see all

640
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,290
that additional information coming through

641
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,123
which we didn't need.

642
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:01,030
So you could control that
using what's like a behavior

643
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,975
which are basically set of instructions

644
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:03,940
that I'm giving to the agent

645
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,191
to ensure that it follows a
few things that I wanted to

646
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,241
which is like give me the exact summary

647
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,800
sort of to begin with
and then the details,

648
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,517
markdown tables for multiple instances,

649
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:15,030
use the default region
if it's not mentioned,

650
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,775
but here comes interesting bit.

651
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:20,580
I'm building an EC2 assistant,
I don't want anything else.

652
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,097
So you can control the scope and the role

653
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:26,280
that it needs to perform
using a prompt, right?

654
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,113
In this case, I've just said

655
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:27,946
if user asked anything

656
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:30,540
about non-EC2 related queries,

657
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,962
just respond with saying,
"I only handle it."

658
00:30:31,962 --> 00:30:33,505
Simple as that.

659
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:35,804
And then being explicit with your tools,

660
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:38,310
again, you don't need to,
it's a personal preference

661
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,788
because the docstring itself

662
00:30:39,788 --> 00:30:41,163
help the large language model understand

663
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:43,217
when it should use the tool,

664
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,600
but I'm just pedantic.

665
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,661
I prefer it to be very explicit,

666
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,232
make sure the agent understand
what it needs to do.

667
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:50,810
And then the output format,

668
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,508
we're using a chatbot on a terminal

669
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:56,460
so had to follow certain
set of instructions

670
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,780
from an output point of view.

671
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,620
And then the tools,

672
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,960
as you can see we're not
using use_aws anymore.

673
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,145
We just have two tools.

674
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,220
I've got a very basic why loop.

675
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,917
Just to start thinking
about a chatbot experience

676
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,400
and that's all it is.

677
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,982
Alright, so let's invoke this one.

678
00:31:12,982 --> 00:31:17,293
Let's say, clear, yeah, python EC2

679
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,363
but with tools.

680
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,940
Comes with the request,

681
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,940
so I am going to copy paste
my previous prompt itself

682
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,023
so you can see exactly the behavior

683
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,913
but this time with a more smarter agent.

684
00:31:37,652 --> 00:31:40,140
So you'll see the streaming information,

685
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,973
what's coming through

686
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:42,360
and this is one of the
reasons why we built a chatbot

687
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,640
on terminal just to show
you the streaming behavior.

688
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,290
We probably could have
done this with a web app,

689
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,678
but it was just a bit more
easier with the chatbot.

690
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:52,256
So you can see it figures out the intent

691
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,804
and it makes only two tool calls.

692
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:56,621
That's it.

693
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:58,560
If you remember,

694
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,882
actually before I go, just
observe this behavior as well.

695
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:02,280
This is quite important.

696
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,281
The fact that it just sort
of types one line at a time

697
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:08,460
and I'll just explain what's
happening under the hood

698
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,613
and our experience, why this is not ideal.

699
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,678
It just had two tool calls.

700
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:17,043
If you remember, the
previous agent did five.

701
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:21,562
Sometimes there's seven,
sometimes two. It's unpredictable.

702
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:22,920
With tools, you start getting

703
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,143
more predictable deterministic behaviors.

704
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:29,970
Now to the point again of that
single line being printed,

705
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,077
that's because the tool that we had

706
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:33,502
for patch compliance state only allowed

707
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:34,980
for one instance at a time.

708
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,617
So the large language model
is basically making five,

709
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:38,970
there's five instances, yeah,

710
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,416
five API calls to systems
manager to get that information.

711
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,960
Not ideal.

712
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,130
Patching is the way to go,

713
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,242
but we realized that the hard way.

714
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:48,992
Not the hard way, it's just
I think we were being lazy.

715
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,850
Actually one last thing around the scope.

716
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,490
List all my lambda instances.

717
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,490
Now if you remember, this
is just an EC2 agent.

718
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,840
It shouldn't give me any information.

719
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,660
So from a security point of
view, I can build in guardrails.

720
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,970
It's just one way to do it.
There are other ways as well.

721
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,950
Probably some things that are more harder

722
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,930
but this is one way to
actually achieve it,

723
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,830
especially when it comes to injecting,

724
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,380
for lack of a better term, I'll say crap

725
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,430
into your prompt as well.

726
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,340
So this is one way to actually achieve it,

727
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,403
is having controls in place
within your prompt itself.

728
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,010
Within your system prompt, sorry.

729
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,098
So it just says I only
handle EC2 related queries.

730
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:32,730
Ignore the duplication,

731
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,430
but it's just saying, I only
handle EC2 related queries

732
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,630
and the same would apply
if you keep trying.

733
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,343
So that's it.

734
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:41,220
So we reached a stage

735
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,820
where we realized, okay,
we're able to do a lot more

736
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,850
with use_aws so we started
building more tools.

737
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,101
But the agents started
getting heavier and heavier.

738
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:51,012
So we got to a stage

739
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:53,460
where it started becoming
monolith versus microservice

740
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,900
sort of debate again.

741
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,934
Should we go with a single agent

742
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,400
or should we start splitting
into multiple agents?

743
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,753
And the reason why it
was becoming more obvious

744
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:02,516
for us to go down the latter part was

745
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:05,460
because of the hallucination confusion.

746
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,737
So simple sort of philosophy
we started following was

747
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:11,973
if an agent is not doing
one specialized task,

748
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:18,142
then it should be broken up, right?

749
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,010
So again, it's a philosophical debate.

750
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,010
Again, monolith versus
microservices, not gonna get into it.

751
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,260
I'm pretty sure we're gonna
spend all day, maybe all week

752
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,850
on it, but we are not gonna get anywhere.

753
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,380
But the reality was for us,

754
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,601
we started getting better
results by breaking it down

755
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:35,130
and evolving it and adding more tools.

756
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,240
We got to a stage where Patchy today

757
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,663
and I'll just walk you through
the Patchy codebase now.

758
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,488
Alright, I'm just gonna
close these things.

759
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:45,050
I'll close this as well.

760
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,200
So just very quickly

761
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,679
in terms of the project structure,

762
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,567
all of the agent related code is

763
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,701
within the agent folder itself.

764
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:55,740
We have a helper function
within the helper folders

765
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,730
and I'll walk you through that as well.

766
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,970
But just very quickly, the
bedrock_agentcore.yaml file

767
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,530
that you're seeing in the docker file,

768
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,290
these are pertaining to
the AgentCore deployment.

769
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,880
So they're the configuration
file in the docker file

770
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,183
that's used by the runtime
to be able to deploy agents.

771
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,510
Everything else, which is the four agents.

772
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,569
You've got the patch manager, supervisor,

773
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,095
vulnerability agent and
compliance analyst, right?

774
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:17,760
Super simple.

775
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,790
In the helper functions, very simple ones.

776
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,300
We just have memory, globals
and a few other things.

777
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,363
But the key thing I wanna
highlight is the tools file.

778
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,110
So you can either have the tools embedded

779
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,339
within your agents,

780
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,172
but the fact

781
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:35,700
that I come from a software
engineering background,

782
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,170
it was easier for me to just externalize

783
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,743
and have it all in a separate file.

784
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:42,210
It just made it easy for
maintainability and reliability

785
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,113
and few things and you can
always import it, right,

786
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:45,870
as simple as that.

787
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,360
So I've already walked
you through a few tools.

788
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,010
I'm not gonna bore you with that again.

789
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,240
I just wanna show you one tool

790
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,030
and just what does good look like

791
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,456
from our perspective, I guess.

792
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,933
So we've gotta get
vulnerability findings here.

793
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,800
I'm gonna just remove this so
you can see the whole screen.

794
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,330
Again, tool decorator.

795
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,660
But there's probably two, three key things

796
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,340
that I wanna highlight here

797
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,480
is one, the docstrings.

798
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,140
Again, if you have been
running Python code,

799
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,580
you're familiar with this,

800
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,760
but being as clear and
structured as possible makes it

801
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,070
that much better for large language models

802
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,820
to be able to understand
when and how to use it all.

803
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,130
It's garbage in, garbage
out. It's as simple as that.

804
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,936
So in our case, we define
what the purpose is,

805
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,700
the arguments, the CVE ID,
severity, environment, limit.

806
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,440
For example, being very clear

807
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,600
in terms of the default values,

808
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,640
giving examples where possible

809
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,610
and what it returns
once the tool's invoked.

810
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,274
Try and return dictionary
objects where possible.

811
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:45,621
The more context

812
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,746
that the large language model has compared

813
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:50,511
to say just a string
output, the better it'll be

814
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:54,610
in terms of providing you
with more richer information

815
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,690
as an output, okay?

816
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,643
Now one thing I do wanna highlight,

817
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:00,691
this is probably my second thing

818
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:02,910
or third thing, I can't remember,

819
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,512
is the fact that you have
optional and required

820
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:08,865
or mandatory arguments.

821
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,771
You can basically control the behavior

822
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,911
of agents using this one thing.

823
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,352
To give you an example,

824
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:17,456
let's just say you get
vulnerability findings,

825
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:21,960
if my severity was mandatory or required.

826
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,180
When the large language model is invoked,

827
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,462
so let's say Justin in his prompt says,

828
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:28,930
give me all the vulnerabilities

829
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,320
and that's it.

830
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,630
He just says give me all vulnerabilities.

831
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,295
He's not mentioned the severity at all.

832
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,590
At that point in time

833
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,890
if this was required or mandatory,
the large language model,

834
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,270
rather than assuming

835
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,730
that, hey the user is
asking me for all of it

836
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,640
so he probably assumes, they assume

837
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,570
that it is critical,
'cause critical is high,

838
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,590
so I'll just go with
the critical findings.

839
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,423
There's an assumption being baked

840
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:55,470
into the large language model.

841
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,917
However, if you enforce it

842
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,016
then the large language
model will question

843
00:37:59,016 --> 00:38:01,770
or check with the user again

844
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,470
to say, do you mean
critical, high, medium, low?

845
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,820
So you can control the behavior

846
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,897
using just the argument itself.

847
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:10,526
Other than that, it's not
rocket science, right?

848
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,348
It's a simple Python function.

849
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:14,220
We're using boto3 clients to be able

850
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,100
to get that information
for vulnerability findings.

851
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,373
That's it.

852
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:22,320
Alright, moving on to supervisor.

853
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,534
I'm just gonna have a
quick look at the time.

854
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,035
Okay, we're good on time.

855
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:27,813
So this is the supervisor
agent that we have,

856
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,865
basically the one that controls
the entire orchestration

857
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,643
for the workflow.

858
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,641
Now for the supervisor
to be able to interact

859
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,380
with the agents,

860
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,663
we're using a pattern called agents tool.

861
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,560
If I scroll all the way down,

862
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,960
you'll start seeing what I mean.

863
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,360
Actually I'll just mention
one thing very quickly.

864
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,950
So here it is.

865
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,150
So you'll see these three lines.

866
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,525
We're importing the three key agents

867
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:57,750
from the different files
that they belong to

868
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,232
and we're making them available as tools

869
00:38:59,232 --> 00:39:00,690
by using the tool decorator.

870
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,990
So I'm gonna scroll down
very quickly. Here it is.

871
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,390
So this is just the consult
vulnerability analyst,

872
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,773
which is the agent itself,
the specialized agent.

873
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:11,040
We just parsed the large language

874
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,260
sorry, the natural language request in

875
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,720
as a string allowing the
vulnerability analyst

876
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,600
to be able to understand
the intent of the user.

877
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,980
So all the supervisor agent is doing

878
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,598
is understanding the
intent, passing that request

879
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:24,390
onto the specialized agent
based on their capabilities

880
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,124
and I'll walk you through that as well

881
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:29,243
and then let the specialized
agents do the rest.

882
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,053
That's it.

883
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:34,421
So in this case, we've
just got the three tools.

884
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:36,594
We are also using the use_aws tool

885
00:39:36,594 --> 00:39:39,480
if in case a request is outside the scope

886
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,750
of any of these three agents.

887
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,810
So I'll walk you

888
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,663
through very quickly the
system prompt itself here.

889
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:49,065
You're defining what the role is

890
00:39:49,065 --> 00:39:51,990
which is a patch automation
coordinator routing request

891
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,260
to the specialized agents.

892
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,560
And I have some response
guidelines in terms of

893
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,540
what are the things it needs to follow

894
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,350
like verbosity in terms of
the output, being very direct,

895
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,960
what we actually need, what
format do we need it in

896
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,407
instead of pagination, truncating the data

897
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,890
if it's more than, you know, 10

898
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,750
as you might have seen said
50 severities available

899
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,502
but only showing 10 for example
and those kind of things.

900
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:17,340
And then the routing priority.

901
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,140
How do I want the priority to be?

902
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,395
How do I want the request to be routed,

903
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:24,510
which is understanding
the user's primary intent.

904
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,830
If it can't find that information,

905
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,241
go to the context from the memory itself

906
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:32,050
and if you can't find that as
well then route to use_aws.

907
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,953
That's it.

908
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,670
I just provide the details around

909
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,800
when to use the specialized agents,

910
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,930
which is analyze security,
vulnerability, CVEs,

911
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,014
et cetera, et cetera.

912
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:45,373
So you can use semantic
routing, keyword routing

913
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:47,430
or capability based routing as well.

914
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,380
So this is just one way we could do it.

915
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:52,263
And that's it.

916
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,482
We mentioned the tools again.

917
00:40:56,482 --> 00:41:00,870
Now if you recall in the
second agent from memory

918
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,763
when the tools started printing
out one line at a time,

919
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:05,880
this is what I was trying to get to.

920
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,620
With tools that you've defined,

921
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,720
you can control patching, right?

922
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,180
So if you've got an API call

923
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,754
that has to be made 10 times, 20 times,

924
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:16,830
then you can control it.

925
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,970
But something like use_aws,

926
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,100
which is a built-in tool,
you can't control it.

927
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,660
So you're using the prompt itself

928
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,030
to be able to control the
large language model's behavior

929
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,949
of how it should use
or leverage that tool.

930
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:28,050
So in this case, patching related queries,

931
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,270
using filters to reduce data transfer,

932
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,778
this all helped in reducing
the token consumption.

933
00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:34,528
Yes, we have to pay for tokens

934
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:36,120
and we realized that again

935
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,433
as the cost started going up.

936
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,370
And that's it.

937
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,140
It was just output format like
you know, emojis, et cetera

938
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,709
to make it look appealing

939
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:45,570
but that was it.

940
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,073
That's the supervisor agent,

941
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,840
like just to give you an overview.

942
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll show you patch manager very quickly

943
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
because that's the most complex one

944
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
and every other specialized agent

945
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,619
follows the same sort of format.

946
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,990
As you can see, we've got a whole heap

947
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,820
of helper tools available.

948
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,792
It's just because we wanted
very specific capabilities

949
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,030
to come out of it.

950
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,173
We want it to be deterministic,
we want it to be consistent.

951
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:16,803
So just walking you through it,

952
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:21,900
we define the scope very clearly

953
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,331
because what we observed was
when the scope wasn't defined

954
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:27,810
and you might have observed this as well.

955
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,890
The supervisor agent,

956
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,193
when a request comes through,
routes it to multiple agents.

957
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,600
If a specialized agent is not
able to perform the set task

958
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,760
and it's because it's not
in its scope, it comes back

959
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,320
with an outer scope response

960
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,230
and the supervisor agent
now needs to correct itself

961
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,850
and figure out which other special agent

962
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,130
that it needs to route the request to.

963
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,600
So this was extremely important

964
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,715
and something you might
want to keep in mind.

965
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:52,983
As you might all appreciate,

966
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,000
patching as a process
is extremely rigorous.

967
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,470
It is very controlled.

968
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:02,250
You don't want it to just
be done in a hillbilly way.

969
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,440
You want to control that whole form.

970
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,840
So when we started off,

971
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,113
patch manager was doing things in PADL

972
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:09,120
when it shouldn't,

973
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,410
like it was trying to do dev staging,

974
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,610
at the same time trying
to be more efficient

975
00:43:13,472 --> 00:43:15,539
but we realized that that's
not the way it should be.

976
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:17,105
So we had to bake in this concept

977
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:20,223
of workflow within the prompt
to control its behavior.

978
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,050
So the way we kind

979
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,400
of started it off was like
get the CVE severity first.

980
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,410
So either the user provides that

981
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,258
in the prompt itself saying,

982
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:35,880
hey, give me the critical
severity in the dev environment

983
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,117
and if that's not available,

984
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,390
if it's available in the memory,

985
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,800
extract it from there as well.

986
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,790
So it has different ways

987
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,444
that it can actually
absorb that information

988
00:43:43,444 --> 00:43:45,552
and use that for its calculation

989
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:47,975
and we'll get to that in in a minute.

990
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:49,526
Then get the patch compliance.

991
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,388
So we have multiple applications

992
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:53,250
running within these instances,

993
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,380
each assigned a compliance framework

994
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,110
that has an SLA associated with it.

995
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,660
So get the patch compliance
state based on the environment

996
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,060
and the severity that's been provided.

997
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,188
Now the next step is to
get the maintenance window

998
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,560
for the said environment,

999
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,427
which is when is the next execution

1000
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,583
from a patching perspective gonna happen.

1001
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Now comes the smart
decision making ability

1002
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,403
of the patch manager agent here.

1003
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,250
Now that it has the severity information,

1004
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,350
understands the SLA of your application,

1005
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,640
it needs to make a decision on

1006
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,650
if it has to patch it
in an emergency form,

1007
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:26,850
which is straightaway

1008
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,200
or can it wait for the
next maintenance window.

1009
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,347
That all happens with
just a few lines of code

1010
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:36,809
rather than a pretty large FL statement

1011
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,090
that would've probably written too complex

1012
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,293
for anybody to understand.

1013
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,450
And that's it.

1014
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,860
And then just display that information

1015
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,150
which is, hey, window is within

1016
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,678
or beyond the SLA deadline,

1017
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:50,512
so we need to either patch
it now or leave it for later.

1018
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:51,540
That was it.

1019
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,462
So that whole workflow
was baked into the prompt.

1020
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:55,956
Could we have optimized it? Absolutely.

1021
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:59,673
But we reached this stage
based on a lot of tests.

1022
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,791
Last week, we had a release

1023
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,202
as we're getting closer to re:Invent,

1024
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,307
we're actually in re:Invent already,

1025
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:07,658
but there's a lot of new announcements.

1026
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:10,770
So one new announcement was Strands SOP

1027
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,570
or standard operating procedure

1028
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,380
wherein a lot of the workflow
sort of implementations

1029
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,892
can actually be externalized,

1030
00:45:17,892 --> 00:45:20,070
which makes the prompt a lot more smaller,

1031
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,507
which means less token consumption,

1032
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:25,263
more faster larger language,
more faster agent responses.

1033
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:30,030
All right, then comes
the instance ranking,

1034
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,590
so it's done the calculation

1035
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,849
on emergency versus not emergency.

1036
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:35,190
It also has the ability

1037
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,230
to rank your instances
based on business impact

1038
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,966
and blast radius

1039
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:41,970
and then actually go
through a phase execution.

1040
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,140
This would've taken a long time,

1041
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,973
hence we can show them the demo

1042
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:46,200
as I mentioned that previously.

1043
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,480
But under the hood it has awareness

1044
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,480
that it needs to go in a phased manner

1045
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,399
even if it's an emergency
patching situation.

1046
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:55,010
And it does that, keeping in mind

1047
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,249
that health verification
is extremely important,

1048
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:59,430
which is mandatory after each environment.

1049
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,828
We've all observed this
when you patch applications,

1050
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:04,639
you know, experience something

1051
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,950
and they just go down impacting
your uptime, et cetera.

1052
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,783
So we kind

1053
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:10,133
of built a very simple
health verification system.

1054
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,608
You could build a more
complex one obviously,

1055
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:14,460
but the logic is the same.

1056
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,900
We got two layers of checks.

1057
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,840
One is a simple ping check with SSM,

1058
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,088
which is for the infrastructure layer.

1059
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:22,590
The second one is for CloudWatch alarms.

1060
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,540
Now in your case, you
could integrate your agents

1061
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,150
as a webhook with Splunk,
New Relic, Datadog,

1062
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,800
whatever you use

1063
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,570
to see if any alarms have been triggered

1064
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,070
as part of the patch.

1065
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:35,433
And if it does happen, it can roll back.

1066
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:39,060
How useful would that experience be

1067
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,890
where you can just roll
back capacity to apply

1068
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,957
because it's broken a system?

1069
00:46:42,957 --> 00:46:45,870
And it's also smart enough to figure out

1070
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,765
that it only rolls back that environment

1071
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:48,922
so that you can compare a delta

1072
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:51,750
between a previous or a lower environment

1073
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,160
that you patched was successful compared

1074
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,080
to this environment as well.

1075
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,734
And finally, all this
information needs to go somewhere

1076
00:46:56,734 --> 00:46:59,580
for compliance reporting to a CTO is happy

1077
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,620
and that happens with a specific tool

1078
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,870
and all that information.

1079
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,454
And that's it.

1080
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:07,440
We have rollback policy output format,

1081
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,353
but this is pretty straightforward.

1082
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,510
Couple of things I want you all

1083
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,583
to take away from a prompt perspective.

1084
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:18,060
I'm sure you've all experienced this.

1085
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,950
As much as I wanna say
prompt engineering is an art,

1086
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,456
it feels like there's a lot
of science behind it now.

1087
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:25,830
Few key tips that have
helped us is keep them

1088
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,774
as structured and clear as possible.

1089
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:30,210
Keep them concise.

1090
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,830
The more verbose they are...

1091
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,170
Every time the agent
actually like is working

1092
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,992
with your specialist agents,
they are taking a lot

1093
00:47:35,992 --> 00:47:37,530
of this with it.

1094
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,261
Makes it really hard,
becomes more expensive.

1095
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:42,750
And keep in mind

1096
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,630
that you don't have
conflicting instructions

1097
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,800
at the top and the bottom, right?

1098
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,092
It's happened a few times
when you've said something

1099
00:47:48,092 --> 00:47:50,700
at the top and the bottom
is completely different.

1100
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,953
Agent's confused quite
easily in that regard.

1101
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,057
Exemplify, show them an
example of what good looks like

1102
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:59,013
so that they use that as
a pattern moving forward.

1103
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:03,210
Yeah, that's pretty much what we had

1104
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,523
in terms of the code itself.

1105
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,280
What I'm gonna do very quickly is...

1106
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,170
That's all. I think I had it, yes.

1107
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,157
Can I just change that to PPT?

1108
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,700
I think we've all seen,

1109
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,163
like Justin's already shown the demo,

1110
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:27,448
I've gone through the codebase with you

1111
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:29,880
and look, if you have
time, we're more than happy

1112
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,241
to take questions either
offline depending on

1113
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:34,165
how easy it's gonna be on us

1114
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:35,233
but we are happy to take questions

1115
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:36,750
or just go out of the room

1116
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,710
and answer any questions.

1117
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,510
But we've just seen

1118
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,747
how agentic AI can help you,

1119
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,170
Manual Everything Corporation
be better prepared, right?

1120
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,850
It's technically and operationally viable.

1121
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,680
It's not if, it's just a matter of when.

1122
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,018
I'm not saying it'll just like
magically solve it tomorrow

1123
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,410
but I think we're very, very close

1124
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,960
to a stage where answering questions

1125
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,830
for the security director

1126
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,723
of what's the risk of blast radius,

1127
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,240
that was just done in seconds, right?

1128
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,400
You no longer are dependent
on application owners

1129
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,070
and application teams to
give you that information.

1130
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,520
You can get that within
a matter of seconds.

1131
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,507
Platform engineers now have the confidence

1132
00:49:16,507 --> 00:49:19,142
and the comfort knowing
that if they apply a patch,

1133
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:20,913
they can roll that back.

1134
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,988
This is especially useful
in a centralized environment

1135
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:27,030
where you have application teams,

1136
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,346
platform engineering teams,
cloud teams, et cetera.

1137
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:31,380
Super useful.

1138
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,858
Compliance managers are feeling a bit more

1139
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:36,840
at ease knowing that they don't need

1140
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,910
to rush through a critical
vulnerability just

1141
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,200
because it's critical.

1142
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,520
If it fits within the maintenance window,

1143
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,664
they can make that decision sooner.

1144
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:45,330
And the CTO is super happy

1145
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,440
that they're not gonna be in the press

1146
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,850
because they're more compliant.

1147
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,200
They understand the
health of their business

1148
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,960
from a patching perspective.

1149
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,700
And they can continue
to help the teams evolve

1150
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,533
and get better.

1151
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,910
So if there's three key things

1152
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,570
that we want you to take away

1153
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,893
are these three things here.

1154
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,073
Tools versus prompts.

1155
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,803
I think we get to a stage where,

1156
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,320
again, it's getting a
bit more philosophical,

1157
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,326
but what we've experienced is

1158
00:50:18,326 --> 00:50:21,460
tools is more deterministic,
more consistent.

1159
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,820
Prompts is more creative.

1160
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,162
It lets the large language
model think on its own.

1161
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:28,507
It works sometimes, it
doesn't work sometimes.

1162
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:29,820
So keep that in mind

1163
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,410
when you're trying to build a particular,

1164
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,240
when you're trying to
get to a certain outcome.

1165
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,073
Think about it

1166
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,425
when you think about tools versus prompts.

1167
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:38,403
Augment over replace.

1168
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:42,470
I think a lot of people
think like AI is just gonna,

1169
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,543
and this is a controversial statement now,

1170
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:45,450
I think AI is gonna take over the world.

1171
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,070
I think it will eventually.

1172
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,590
We're not at a stage there yet.

1173
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,930
Whatever we've shown you today is showing

1174
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,670
augmenting capabilities of an AI

1175
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,070
to make your teams, make
your systems more smarter,

1176
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,990
and more powerful.

1177
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,823
So they're meant

1178
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,140
to augment over replace
your existing systems.

1179
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,580
Agents will give you
the scale, the agility

1180
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,245
but they need humans to provide
the governance and oversight

1181
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:11,850
without which it's gonna
be a really bad situation

1182
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:12,843
for all of us.

1183
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,500
And finally, build
small, test and iterate.

1184
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,760
We didn't get there on day one.

1185
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,370
We've taken a few months to get here.

1186
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,420
Again, we've got our day jobs

1187
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,597
but I'm sure if we had put our
mind in just like you would,

1188
00:51:24,597 --> 00:51:26,495
you can accelerate through
the whole experience

1189
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:29,700
but start small, test and iterate.

1190
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,680
Use your observability
tooling to get to a stage

1191
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,360
where you understand what it can do,

1192
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,080
what the responses look like
before you tweak it, right?

1193
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,913
Take your time.

1194
00:51:37,913 --> 00:51:41,370
And one key thing, if I
could highlight here is

1195
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,780
even if you're not a software engineer,

1196
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,219
please follow all the
software engineering practice

1197
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:46,410
in terms of version control.

1198
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,270
Look at tools that help
you with model evaluation,

1199
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,889
prompt evaluation as you
tweak your prompts and models.

1200
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:53,463
The parameters, they're super useful.

1201
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:58,492
We are planning to publish the code soon,

1202
00:51:58,492 --> 00:52:02,430
but whatever we've built
has been based on patterns

1203
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,440
and samples that are easily available.

1204
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,520
So these are the QR codes

1205
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,490
for Bedrock AgentCore
samples and Strands agent.

1206
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,280
Hopefully, we'll have
our code published soon.

1207
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,095
But in the meantime you can try

1208
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:15,625
and take the lessons you've
learned today, hopefully

1209
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:18,673
in terms of the patterns,
the architecture principles,

1210
00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:21,663
and apply them with these samples.

1211
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:25,770
And everyone's here for
swag, I'm pretty sure.

1212
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,080
If you're not, you can come for the demos,

1213
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,007
we'll be there as well.

1214
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:33,009
But please do visit the Cloud
Ops kiosk at the AWS Village.

1215
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:36,030
But yeah, on Justin and my behalf,

1216
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,040
thank you so much.

1217
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,960
We do have five minutes, so
we're happy to come around

1218
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,860
and take questions if
that's okay with Diggy.

1219
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,696
But yeah, thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.

1220
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:46,529
- [Justin] Thank you.

1221
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:49,529
(audience clapping)
